abstract = {Gene families provide a unique system to study the evolutionary relationships between related genes both within and between organisms. We can ascertain whether members of a gene family in different species are orthologs or paralogs. We may also search for evidence that may explain why duplicate genes are present. The availability of genome sequences for 12 Drosophila species allows us to address these questions with respect to the evolution of one gene family, the glutathione S transferase (GST) omega class. This gene family is of particular interest because of its relationship with human disease and its presence in a wide range of species.},

@article{Alias2007,
abstract = {GSTs from adult Drosophila melanogaster have been partially purified using three different affinity chromatography media and separated by 2-DE. Nine GSTs have been identified by MALDI-TOF MS. In the absence of special treatments, eight GSTs could be positively identified. These were DmGSTs D1 (the dominant Delta isoform which was present in five protein zones of differing pI) and D3 (and possibly also D5); the Epsilon-class GSTs E3, 6, 7 and 9 and a previously uncharacterised, probable member of the class, CG16936. The Sigma-class DmGSTS1 was prominent. DmGSTD2 was detected only after pretreatment of the flies with Phenobarbital (PhB). Treatment with Paraquat (PQ) led to an increase in the total GST activity, as measured with the substrates 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and 3,4-dichloro-nitrobenzene (DCNB) and an increase in the relative amounts of the D1, D3, E6 and E7 isoforms. PhB treatment led to increases in the relative amounts of the D1, D2, E3, E6, E7 and E9 isoforms detected with a possible depression in the relative amount of GSTS1. CG16936 was unaffected by either pretreatment.},

@article{Provost2006,
abstract = {The prune gene of Drosophila melanogaster is predicted to encode a phosphodiesterase. Null alleles of prune are viable but cause an eye-color phenotype. The abnormal wing discs gene encodes a nucleoside diphosphate kinase. Killer of prune is a missense mutation in the abnormal wing discs gene. Although it has no phenotype by itself even when homozygous, Killer of prune when heterozygous causes lethality in the absence of prune gene function. A screen for suppressors of transgenic Killer of prune led to the recovery of three mutations, all of which are in the same gene. As heterozygotes these mutations are dominant suppressors of the prune-Killer of prune lethal interaction; as homozygotes these mutations cause early larval lethality and the absence of imaginal discs. These alleles are loss-of-function mutations in CG10065, a gene that is predicted to encode a protein with several zinc finger domains and glutathione S-transferase activity.},

@article{Low2007,
abstract = {As classical phase II detoxification enzymes, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) have been implicated in insecticide resistance and may have evolved in response to toxins in the niche-defining feeding substrates of Drosophila species. We have annotated the GST genes of the 12 Drosophila species with recently sequenced genomes and analyzed their molecular evolution. Gene copy number variation is attributable mainly to unequal crossing-over events in the large delta and epsilon clusters. Within these gene clusters there are also GST genes with slowly diverging orthologs. This implies that they have their own unique functions or have spatial/temporal expression patterns that impose significant selective constraints. Searches for positively selected sites within the GSTs identified G171K in GSTD1, a protein that has previously been shown to be capable of metabolizing the insecticide DDT. We find that the same radical substitution (G171K) in the substrate-binding domain has occurred at least three times in the Drosophila radiation. Homology-modeling places site 171 distant from the active site but adjacent to an alternative DDT-binding site. We propose that the parallel evolution observed at this site is an adaptive response to an environmental toxin and that sequencing of historical alleles suggests that this toxin was not a synthetic insecticide.},
