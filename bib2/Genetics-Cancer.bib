abstract = {Loss of the INK4a/ARF/INK4b locus on chromosome 9p21 is among the most frequent cytogenetic events in human cancer. The products of the locus—p15INK4b, p16INK4a, and ARF—play widespread and independent roles in tumor suppression. Recent data also suggest that expression of p16INK4a induces an age-dependent decrease in the proliferative capacity of certain tissue-specific stem cells and unipotent progenitors. Here, we discuss the regulation and role of p16INK4a, ARF, and p15INK4b in cancer and aging.},

@article{Amatu2013,
abstract = {PURPOSE: O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair protein removing mutagenic and cytotoxic adducts from O(6)-guanine in DNA. Approximately 40{\%} of colorectal cancers (CRC) display MGMT deficiency due to the promoter hypermethylation leading to silencing of the gene. Alkylating agents, such as dacarbazine, exert their antitumor activity by DNA methylation at the O(6)-guanine site, inducing base pair mismatch; therefore, activity of dacarbazine could be enhanced in CRCs lacking MGMT. We conducted a phase II study with dacarbazine in CRCs who had failed standard therapies (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluoropyrimidines, and cetuximab or panitumumab if KRAS wild-type).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: All patients had tumor tissue assessed for MGMT as promoter hypermethylation in double-blind for treatment outcome. Patients received dacarbazine 250 mg/m(2) intravenously every day for four consecutive days, every 21 days, until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity. We used a Simon two-stage design to determine whether the overall response rate would be 10{\%} or more. Secondary endpoints included association of response, progression-free survival, and disease control rate with MGMT status.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were enrolled from May 2011 to March 2012. Patients received a median of three cycles of dacarbazine (range 1-12). Grades 3 and 4 toxicities included: fatigue (41{\%}), nausea/vomiting (29{\%}), constipation (25{\%}), platelet count decrease (19{\%}), and anemia (18{\%}). Overall, two patients (3{\%}) achieved partial response and eight patients (12{\%}) had stable disease. Disease control rate (partial response + stable disease) was significantly associated with MGMT promoter hypermethylation in the corresponding tumors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Objective clinical responses to dacarbazine in patients with metastatic CRC are confined to those tumors harboring epigenetic inactivation of the DNA repair enzyme MGMT.},
