abstract = {Genomic analyses have demonstrated that although less than 2{\%} of the mammalian genome encodes proteins, at least two thirds is transcribed. Many nontranslated RNAs have now been characterized, and several long transcripts, ranging from 0.5 to over 100 kb, have been shown to regulate gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. Functions uncovered at a few well characterized loci demonstrate a wide diversity of mechanisms by which long noncoding RNAs can regulate chromatin over a single promoter, a gene cluster, or an entire chromosome, in order to activate or silence genes in cis or in trans. In reviewing the activities of these ncRNAs, we will look for common features in their interactions with the chromatin modifying machinery, and highlight new experimental approaches by which to address outstanding issues in ncRNA-dependent regulation of gene expression in development, disease and evolution.},

abstract = {Fuelled by new sequencing technologies, epigenome mapping projects are revealing epigenomic variation at all levels of biological complexity, from species to cells. Comparisons of methylation profiles among species reveal evolutionary conservation of gene body methylation patterns, pointing to the fundamental role of epigenomes in gene regulation. At the human population level, epigenomic changes provide footprints of the effects of genomic variants within the vast nonprotein-coding fraction of the genome, and comparisons of the epigenomes of parents and their offspring point to quantitative epigenomic parent-of-origin effects confounding classical Mendelian genetics. At the organismal level, comparisons of epigenomes from diverse cell types provide insights into cellular differentiation. Finally, comparisons of epigenomes from monozygotic twins help dissect genetic and environmental influences on human phenotypes and longitudinal comparisons reveal aging-associated epigenomic drift. The development of new bioinformatic frameworks for comparative epigenome analysis is putting epigenome maps within the reach of researchers across a wide spectrum of biological disciplines.},
