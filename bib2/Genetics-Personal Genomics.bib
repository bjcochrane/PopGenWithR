abstract = {AIM The aim of this study was to evaluate current direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic customers' ability to interpret and comprehend test results and to determine if honest brokers are needed. METHOD One hundred and twenty-two customers of the DTC genetic testing company 23andMe were polled in an online survey. The subjects were asked about their personal test results and to interpret the results of two mock test cases (type 2 diabetes and multiple sclerosis), where results were translated into disease probability for an individual compared to the public. RESULTS When asked to evaluate the risk, 72.1{\%} correctly assessed the first case and 77{\%} were correct on the second case. Only 23.8{\%} of those surveyed were able to interpret both cases correctly. x03C7;2 and logistic regression were used to interpret the results. Participants who took the time to read the DTC test-provided supplemental material were 3.93 times (p = 0.040) more likely to correctly interpret the test results than those who did not. The odds for correctly interpreting the test cases were 3.289 times (p = 0.011) higher for those who made more than USD 50,000 than those who made less. Survey results were compared to the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) phase 4 cycle 3 data to evaluate national trends. CONCLUSIONS Most of the subjects were able to correctly interpret the test cases, yet a majority did not share their results with a health-care professional. As the market for DTC genetic testing grows, test comprehension will become more critical. Involving more health professionals in this process may be necessary to ensure proper interpretations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This article provides an overview of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genomic services that are currently available in Greece and the legal framework within which they operate.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Here, we describe the landscape of the DTC genomic testing companies and laboratories by conducting a systematic Ιnternet search for relevant websites. We examine the existing legal framework regarding genetic testing in Greece by a review of present regulation. Although Greece does not have explicit legal provisions for DTC genomics, several other laws, including soft law mechanisms, create the broader legal framework within which DTC genomic services may exist.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: While the current legal framework creates a flexible environment that is conducive to DTC genomic operations, it is also ambiguous about the legality of some specific services. Given the growing DTC activity in Greece, we argue that it is important to both enforce compliance with existing law and clarify legal ambiguities that may risk limiting the power of legal protections that ought to be afforded to consumers.},

abstract = {AIM: To assess customer comprehension of health-related personal genomic testing (PGT) results.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We presented sample reports of genetic results and examined responses to comprehension questions in 1,030 PGT customers (mean age: 46.7 years; 59.9{\%} female; 79.0{\%} college graduates; 14.9{\%} non-White; 4.7{\%} of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity). Sample reports presented a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes, carrier screening summary results for {\textgreater}30 conditions, results for phenylketonuria and cystic fibrosis, and drug response results for a statin drug. Logistic regression was used to identify correlates of participant comprehension.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Participants exhibited high overall comprehension (mean score: 79.1{\%} correct). The highest comprehension (range: 81.1-97.4{\%} correct) was observed in the statin drug response and carrier screening summary results, and lower comprehension (range: 63.6-74.8{\%} correct) on specific carrier screening results. Higher levels of numeracy, genetic knowledge, and education were significantly associated with greater comprehension. Older age (≥60 years) was associated with lower comprehension scores.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Most customers accurately interpreted the health implications of PGT results; however, comprehension varied by demographic characteristics, numeracy and genetic knowledge, and types and format of the genetic information presented. Results suggest a need to tailor the presentation of PGT results by test type and customer characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract = {In this paper, I investigate ethical and policy aspects of the genetic services and web-rhetoric of companies offering genetic information direct to consumer, and I do so with a special focus on genetic risk information. On their websites, the companies stress that genetic risk testing for multifactorial complex medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease and cancer may empower the consumer and provide valuable input to personal identity. Critics maintain, on the other hand, that testing can be psychologically harmful, is of limited clinical and preventive value, and vulnerable to misinterpretation. I stress the importance of empirical studies in assessing the pros and cons of direct-to-consumer testing and point out that recent empirical studies indicate that this testing is neither as harmful as feared by critics nor as empowering as promised by the companies. However, the testing is not entirely harmless. Remaining problems include testing of third parties without consent and ownership of genotypic and phenotypic information. Moreover, the testing, although not particularly empowering, may still provide input to self-understanding that some people find valuable. Regarding policy-making, I suggest that self-regulation in terms of best practice guidelines may play an important role, but I also stress that national and international regulation may be necessary.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair protein removing mutagenic and cytotoxic adducts from O(6)-guanine in DNA. Approximately 40{\%} of colorectal cancers (CRC) display MGMT deficiency due to the promoter hypermethylation leading to silencing of the gene. Alkylating agents, such as dacarbazine, exert their antitumor activity by DNA methylation at the O(6)-guanine site, inducing base pair mismatch; therefore, activity of dacarbazine could be enhanced in CRCs lacking MGMT. We conducted a phase II study with dacarbazine in CRCs who had failed standard therapies (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluoropyrimidines, and cetuximab or panitumumab if KRAS wild-type).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: All patients had tumor tissue assessed for MGMT as promoter hypermethylation in double-blind for treatment outcome. Patients received dacarbazine 250 mg/m(2) intravenously every day for four consecutive days, every 21 days, until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity. We used a Simon two-stage design to determine whether the overall response rate would be 10{\%} or more. Secondary endpoints included association of response, progression-free survival, and disease control rate with MGMT status.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were enrolled from May 2011 to March 2012. Patients received a median of three cycles of dacarbazine (range 1-12). Grades 3 and 4 toxicities included: fatigue (41{\%}), nausea/vomiting (29{\%}), constipation (25{\%}), platelet count decrease (19{\%}), and anemia (18{\%}). Overall, two patients (3{\%}) achieved partial response and eight patients (12{\%}) had stable disease. Disease control rate (partial response + stable disease) was significantly associated with MGMT promoter hypermethylation in the corresponding tumors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Objective clinical responses to dacarbazine in patients with metastatic CRC are confined to those tumors harboring epigenetic inactivation of the DNA repair enzyme MGMT.},

@article{Shaer2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND In recent years, people who sought direct-to-consumer genetic testing services have been increasingly confronted with an unprecedented amount of personal genomic information, which influences their decisions, emotional state, and well-being. However, these users of direct-to-consumer genetic services, who vary in their education and interests, frequently have little relevant experience or tools for understanding, reasoning about, and interacting with their personal genomic data. Online interactive techniques can play a central role in making personal genomic data useful for these users. OBJECTIVE We sought to (1) identify the needs of diverse users as they make sense of their personal genomic data, (2) consequently develop effective interactive visualizations of genomic trait data to address these users' needs, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of the developed visualizations in facilitating comprehension. METHODS The first two user studies, conducted with 63 volunteers in the Personal Genome Project and with 36 personal genomic users who participated in a design workshop, respectively, employed surveys and interviews to identify the needs and expectations of diverse users. Building on the two initial studies, the third study was conducted with 730 Amazon Mechanical Turk users and employed a controlled experimental design to examine the effectiveness of different design interventions on user comprehension. RESULTS The first two studies identified searching, comparing, sharing, and organizing data as fundamental to users' understanding of personal genomic data. The third study demonstrated that interactive and visual design interventions could improve the understandability of personal genomic reports for consumers. In particular, results showed that a new interactive bubble chart visualization designed for the study resulted in the highest comprehension scores, as well as the highest perceived comprehension scores. These scores were significantly higher than scores received using the industry standard tabular reports currently used for communicating personal genomic information. CONCLUSIONS Drawing on multiple research methods and populations, the findings of the studies reported in this paper offer deep understanding of users' needs and practices, and demonstrate that interactive online design interventions can improve the understandability of personal genomic reports for consumers. We discuss implications for designers and researchers.},
