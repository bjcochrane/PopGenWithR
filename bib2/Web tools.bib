abstract = {Purpose With really simple syndication (RSS), library users can have information delivered to them automatically, instead of spending large amount of time searching databases, web sites and blogs for new literature in their subject fields. The availability of social bookmarking tools gives researchers new ways to discover, share and store information for their research. This paper aims to provide information on how academic librarians can use RSS feeds and social bookmarking tools as mechanisms of current awareness and resource discovery. Design/methodology/approach The paper focuses on the ways of keeping current using RSS feeds and social bookmarking tools. Findings RSS feeds and social bookmarking tools help manage information and save time as well as increase access to new information. Originality/value The paper showcases how academic librarians at the University of Canterbury Library teach students to stay current by using RSS feeds and social bookmarking for current awareness and resource discovery.},
