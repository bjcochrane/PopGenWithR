@article{Gantz2015,
abstract = {An organism with a single recessive loss-of-function allele will typically have a wild-type phenotype, whereas individuals homozygous for two copies of the allele will display a mutant phenotype. We have developed a method called the mutagenic chain reaction (MCR), which is based on the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing system for generating autocatalytic mutations, to produce homozygous loss-of-function mutations. In Drosophila, we found that MCR mutations efficiently spread from their chromosome of origin to the homologous chromosome, thereby converting heterozygous mutations to homozygosity in the vast majority of somatic and germline cells. MCR technology should have broad applications in diverse organisms.},

We review the history of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat) biology from its initial discovery through the elucidation of the CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme mechanism, which has set the stage for remarkable developments using this technology to modify, regulate, or mark genomic loci in a wide variety of cells and organisms from all three domains of life. These results highlight a new era in which genomic manipulation is no longer a bottleneck to experiments, paving the way toward fundamental discoveries in biology, with applications in all branches of biotechnology, as well as strategies for human therapeutics.},

@article{Bassett2013a,
abstract = {Here, we present a simple and highly efficient method for generating and detecting mutations ofany gene in Drosophila melanogaster through theuse of the CRISPR/Cas9 system (clustered regularlyinterspaced palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated). We show that injection of RNA into the Drosophila embryo can induce highly efficient mutagenesis of desired target genes in up to 88{\%} of injected flies. These mutations can be transmitted through the germline to make stable lines. Our system provides at least a 10-fold improvement in efficiency over previously published reports, enabling wider application of this technique. We also describe a simple and highly sensitive method of detecting mutations in the target gene by high-resolution melt analysis and discuss how the new technology enables the study of gene function. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Technological advances are important for innovative biological research. Development of molecular tools for DNA manipulation, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas), has revolutionized genome editing. These approaches can be used to develop potential therapeutic strategies to effectively treat heritable diseases. In the last few years, substantial progress has been made in CRISPR/Cas technology, including technical improvements and wide application in many model systems. This review describes recent advancements in genome editing with a particular focus on CRISPR/Cas, covering the underlying principles, technological optimization, and its application in zebrafish and other model organisms, disease modeling, and gene therapy used for personalized medicine.},

@article{Ishino1987,
abstract = {The iap gene in Escherichia coli is responsible for the isozyme conversion of alkaline phosphatase. We analyzed the 1,664-nucleotide sequence of a chromosomal DNA segment that contained the iap gene and its flanking regions. The predicted iap product contained 345 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of 37,919. The 24-amino-acid sequence at the amino terminus showed features characteristic of a signal peptide. Two proteins of different sizes were identified by the maxicell method, one corresponding to the lap protein and the other corresponding to the processed product without the signal peptide. Neither the isozyme-converting activity nor labeled Iap proteins were detected in the osmotic-shock fluid of cells carrying a multicopy iap plasmid. The Iap protein seems to be associated with the membrane. Three isozymes of alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli have been identified as the prevalent species by poly-acrylamide or starch gel electrophoresis when the enzyme is extracted from cells grown in Tris-glucose medium contain-ing Casamino Acids or arginine (17, 20, 25). Based on the differences in the molecular structure of the three isozymes, it was suggested (6, 26) that isozyme formation is a post translational event, and that the amino-terminal arginine residues of the two polypeptides constituting isozyme 1 are removed proteolytically one by one, resulting in the produc-tion of isozymes 2 and 3. The conversion of these isozymes is mediated (presumably catalyzed) by the iap gene product (13, 14, 16, 17; for a review, see reference 15). Thus, the iap gene probably codes for a proteolytic enzyme, some kind of aminopeptidase. We analyzed the nucleotide sequence of the iap gene to identify the primary structure of the putative protease and identified the protein encoded by the gene.
