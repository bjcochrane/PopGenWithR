abstract = {Aim Bees are the most important pollinators of flowering plants and essential ecological keystone species contributing to the integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we examine the potential impact of climate change on bees' geographic range in a global biodiversity hotspot. Location South Africa with a focus on the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) diversity hotspot. Methods Geographic ranges of 12 South African bee species representing dominant distribution types were studied, and the climate change impacts upon bees were examined with A2 and B2 climate scenarios of HadCM3 model, using MaxEnt for species distribution modelling. Results The predicted levels of climate change-induced impacts on species ranges varied from little shifts and range expansion of 5-50{\%} for two species to substantial range contractions between 32{\%} and 99{\%} in another six species. Four species show considerable range shifts. Bees of the winter rainfall area in the west of South Africa generally have smaller range sizes than in the summer rainfall area and generally show eastward range contractions toward the dry interior. Bee species prevalent in summer rainfall regions show a tendency for a south-easterly shift in geographic range. Main conclusions The bee fauna of the CFR is identified as the most vulnerable to climate change due to the high level of endemism, the small range sizes and the island-like isolation of the Mediterranean-type climate region at the SW tip of Africa. For monitoring climate change impact on bees, we suggest to establish observatories in the coastal plains of the west coast that are predicted to be worst affected and areas where persistence of populations is most likely. Likely impacts of climate change on life history traits of bees (phenology, sociality, bee-host plant synchronization) are discussed but require further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Pterocarpus santalinus L.f. (Red Sanders) is an endemic and endangered species largely confined to the southern portion of the Eastern Ghats, Andhra Pradesh, India. To understand its ecological and geographic distribution, we used ecological niche modelling (ENM) based on field sample-based distributional information, in relation to climatic and topographic datasets. Before modelling, hierarchical partitioning was used to optimize the choice of variables for better prediction and reliability. We used three ENM approaches, namely GARP, Maxent and BIOCLIM for predicting potential areas of occurrence. The ENM successfully reconstructed key features of the species geographic distribution, mainly in the forest tracts of Chittoor and Kadapa districts. GARP appeared to be more robust in prediction capabilities compared to BIOCLIM. The potential distributional area identified by these models falls mainly in regions not protected and experiencing high anthropogenic pressure owing to economic and medicinal use. The success of this model indicates that ENM-based approaches provide a promising tool for exploring various scenarios useful in the study of ecology, biogeography and conservation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Indian Academy of Sciences, Bangalore.},

We used Maxent, a maximum entropy-based program, to predict distribution of Sapium sebiferum in western Himalaya. Sapium sebiferum is amongst the highly invasive species of the world and its spread in western Himalaya is a serious conservation issue. In order to model its distribution, we used field-collected coordinates of 177 presence locations of the species.

abstract = {In order to meet carbon reduction targets, many nations are greatly expanding their wind power capacity. However, wind farm infrastructure potentially harms wildlife, and we must therefore find ways to balance clean energy demands with the need to protect wildlife. Wide-ranging carnivores live at low density and are particularly susceptible to disturbance from infrastructure development, so are a particular concern in this respect. We focused on Croatia, which holds an important population of wolves and is currently planning to construct many new wind farms. Specifically, we sought to identify an optimal subset of planned wind farms that would meet energy targets while minimising potential impact on wolves. A suitability model for wolf breeding habitat was carried out using Maxent, based on six environmental variables and 31 reproduction site locations collected between 1997 and 2015. Wind farms were prioritised using Marxan to find the optimal trade-off between energy capacity and overlap with critical wolf reproduction habitat. The habitat suitability model predictions were consistent with the current knowledge: probability of wolf breeding site presence increased with distance to settlements, distance to farmland and distance to roads and decreased with distance to forest. Spatial optimisation showed that it would be possible to meet current energy targets with only 31{\%} of currently proposed wind farms, selected in a way that reduces the potential ecological cost (overall predicted wolf breeding site presence within wind farm sites) by 91{\%}. This is a highly efficient outcome, demonstrating the value of this approach for prioritising infrastructure development based on its potential impact on wide-ranging wildlife species. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Aim To determine the potential combined effects of climate change and land transformation on the modelled geographic ranges of Banksia. Location Mediterranean climate South West Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR). Methods We used the species distribution modelling software Maxent to relate current environmental conditions to occurrence data for 18 Banksia species, and subsequently made spatial predictions using two simple dispersal scenarios (zero and universal), for three climate-severity scenarios at 2070, taking the impacts of land transformation on species' ranges into account. The species were chosen to reflect the biogeography of Banksia in the SWAFR. Results Climate-severity scenario, dispersal scenario, biogeographic distribution and land transformation all influenced the direction and magnitude of the modelled range change responses for the 18 species. The predominant response of species to all climate change scenarios was range contraction, with exceptions for some northern and widespread species. Including land transformation in estimates of modelled geographic range size for the three climate-severity scenarios generally resulted in smaller gains and larger declines in species ranges across both dispersal scenarios. Including land transformation and assuming zero dispersal resulted, as expected, in the greatest declines in projected range size across all species. Increasing climate change severity greatly increased the risk of decline in the 18 Banksia species, indicating the critical role of mitigating future emissions. Main conclusions The combined effects of climate change and land transformation may have significant adverse impacts on endemic Proteaceae in the SWAFR, especially under high emissions scenarios and if, as expected, natural migration is limiting. Although these results need cautious interpretation in light of the many assumptions underlying the techniques used, the impacts identified warrant a clear focus on monitoring across species ranges to detect early signs of change, and experiments that determine physiological thresholds for species in order to validate and refine the models. {\textcopyright} 2009 Western Australian Government.},

abstract = {The population size of Antarctic minke whales Balaenoptera bonaerensis has been changing simultaneously with profound changes in the physics, i. e., mesopredator habitat features, of the Southern Ocean. Although the two trends may not be related, distinguishing among the factors responsible requires a better understanding of minke whale habitat preferences. For the first time at a large geographic scale, i. e., between 140° E and 35° W, we use data not constrained by vessels needing to avoid sea ice to model the habitat affinities of this pagophilic mesopredator. Using Maxent, we modeled minke whale proximity to the Antarctic Shelf Break Front (ASBF) and the southern boundary of Antarctic Circumpolar Current (sbACC), as well as association with sea ice, given that global climate change is altering the positions or intensity of these features. We also included water depth and chlorophyll (proxy for productivity) as variables. Minke whale presence data were gathered using strip and line census on 55 cruises on board icebreakers during late spring and summer, 1976-2005. The most important variable was distance to ASBF, followed by water depth and sea-ice concentration. That is, found principally in waters south of the sbACC during summer, minke whales were most abundant near the outer edge of the continental shelf (shallow depth), including areas heavily covered by sea ice. We propose that as the sbACC moves south and sea ice disappears, as projected by global climate models, minke whale habitat will shrink, and likely intra- and inter-specific competition will increase. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Accurate measurement of forest canopy structure is critical for understanding forest-wildlife habitat relationships. Although most theory and application have been based on in situ measurements, imaging technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) provide measurements that are both vertically accurate and horizontally extensive. We use small-footprint, multiple-return lidar from a state-wide dataset (1-m footprint, 0.11point/m 2) to characterize the vertical and horizontal structure of successional loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and mature, fire-maintained longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests on the coastal plain of North Carolina, USA. The relationship between these characteristics and the federally-endangered red-cockaded woodpecker's (Picoides borealis, Vieillot) habitat preferences were assessed; as this species has a strong affinity for mature longleaf pine forests. Vertical structure was characterized by lidar-derived metrics (e.g., average and standard deviation of canopy height) and horizontal patterns of vertical structure were quantified by semivariograms and lacunarity analysis. Lidar metrics were compared with field measurements of stand structure and with woodpecker habitat use. We predicted woodpecker distribution using the Maxent species distribution modeling algorithm with elevation, landcover, and hydrography geospatial variables, with and without lidar-derived structural variables. Lidar successfully quantified canopy variation and differentiated between the structural characteristics of these two similar coniferous evergreen forest types (e.g. significant differences in maximum height, canopy cover, and size classes). Loblolly stands were found to have the tallest trees on average with a higher canopy cover. Both semivariograms and lacunarity analyses clearly differentiated between evergreen forest structural types (e.g. semivariogram range was 18.7m for longleaf, 32.3m for loblolly). By examining the immediate area around cavity nesting sites we found taller trees than those found across broader foraging sites. The species distribution model accurately predicted woodpecker distribution (tested with woodpecker presence, AUC{\textgreater}.85). The addition of lidar-derived variables improved the model's predictive power by 8{\%} compared to the model based only on elevation, landcover, and hydrography environmental variables. We show that relatively low density lidar data are valuable for wildlife studies by characterizing and separating similar canopy types, describing different use zones (foraging vs. nesting), and for use in species distribution models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Taxonomy has far-reaching effects throughout biology, and incorrect taxonomy can be detrimental in many ways. Poly-morphic species complexes, many of which exist in the bee genus Anthophora Latreille, lend themselves to such difficul-ties. This study employs environmental niche mapping (ENM) and traditional morphological analyses to investigate the validity of the subjective synonymy of Anthophora (Heliophila) curta Provancher with the senior synonym A. squammu-losa Dours. Eleven of fifty morphological characters consistently differentiate the two putative species, with an additional five characters sometimes separating them. Additionally, based on over 1000 georeferenced museum specimens, the geo-graphic ranges of the two taxa do not overlap. The two entities also react differently to the bioclimatic variables based on correlation analysis. We further tested the two-species hypothesis by constructing ENMs with informative bioclimatic variables associated with locality records. Their modelled distributions overlapped less than 1{\%}, suggesting discrete en-vironmental boundaries. The variables which contributed most to each species' model also differed. These differences are explored in relation to their habitats. The combined morphological and biogeographic analysis indicates that A. curta and A. squammulosa are distinct species. Based on the accumulated evidence the synonymy is formally rejected and A. curta is recognized as a valid species. Five additional taxa (A. bispinosa Cockerell, A. franciscana Cockerell, A. usticauda Cock-erell, A. u. cinerior Cockerell, A. zamoranella Cockerell) are newly synonymized with A. squammulosa and Anthophora curta var. melanops Cockerell is newly synonymized with A. curta.

Our model, applying current climatic conditions, suggested high probabilities of occurrence in countries around the Gulf of Mexico.

abstract = {To avoid unnecessary waste of limited resources and to help prioritize areas for conservation efforts, this study aimed to provide information on habitat use by elephants between the wet and dry seasons in the Mole National Park (MNP) of Ghana. We compiled coordinates of 516 locations of elephants' encounters, 256 for dry season and 260 for wet season. Using nine predictor variables, we modeled the probability of elephant's distribution in MNP. We threshold the models to “suitable” and “nonsuitable” regions of habitat use using the equal training sensitivity and specificity values of 0.177 and 0.181 for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Accuracy assessment of our models revealed a sensitivity score of 0.909 and 0.974, and a specificity of 0.579 and 0.753 for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. A TSS of 0.488 was also recorded for the dry season and 0.727 for the wet season indicating a good model agreement. Our model predicts habitat use to be confined to the southern portion of MNP due to elevation difference and a relatively steep slope that separates the northern regions of the park from the south. Regions of habitat use for the wet season were 856 km2 and reduced significantly to 547.68 km2 in the dry season. We observed significant overlap (327.24 km2) in habitat use regions between the wet and dry seasons (Schoener's D = 0.922 and Hellinger's-based I = 0.991). DEM, proximity to waterholes, and saltlicks were identified as the key variables that contributed to the prediction. We recommend construction of temporal camps in regions of habitat use that are far from the headquarters area for effective management of elephants. Also, an increase in water point's density around the headquarters areas and selected dry areas of the park will further decrease elephant's range and hence a relatively less resource use in monitoring and patrols. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {This work presents an approach to emotion recognition of affective speech based on multiple classifiers using acoustic-prosodic information (AP) and semantic labels (SLs). For AP-based recognition, acoustic and prosodic features are extracted from the detected emotional salient segments of the input speech. Three types of models GMMs, SVMs, and MLPs are adopted as the base-level classifiers. A Meta Decision Tree (MDT) is then employed for classifier fusion to obtain the AP-based emotion recognition confidence. For SL-based recognition, semantic labels are used to automatically extract Emotion Association Rules (EARs) from the recognized word sequence of the affective speech. The maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) is thereafter utilized to characterize the relationship between emotional states and EARs for emotion recognition. Finally, a weighted product fusion method is used to integrate the AP-based and SL-based recognition results for final emotion decision. For evaluation, 2,033 utterances for four emotional states were collected. The experimental results reveal that the emotion recognition performance for AP-based recognition using MDT achieved 80.00{\%}. On the other hand, an average recognition accuracy of 80.92{\%} was obtained for SL-based recognition. Finally, combining AP information and SLs achieved 83.55{\%} accuracy for emotion recognition. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Background Zoonotic avian influenza poses a major risk to China, and other parts of the world. H5N1 has remained endemic in China and globally for nearly two decades, and in 2013, a novel zoonotic influenza A subtype H7N9 emerged in China. This study aimed to improve upon our current understanding of the spreading mechanisms of H7N9 and H5N1 by generating spatial risk profiles for each of the two virus subtypes across mainland China. Methods and findings In this study, we (i) developed a refined data set of H5N1 and H7N9 locations with consideration of animal/animal environment case data, as well as spatial accuracy and precision; (ii) used this data set along with environmental variables to build species distribution models (SDMs) for each virus subtype in high resolution spatial units of 1km2 cells using Maxent; (iii) developed a risk modelling framework which integrated the results from the SDMs with human and chicken population variables, which was done to quantify the risk of zoonotic transmission; and (iv) identified areas at high risk of H5N1 and H7N9 transmission. We produced high performing SDMs (6 of 8 models with AUC {\textgreater} 0.9) for both H5N1 and H7N9. In all our SDMs, H7N9 consistently showed higher AUC results compared to H5N1, suggesting H7N9 suitability could be better explained by environmental variables. For both subtypes, high risk areas were primarily located in south-eastern China, with H5N1 distributions found to be more diffuse and extending more inland compared to H7N9. Conclusions We provide projections of our risk models to public health policy makers so that specific high risk areas can be targeted for control measures. We recommend comparing H5N1 and H7N9 prevalence rates and survivability in the natural environment to better understand the role of animal and environmental transmission in human infections. {\textcopyright} 2017 Bui et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

abstract = {Various statistical techniques have been used to model species suitable environmental niche. This study performed a comprehensive assessment of statistical techniques and examined whether model predictions are associated with ecological characteristics of species. We chose two representative species: widespread species, Chinese guger tree (CGT) and semi-cluster species Formosan rhododendrons (FR) in the Huisun study area in Taiwan as modeling target. Eight algorithms, including decision tee (DT), discrimnant analysis (DA), logistic multiple regression (LMR), maximum entropy (MAXENT), DOMAIN, BIOCLIM, generalized linear models (GLM), maximum likelihood ML), were used in a GIS to incorporate topographic factors and vegetation index for species distribution modeling (SDM). Model performance was evaluated based on kappa index, Independent t-test, and Bonferroni multiple comparison. The results indicated that models had strikingly different predictive abilities among them. The overall modeling accuracies of FR species were higher than those of CGT species and ecological characteristics of species affected predictive performance of models. DT, MAXENT, and DOMAIN were the best among the eight models. More importantly, SDM models merely based on topographic variables and their sample distribution could not be applied on a larger spatial scale since the topographic attributes of Tong-Feng and Kuan-Dau watersheds in Huisun are different. Consequently, the predictions from models built based on samples only from one watershed could not be accurately extrapolated to another; however, SDM performance of FRs was still better than that of CGTs. Improving model performance would be to run models on an iterative basis, and future work would incorporate predictor variables with soil and microclimate into a model so that it can be improved in accuracy and applied at a larger region.},

abstract = {Predicting the potential range of invasive species is essential for risk assessment, monitoring, and management, and it can also inform us about a species' overall potential invasiveness. However, modeling the distribution of invasive species that have not reached their equilibrium distribution can be problematic for many predictive approaches. We apply the modeling approach of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) that is effective with incomplete, presence-only datasets to predict the distribution of the invasive island apple snail, Pomacea insularum. This freshwater snail is native to South America and has been spreading in the USA over the last decade from its initial introductions in Texas and Florida. It has now been documented throughout eight southeastern states. The snail's extensive consumption of aquatic vegetation and ability to accumulate and transmit algal toxins through the food web heighten concerns about its spread. Our model shows that under current climate conditions the snail should remain mostly confined to the coastal plain of the southeastern USA where it is limited by minimum temperature in the coldest month and precipitation in the warmest quarter. Furthermore, low pH waters (pH {\textless}5.5) are detrimental to the snail's survival and persistence. Of particular note are low-pH blackwater swamps, especially Okefenokee Swamp in southern Georgia (with a pH below 4 in many areas), which are predicted to preclude the snail's establishment even though many of these areas are well matched climatically. Our results elucidate the factors that affect the regional distribution of P. insularum, while simultaneously presenting a spatial basis for the prediction of its future spread. Furthermore, the model for this species exemplifies that combining climatic and habitat variables is a powerful way to model distributions of invasive species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Byers et al.},

Identification of environmental factors conducive to species range expansion for forecasting species distribution patterns will play a central role in devising management strategies to minimize the conflict between the agricultural productivity and biodiversity conservation. Here, we present results of a study that predicts the distribution of Indrella ampulla, a snail endemic to the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, which is becoming a pest in cardamom (Ellettaria cardamomum) plantations. We determined the distribution patterns and niche overlap between I.{\^{A}} ampulla and Ellettaria cardamomum using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) niche modeling techniques under current and future (2020–2080) climatic scenarios. The results showed that climatic (precipitation of coldest quarter and isothermality) and soil (cation exchange capacity of soil [CEC]) parameters are major factors that determine the distribution of I.{\^{A}} ampulla in Western Ghats. The model predicted cardamom cultivation areas in southern Western Ghats are highly sensitive to invasion of I.{\^{A}} ampulla under both present and future climatic conditions. While the land area in the central Western Ghats is predicted to become unsuitable for I.{\^{A}} ampulla and Ellettaria cardamomum in future, we found 71{\%} of the Western Ghats land area is suitable for Ellettaria cardamomum cultivation and 45{\%} suitable for I.{\^{A}} ampulla, with an overlap of 35{\%} between two species. The resulting distribution maps are invaluable for policy makers and conservation managers to design and implement management strategies minimizing the conflicts to sustain agricultural productivity while maintaining biodiversity in the region. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

To obtain the future potential geographic distributions, expressed as climatic niche suitability, we modeled the presences of these species using two IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) future emission scenarios of global climate change (A1B and B1), the Global Climate model CSIRO Mark 3.0, and three periods of future projections (years 2020, 2060, and 2080). After estimating with the MaxEnt software the future climatic niche suitability for each species, scenario, and period of future projections, we estimated a series of indexes of Venezuela's vulnerability at the county, state, and country level, measured as the number of people exposed due to the changes in the geographical distribution of the five triatomine species analyzed. Despite that this is not a measure of the risk of Chagas disease transmission, we conclude that possible future effects of global climate change on the Venezuelan population vulnerability show a slightly decreasing trend, even taking into account future population growth; we can expect fewer locations in Venezuela where an average Venezuelan citizen would be exposed to triatomines in the next 50-70 yr. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2015.

abstract = {The angular crab Goneplax rhomboides is native to the north-eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. It has rarely been reported from the North Sea, with no evidence of sustainable populations. Compiled survey data, however, revealed an increasing abundance of this species in the North Sea since 2000. The data were used to (1) describe the range expansion of the angular crab into the North Sea; and (2) to apply species distribution modeling (maximum entropy approach-MAXENT) to predict the potential habitats of this species. Habitats of species with a similar ecology were modeled to analyse habitat overlap and potential competition. The spatial and temporal patterns of records revealed that the expansion of the angular crab into the North Sea is due to natural larval dispersal rather than anthropogenic vectors. Modeled habitats of the angular crab showed a core distribution area along the Scottish coastline and in the southern North Sea. Sea bottom temperatures in February had the highest influence on the model results. We concluded that the angular crab has extended its distribution range from the north-eastern Atlantic to the North Sea, which was facilitated by an increase in water temperature and the prevailing hydrodynamics over the last decade. This was the first time that a benthic range expansion was observed in quasi real time for the North Sea. Habitats of the angular crab overlapped those of possible competitors to a large extent. However, co-existence of the species is expected rather than any negative effects resulting from the range expansion of the angular crab. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2013.},

The biased ensembles are characterised by non-zero currents and lack the time-reversal symmetry of the equilibrium state. In cases where the equilibrium system has an inversion symmetry which is broken by the bias, we show that the biased ensembles retain a generalised time-reversal symmetry, involving a spatial transformation that inverts the current. This means that these ensembles lack dissipation. Hence, they di.,-er significantly from non-equilibrium steady states where currents are induced by external forces. One consequence of this result is that maximum entropy assumptions (MaxEnt/MaxCal), widely used for modelling thermal systems away from equilibrium, have quite unexpected implications, including apparent superfluid behaviour in a classical model of shear flow. {\textcopyright} 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl.},

According to both models, the range for T. peregrinus will continue to expand. In South America and Africa, the distribution of the bronze bug may expand mainly to the north-east and central areas. Special attention should be given to the regions of southern U.S.A., Central America, and southern China and nearby countries, where conditions are highly suitable but the bronze bug has not yet been recorded and could only arrive by human means. Because Eucalyptus species, many of which are highly susceptible to infestation by the bronze bug, are increasingly being planted around the world, and because the bronze bug has spread so rapidly over the past 8years, the bronze bug may be expected to appear in many areas where it has not yet been recorded. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Royal Entomological Society.},

abstract = {Aim Invasive alien species are a growing threat to biodiversity, and identifying the mechanisms that enable these species to establish viable populations in their new environment is paramount for management of the problems they pose. Using an unusually large number of both failed and successful documented introductions of parakeets (Aves: Psittacidae) in Europe, we test two of the major hypotheses on the establishment success of invading species, namely the climate-matching and the human-activity hypothesis. Location European human population centres where ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri) and/or monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) introductions have occurred. Methods Data on ring-necked and monk parakeet introductions in Europe were gathered from various sources, including published books and articles, but also from unpublished reports and local grey literature. Information was verified with experts from the region under consideration. In order to test the climate-matching hypothesis, we verified whether the climatic factors that determine the parakeets' native ranges also explain establishment success in Europe. Parakeet occurrence data from the native ranges were analysed using the presence-only modelling method Maxent, and correlations between parakeet establishment and climatic and anthropogenic variables in Europe were assessed using both stepwise logistic regression and the information-theoretic model selection approach. Results The establishment success of ring-necked and monk parakeets was found to be positively associated with human population density, and, both in the native and in the introduced regions, parakeet occurrence was negatively correlated with the number of frost days. Thus, parakeets are more likely to establish in warmer and human-dominated areas. Main conclusions The large number of independent parakeet introductions in Europe allows us to test the often-used climate-matching and human-activity hypotheses at the species level. We show that both hypotheses offer insight into the invasion process of monk and ring-necked parakeets. Our results suggest that, in the future, parakeet establishment probability may increase even further because global warming is likely to cause a decrease in the number of frost days and because urbanization and human populations are still increasing. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Despite its status in Iran as a least concern species, dormice face high risk of extinction in some parts of Europe. The unique life history and large scale distribution of the species in the Palearctic region made it as an ideal model species. This habitat specialist rodent is particularly sensitive to size and connectivity of the forest patches. The fat dormouse shows very deep molecular and morphological divergence in its eastern most parts of its global distribution, in the Hyrcanian refugium of the Northern Iran. Therefore modeling its distributional range can leads to identify biodiversity hotspots and planning conservation activities. The meteorological data, land cover types, topographical variables and geo-referenced points representing geographical locations of the fat dormouse populations (latitude/longitude) in the study area were used as the primary MaxEnt model input data. The predictive accuracy of the Fat Dormouse ecological niche model was significant (training accuracy of 93.3{\%}). This approach successfully identified the areas of the fat dormouse presence across the study area.

abstract = {Aim: Understanding the factors determining the transition from introduction of aliens to the establishment of invasive populations is a critical issue of the study of biological invasions, and has key implications for management. Differences in fitness among areas of introduction can define the zones where aliens become invasive. The American slider turtle Trachemys scripta has been introduced worldwide, and has negative effects on freshwater communities, but only a subset of introduced populations breed successfully. We used species distribution models to assess the factors influencing the slider distribution in Italy, by analysing bioclimatic features that can cause the transition from presence of feral adults to breeding populations. We also evaluated whether climate change might increase the future suitability for reproduction. Location: Central and Northern Italy. Methods: The distribution of slider turtle was obtained from the literature, unpublished reports and field surveys. We used Maxent to build bioclimatic models. Results: Reproductive populations are associated to a clear bioclimatic envelope with warmer climate, more solar radiation and higher precipitations than populations where reproduction is not observed. Several Mediterranean areas currently have climatic features suitable for sliders. Scenarios of climate change predict the expansion of these areas. In the near future (2020), the proportion of populations in areas suitable for reproduction will dramatically increase. Main conclusion: Our study shows that bioclimatic differences can determine the areas where aliens become invaders. Management should be focused to these source areas. However, climate change can increase fitness in the future, and therefore the interactions between climate change and fitness can boost the invasiveness of this alien species. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {While glaciations constituted the major recent paleoclimatic event, inducing multiple oscillations on species' ranges, future and rapid shifts are expected if global warming predictions are confirmed. Investigating the whole temporal spectrum of range shifts is of conservation importance since species suffering contractions during the interglacial periods may continue contracting in a warming scenario; lizards provide excellent models for such analysis. We investigated the historical biogeography of Podarcis carbonelli, a lacertid lizard endemic to the Western Iberian Peninsula with a fragmented distribution, likely resulting from an important reduction during the Pleistocene and Holocene. We modelled with Maxent its current distribution and projected it to past (Last Interglacial-LIG and Last Glacial Maximum-LGM) and future (2020, 2050 and 2080) scenarios. The consensus models predicted a larger suitable area than the currently occupied, in areas with a high humidity and low maximum temperatures. The LIG model indicated a reduced range restricted to the northern Portuguese coast, and the LGM model, a suitable area larger than the current. After the LGM, areas with suitable climate started regression till present, which is predicted to continue in future, with a northward range shift and a loss of suitable climate from inland zones towards the coast. The range of P. carbonelli may have been oscillating from the northern Portuguese coast to the south and to inland during the Pleistocene. The Portuguese West Atlantic coast, harbouring a substantial part of the species' genetic diversity, with suitable climate during the LIG and LGM and forecasted to remain in the future, is not currently protected but deserves conservation priority. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Aim: Accurate spatial information on species occurrence is essential to address global change. Models for presence-only data are central to predicting species distributions because these represent the only geographical information available for many species. In this paper we introduce extensions to incorporate a variety of types of additional spatially explicit sources of information in Maxent and Poisson point process models. This spatial information comes from the output of other statistical or conceptual models. Innovation: Our approach relies on minimizing the relative (or cross) entropy (known as Minxent) between the predicted distribution and a prior distribution. In many scenarios, researchers have some additional information or expectations about the species distribution, such as outputs from previous models. Here, we show how to use this information to improve predictions of both niche models and spatial distributions, depending on what types of spatially explicit prior information is available and how it is incorporated in the model. Main conclusions: We illustrate applications of Minxent that include models for sampling bias, explicitly incorporating dispersal/other ecological processes, combining native and invasive range data, incorporating expert maps, and borrowing strength across taxonomic relatives. These applications focus on addressing biological scenarios where range modelling is extremely challenging – non-equilibrium species distributions and rare and narrowly distributed species – due to data limitations. When data are limited, we are typically forced to make informal assumptions or lean on predictions of other models in order to obtain useful predictions; our applications of Minxent provide a formal way of describing these assumptions and connections to other models. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

The pest originates from South and Southeast Asia, but has expanded its range dramatically since the 1980s. We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) approaches to explore its likely geographic potential. Two techniques, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) and a maximum entropy approach (MaxEnt), were used. However, MaxEnt provided more significant results, with all 5 random replicate subsamples having P {\textless} 0.002 while GARP models failed to achieve statistical significance in 3 of 5 cases, in which predictions achieved probabilities of 0.07 {\textless} P {\textless} 0.10. The MaxEnt models predicted successfully the known distribution, including the single North American occurrence point of Laguna Beach, California, and various areas where the pest has been reported in North Africa, southern Europe, Middle East and South and Southeastern Asia. In addition, areas where the pest has not been yet reported were found to be suitable for invasion by RPW in sub-Saharan Africa, southern, central and northern America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Highly suitable areas in the United States of America were limited mostly to coastal California and southern Florida, while all Caribbean islands were found highly suitable for establishment and spread of the pest.},

Here, we study the distribution of this important species and expected consequences of climate change upon it, using correlative species distribution modeling and publicly available presence-only data. As experience with SDM is scarce for marine phytoplankton, this also serves as a pilot study for this organism group. We used the maximum entropy method to calculate distribution models for the diatom F. kerguelensis based on yearly and monthly environmental data (sea surface temperature, salinity, nitrate and silicate concentrations). Observation data were harvested from GBIF and the Global Diatom Database, and for further analyses also from the Hustedt Diatom Collection (BRM). The models were projected on current yearly and seasonal environmental data to study current distribution and its seasonality. Furthermore, we projected the seasonal model on future environmental data obtained from climate models for the year 2100. Projected on current yearly averaged environmental data, all models showed similar distribution patterns for F. kerguelensis. The monthly model showed seasonality, for example, a shift of the southern distribution boundary toward the north in the winter. Projections on future scenarios resulted in a moderately to negligibly shrinking distribution area and a change in seasonality. We found a substantial bias in the publicly available observation datasets, which could be reduced by additional observation records we obtained from the Hustedt Diatom Collection. Present-day distribution patterns inferred from the models coincided well with background knowledge and previous reports about F. kerguelensis distribution, showing that maximum entropy-based distribution models are suitable to map distribution patterns for oceanic planktonic organisms. Our scenario projections indicate moderate effects of climate change upon the biogeography of F. kerguelensis. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Multiple anthropogenic threats have caused vulture populations to decline globally, with serious ecological and socio-economic implications. The Cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres) has declined throughout its range in southern Africa, recently being listed as extinct as a breeding species in Namibia. It has been suggested that climate change might have contributed to the decline of Cape vultures in northern parts of the range. To provide a first assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on the occurrence of Cape vultures, a presence-only environmental niche modelling method (Maxent) was used to predict the spatial occurrence patterns of wild vultures fitted with GPS tracking units in northern Namibia and northern South Africa, under current and future climatic conditions. The models showed high predictive power (AUC {\textgreater} 0.868 ± 0.006), with precipitation seasonality identified as the most important variable for predicting Cape vulture presence. Of the area estimated to be suitable for Cape vultures under current conditions, 28–55{\%} was predicted to become unsuitable under future climate conditions, with a pole-ward shift in the mean centre of the range of 151–333 km and significant range loss from the former breeding range in north-central Namibia and the core breeding range in northern South Africa. The total area of suitable range was predicted to increase in the future due to modelled expansions into grassland and cropland areas where the species has been absent historically. The coverage of suitable areas by protected areas was predicted to decrease from 5.8–7.9{\%} to 2.8–3.8{\%}, suggesting that private land will become increasingly important for Cape vulture conservation. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Species distribution modelling was assessed by using MaxEnt software combined with geographical information systems (GIS) to predict suitable larval habitats for these two vectors and develop potential risk maps that can be used for their targeted control. Climate and topographical data layers from Worldclim and larval occurrence records were used to model these two vectors. The results showed that suitable habitats of St. aegypti are widely distributed only in the central region and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus were in the central and southwestern parts of Al-Bahah Province. The highest predictive power was shown by topographical variables in St. aegypti modeling and the minor contributions were shown by precipitation and temperature related variables. The maximum contribution was shown by temperature related variables and minor contribution was shown by topographical and precipitation related variables in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus modeling.

abstract = {Studies that model the effect of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems often use climate projections from downscaled global climate models (GCMs). These simulations are generally too coarse to capture patterns of fine-scale climate variation, such as the sharp coastal energy and moisture gradients associated with wind-driven upwelling of cold water. Coastal upwelling may limit future increases in coastal temperatures, compromising GCMs' ability to provide realistic scenarios of future climate in these coastal ecosystems. Taking advantage of naturally occurring variability in the high-resolution historic climatic record, we developed multiple fine-scale scenarios of California climate that maintain coherent relationships between regional climate and coastal upwelling. We compared these scenarios against coarse resolution GCM projections at a regional scale to evaluate their temporal equivalency. We used these historically based scenarios to estimate potential suitable habitat for coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens D. Don) under 'normal' combinations of temperature and precipitation, and under anomalous combinations representative of potential future climates. We found that a scenario of warmer temperature with historically normal precipitation is equivalent to climate projected by GCMs for California by 2020-2030 and that under these conditions, climatically suitable habitat for coast redwood significantly contracts at the southern end of its current range. Our results suggest that historical climate data provide a high-resolution alternative to downscaled GCM outputs for near-term ecological forecasts. This method may be particularly useful in other regions where local climate is strongly influenced by ocean-atmosphere dynamics that are not represented by coarse-scale GCMs. {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

In this paper we review and update the distribution of three species of Lycaenid butterflies in Andalusia (southern Spain): Cupido carswelli, C. lorquinii, and C. osiris. Cupido carswelli is endemic in south east Spain and is considered a vulnerable species in the Red Book of Invertebrates of Andalusia. Cupido lorquinii is an Iberian-Maghrebian endemism, found in the southern half of the Iberian peninsula. Cupido osiris, widely distributed in Europe and Central Asia, has its southern limit of distribution in Andalusia. We modeled the potential current distribution of these species in Andalusia, using Maxent. Their potential distribution was mainly conditioned by the presence of their host plants and, to a lesser extent, by climatic variables: rainfall during the warmest and coldest quarters of the year and annual mean temperature. AUC test values, sensitivity, and specificity for the three models were high, confirming the accuracy of the models and their high predictive values. We also modeled the potential future distributions of the three species under the climate change scenario A2a. Our results predict a significant reduction in the potential distribution for C. lorquinii —which has a wider distribution in Andalusia than the other two species— and for the more localized species, C. osiris and C. carswelli. This expected decline in the south of the Iberian peninsula highlights the pressing need to design and implement specific conservation plans for these species. {\textcopyright} 2016 Museu de Ci{\`{e}}ncies Naturals de Barcelona.},

Our study focused on the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), western pine beetle (Dendroctonus brevicomis), and pine engraver (Ips pini). This study was conducted across eight states in the Interior West of the US covering approximately 2.2millionkm2 and encompassing about 95{\%} of the Rocky Mountains in the contiguous US. Our analyses relied on aerial surveys of bark beetle outbreaks that occurred between 1991 and 2008. Occurrence points for each species were generated within polygons created from the aerial surveys. Current and projected climate scenarios were acquired from the WorldClim database and represented by 19 bioclimatic variables. We used Maxent modeling technique fit with occurrence points and current climate data to model potential beetle distributions and forest vulnerability. Three available climate models, each having two emission scenarios, were modeled independently and results averaged to produce two predictions for 2020 and two predictions for 2050 for each analysis. Environmental parameters defined by current climate models were then used to predict conditions under future climate scenarios, and changes in different species' ranges were calculated. Our results suggested that the potential distribution for bark beetles under current climate conditions is extensive, which coincides with infestation trends observed in the last decade. Our results predicted that suitable habitats for the mountain pine beetle and pine engraver beetle will stabilize or decrease under future climate conditions, while habitat for the western pine beetle will continue to increase over time. The greatest increase in habitat area was for the western pine beetle, where one climate model predicted a 27{\%} increase by 2050. In contrast, the predicted habitat of the mountain pine beetle from another climate model suggested a decrease in habitat areas as great as 46{\%} by 2050. Generally, 2020 and 2050 models that tested the three climate scenarios independently had similar trends, though one climate scenario for the western pine beetle produced contrasting results. Ranges for all three species of bark beetles shifted considerably geographically suggesting that some host species may become more vulnerable to beetle attack in the future, while others may have a reduced risk over time. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Biogeographic trends of endemic and subendemic flora in the western Iberian Peninsula under scenarios of future climate changes. Lazaroa 35: 19-35 (2014). Altitude, temperature and precipitation are important environmental variables for the distribution of endemic plants. Taking in account their present distribution, this work studies the distribution trends of 116 endemic and subendemic species that occur on the western Iberian Peninsula and north-western Morocco, in different scenarios of future climate change. It was possible to identify five groups of taxa in the present environmental conditions, four of which for the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula. This range can partially be explained by the altitudinal variability of such area. The other group distributes along the western of the Iberian Peninsula. Concerning future climate change scenarios, important changes in species distribution, and a general south-north trend were obtained. Under harsher climatic changes, only the groups that tolerate the most variable environmental conditions persist. Estimates of extinction rates of the studied taxa for the next 75 years are also presented. The present methodology allows the application of ecological indicators (environmental groups, in this case) to understand biogeographic trends.},

abstract = {Crisis-affected populations are often able to maintain digital communications but in a sudden-onset crisis any aid organizations will have the least free resources to process such communications. Information that aid agencies can actually act on, 'actionable' information, will be sparse so there is great potential to (semi)automatically identify actionable communications. However, there are hurdles as the languages spoken will often be under resourced, have orthographic variation, and the precise definition of 'actionable' will be response-specific and evolving. We present a novel system that addresses this, drawing on 40,000 emergency text messages sent in Haiti following the January 12, 2010 earthquake, predominantly in Haitian Kreyol. We show that keyword/ngram-based models using streaming MaxEnt achieve up to F=0.21 accuracy. Further, we find current state-of the-art sub word models increase this substantially to F=0.33 accuracy, while modeling the spatial, temporal, topic and source contexts of the messages can increase this to a very accurate F=0.86 over direct text messages and F=0.90-0.97 over social media, making it a viable strategy for message prioritization. {\textcopyright} 2011 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

abstract = {Species distribution Models (SDMs) illustrate the relation between species and environmental variables. In an attempt to model the historical and current distribution of Lesser Adjutant Stork (Leptoptilos javanicus) and gain qualitative insight into range shift, maxEnt modeling approach was applied. The model was projected into maps to illustrate the variation in spatial distribution of the species in South and Southeast Asia over time. A distributional shift was observed towards the north accompanied by range contraction to the south and expansion to the north. Besides, annual precipitation and temperature of the coldest period of a year appeared to be the major climatic determinants of species distribution. It provides plausible evidence of global climate and land-use change effect on the bird's distribution and suggests avenues for further research. {\textcopyright} 2014 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract = {Maximum entropy (maxent) models assign probabilities to states that (1) agree with measured macroscopic constraints on attributes of the states and (2) are otherwise maximally uninformative and are thus as close as possible to a specified prior distribution. Such models have recently become popular in ecology, but classical inferential statistical tests require assumptions of independence during the allocation of entities to states that are rarely fulfilled in ecology. This paper describes a new permutation test for such maxent models that is appropriate for very general prior distributions and for cases in which many states have zero abundance and that can be used to test for conditional relevance of subsets of constraints. Simulations show that the test gives correct probability estimates under the null hypothesis. Power under the alternative hypothesis depends primarily on the number and strength of the constraints and on the number of states in the model; the number of empty states has only a small effect on power. The test is illustrated using two empirical data sets to test the community assembly model of B. Shipley, D. Vile, and E. Garnier and the species abundance distribution models of S. Pueyo, F. He, and T. Zillio. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {During the winter months, from June to September, humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae breed and calve in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) after migrating north from Antarctic waters. Clearly defined wintering areas for breeding and calving comparable to those identified in other parts of the world have not yet been identified for humpback whales in the GBR Marine Park (GBRMP), mainly because of its large size, which prohibits broad-scale surveys. To identify important wintering areas in the GBRMP, we developed a predictive spatial habitat model using the Maxent modelling method and presence-only sighting data from nondedicated aerial surveys. The model was further validated using a small independent satellite tag data set of 12 whales migrating north into the GBR. The model identified restricted ranges in water depth (30 to 58 m, highest probability 49 m) and sea surface temperature (21 to 23°C, highest probability 21.8°C) and identified 2 core areas of higher probability of whale occurrence in the GBRMP, which correspond well with the movements of satellite tagged whales. We propose that one of the identified core areas is a potentially important wintering area for humpback whales and the other a migration route. With an estimated increase in port and coastal development and shipping activity in the GBRMP and a rapidly increasing population of whales recovering from whaling off the east Australian coast, the rate of human interactions with whales is likely to increase. Identifying important areas for breeding and calving is essential for the future management of human interactions with breeding humpback whales. {\textcopyright} 2012 Inter-Research.},

abstract = {Aim We evaluated Odonata distribution data and predicted the compositional resemblance based on niche-based species distribution models to analyse the following questions: (1) How is estimated species richness distributed, and how can it be preserved under the actual network of conservation units (a gap analysis approach)? (2) How is the estimated odonate beta diversity distributed, and is there a better distribution of conservation units (a priority setting approach)? (3) Is the probability of being under protection a function of the potential species range size? and (4) Will the current conservation network proposals protect odonate taxa? Location Central Brazil in a core Cerrado area. Methods We generated odonate species distribution predictions based on MaxEnt and maps derived from estimated species richness, beta diversity and gap analysis for all species predicted to occur in the study area. Then, we compared these maps with current conservation units, land-use patterns and proposals for the establishment of conservation units. Results Raw odonate species records provided limited utility for setting conservation priorities without the use of niche-based models. However, area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) values were characterized by substantial variation that was related to the number of records. No current conservation units overlapped the areas with higher predicted richness and beta diversity, and in general, conservation units were not preserving restricted/rare species. There was a direct linear correlation between species range size and the proportion of its range protected in the current network of conservation units. Finally, we identified three areas with high odonate beta diversity where conservationist actions should be implemented. Main conclusions Current conservation units and future suggested areas do not overlap regions with high conservation values for odonates. Conservation units protect species at random, and the level of protection has a direct relationship with species range size; thus, wide-range species are expected to be more protected than restricted or threatened species. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {For the study of the macroecology and conservation of Taiwan's birds, there was an urgent need to develop distribution models of bird species whose distribution had never before been modeled. Therefore, we here model the distributions of 27 mostly rare and cryptic breeding bird species using a statistical approach which has been shown to be especially reliable for modeling species with a low sample size of presence localities, namely the maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling technique. For this purpose, we began with a dedicated attempt to collate as much high-quality distributional data as possible, assembling databases from several scientific reports, contacting individual data recorders and searching publicly accessible database, the internet and the available literature. This effort resulted in 2022 grid cells of 1 × 1 km size being associated with a presence record for one of the 27 species. These records and 10 pre-selected environmental variables were then used to model each species' probability distribution which we show here with all grid cells below the lowest presence threshold being converted to zeros. We then in detail discuss the interpretation and applicability of these distributions, whereby we pay close attention to habitat requirements, the intactness and fragmentation of their habitat, the general detectability of the species and data reliability. This study is another one in an ongoing series of studies which highlight the usefulness of using large electronic databases and modern analytical methods to help with the monitoring and assessment of Taiwan's bird species.},

abstract = {Aim: Maps of species richness are the basis for applied research and conservation planning as well as for theoretical research investigating patterns of richness and the processes shaping these patterns. The method used to create a richness map could influence the results of such studies, but differences between these methods have been insufficiently evaluated. We investigate how different methods of mapping species ranges can influence patterns of richness, at three spatial resolutions. Location: California, USA. Methods: We created richness maps by overlaying individual species range maps for terrestrial amphibians and reptiles. The methods we used to create ranges included: point-to-grid maps, obtained by overlaying point observations of species occurrences with a grid and determining presence or absence for each cell; expert-drawn maps; and maps obtained through species distribution modelling. We also used a hybrid method that incorporated data from all three methods. We assessed the correlation and similarity of the spatial patterns of richness maps created with each of these four methods at three different resolutions. Results: Richness maps created with different methods were more correlated at lower spatial resolutions than at higher resolutions. At all resolutions, point-to-grid richness maps estimated the lowest species richness and those derived from species distribution models the highest. Expert-drawn maps and hybrid maps showed intermediate levels of richness but had different spatial patterns of species richness from those derived with the other methods. Main conclusions: Even in relatively well-studied areas such as California, different data sources can lead to rather dissimilar maps of species richness. Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of different methods for creating a richness map can provide guidance for selecting the approach that is most appropriate for a given application and region. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The ability of remote sensing to represent ecologically relevant features at multiple spatial scales makes it a powerful tool for studying wildlife distributions. Species of varying sizes perceive and interact with their environment at differing scales; therefore, it is important to consider the role of spatial resolution of remotely sensed data in the creation of distribution models. The release of the Globeland30 land cover classification in 2014, with its 30 m resolution, presents the opportunity to do precisely that. We created a series of Maximum Entropy distribution models for African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) using Globeland30 data analyzed at varying resolutions. We compared these with similarly re-sampled models created from the European Space Agency's Global Land Cover Map (Globcover). These data, in combination with GIS layers of topography and distance to roads, human activity, and water, as well as elephant GPS collar data, were used with MaxEnt software to produce the final distribution models. The AUC (Area Under the Curve) scores indicated that the models created from 600 m data performed better than other spatial resolutions and that the Globeland30 models generally performed better than the Globcover models. Additionally, elevation and distance to rivers seemed to be the most important variables in our models. Our results demonstrate that Globeland30 is a valid alternative to the well-established Globcover for creating wildlife distribution models. It may even be superior for applications which require higher spatial resolution and less nuanced classifications.},

abstract = {Insect pests pose a great threat to global food security. Improved methods for assessment of the risk of pest establishment are needed to enhance informed decision-making, to develop cost-effective pest management strategies, and to design quarantine policies for preventing the spread of pests. We evaluated the capabilities of a correlative and a process-based mechanistic niche model, and their combination, to assess the risk of pest establishment. The correlative model MaxEnt and the process-based mechanistic model CLIMEX were used to assess the risk of establishment of western cherry fruit fly, Rhagoletis indifferens Curran (Diptera: Tephritidae) in California. We integrated R. indifferens occurrence records and spatial environmental variables using MaxEnt to assess the potential risk of establishment of this pest. The CLIMEX model was developed using eco-physiological tolerances of R. indifferens. The predictive performance of the MaxEnt model improved by including the host species' distribution and Ecoclimatic Index generated using the CLIMEX model. The best model predicted no risk for R. indifferens establishment in the Central Valley around the areas where sweet cherries are produced in California. Most of the high to very high risk areas for R. indifferens were predicted in northern parts of California and the Sierra Nevada Mountains, where the fly exists on its native host, bitter cherry [Prunus emarginata (Douglas) Eaton]. Precipitation of driest quarter, degree days with average temperatures -8.38C, degree days with average temperatures -58C, and mean diurnal range in temperature were the strongest predictors of R. indifferens distribution in western North America. We showed that the predictive power of correlative niche models can be improved by including outputs from the process-based mechanistic niche models. Overall results suggest that R. indifferens is unlikely to establish in the commercial cherry-growing areas in the Central Valley of California, largely because heat stress is too high and chilling requirement in those areas is not met.

abstract = {The Red List classification of IUCN has become one of the most important evaluations of threats that affect biodiversity at the species level. However, many estimations of species range, one essential factor in the Red List classification, are derived from expert-based assessments that sometimes lack empirical evidence. Our study focused on the corncrake (Crex crex), a grassland Palaearctic bird whose conservation status has been revised recently following some new assessments of range and population size. However, the amount of data that form the basis of this reclassification appears weak compared to the large area involved. We used a method of species distribution modelling (MAXENT) to predict the corncrake range and confronted it to the expert-based map. We resolved the huge geographic bias in the distribution of presence points by using a relevant method of sampling bias correction. We found a rather similar distribution with the IUCN estimated range, although less widespread. We also highlighted a relationship between habitat suitability computed by the model and population estimates per country when the effect of agriculture intensity is taken into account. This result supports the current expert-based estimates of corncrake distribution and emphasizes that a relevant modelling strategy should be able to predict the distribution of a species even from a biased dataset. IUCN estimates of species' ranges would certainly benefit from a model-based approach in addition to expert and field controls. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases can have serious consequences for wildlife populations, ecosystem structure and biodiversity. Predicting the spatial patterns and potential impacts of diseases in free-ranging wildlife are therefore important for planning, prioritizing and implementing research and management actions. 2.We developed spatial models of environmental suitability (ES) for infection with the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the most significant disease affecting vertebrate biodiversity on record, amphibian chytridiomycosis. We applied relatively newly developed methods for modelling ES (Maxent) to the first comprehensive, continent-wide data base (comprising {\textgreater}10000 observations) on the occurrence of infection with this pathogen and employed novel methodologies to deal with common but rarely addressed sources of model uncertainty. 3.We used ES to (i) predict the minimum potential geographic distribution of infection with B. dendrobatidis in Australia and (ii) test the hypothesis that ES for B. dendrobatidis should help explain patterns of amphibian decline given its theoretical and empirical link with organism abundance (intensity of infection), a known determinant of disease severity. 4.We show that (i) infection with B. dendrobatidis has probably reached its broad geographic limits in Australia under current climatic conditions but that smaller areas of invasion potential remain, (ii) areas of high predicted ES for B. dendrobatidis accurately reflect areas where population declines due to severe chytridiomycosis have occurred and (iii) that a host-specific metric of ES for B. dendrobatidis (ES for Bdspecies) is the strongest predictor of decline in Australian amphibians at a continental scale yet discovered. 5.Synthesis and applications. Our results provide quantitative information that helps to explain both the spatial distribution and potential effects (risk) of amphibian infection with B. dendrobatidis at the population level. Given scarce conservation resources, our results can be used immediately in Australia and our methods applied elsewhere to prioritize species, regions and actions in the struggle to limit further biodiversity loss. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) assume equilibrium between species' distribution and the environment. However, this assumption can be violated under restricted dispersal and spatially autocorrelated environmental conditions. Here we used a model to simulate species' ranges expansion under two non-equilibrium scenarios, evaluating the performance of SDM coupled with spatial eigenvector mapping. The highest fit is for the models that include space, although the relative importance of spatial variables during the range expansion differs in the two scenarios. Incorporating space to the models was important only under colonization-lag non-equilibrium, under the expected scenario. Thus, mechanisms that generate range cohesion and determine species' distribution under climate changes can be captured by spatial modelling, with advantages compared with other techniques and in line with recent claims that SDMs have to account for more complex dynamic scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Royal Society.},

I analyzed the historical and geographical occurrence of Dromiciops gliroides, a marsupial endemic to the temperate rain forests of southern Chile and Argentina and the sole living representative of the order Microbiotheria. Eighty-eight localities spanning 7°31′ latitude (∼850 km) and 3°13′ longitude (∼350 km) are known for the species and were taken from previous works and museum specimens and integrated in a geographic information system. Species distribution was analyzed in a historical, geographic, and biogeographic context, with the use of maps at different scales (region, subregion, province, ecoregion, and forest type). The software MaxEnt was used to generate 2 potential distribution models with environmental data. Generated models show a northern contraction and southern expansion in the species' potential distribution, with variation in habitat suitability throughout the current species range. Precipitation and some temperature-related variables influenced both generated models. The species' occurrence lies within the Andean region; Subantarctic and Patagonia subregions; and Maule, Valdivian, and Subandean Patagonia provinces. At a smaller scale, most of the localities occur within the Valdivian Temperate Forests ecoregion, and in the majority of the forest types described for it, implying broader ecological requirements than expected. Identification of critical areas through potential distribution modeling may have implications on species conservation and biogeographic patterns. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Society of Mammalogists.},

Contributing to the management program, this study aimed to predict the distribution of two threatened medicinal plants, Fritillaria cirrhosa and Lilium nepalense. The location of focal species gathered from herbarium specimen housed in different herbaria and online databases were geo-referenced and checked for spatial autocorrelation. The predictive environmental variables were selected, and MaxEnt software was used to model the current and future distributions of focal species. Four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) trajectories of the BCC-CSM1.1 model were used as the future (2050) projection layer. The MaxEnt modelling delineated the potential distribution of F. cirrhosa and L. nepalense. The current suitability is projected towards Central and Eastern Hilly/Mountainous regions. Both species gain maximum suitability in RCP 4.5 which decline towards other trajectories for L. nepalense. Overall, both the focal species shift towards the north-west, losing their potential habitat in hilly and lower mountainous regions by 2050 across all trajectories. Our results highlight the impact of future climate change on two threatened and valuable species. The results can be further useful to initiate farming of these medicinally and economically important species based on climatically suitable zone and for designing a germplasm conservation strategy. {\textcopyright} 2017, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Aim: We combined genetic sequence data and ecological niche modelling to resolve the impacts of past climatic fluctuations on the distribution, genetic diversification, and demographic dynamics of an East Asian montane bird, the green-backed tit (Parus monticolus). Location: East Asia. Methods: Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using four mitochondrial fragments and seven nuclear loci from 161 birds sampled from 29 localities spanning the entire geographical range of the green-backed tit. We used *beast to estimate the species tree and calculate divergence times. Extended Bayesian skyline plots were used to infer potential historical shifts in population size. We used MaxEnt to predict potential distributions during three periods: the present day, the Last Glacial Maximum and the Last Interglacial. Results: The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene tree showed strong support for three reciprocally monophyletic groups: a south-western clade, a central clade and a Taiwanese clade. Taiwanese and Vietnamese samples had fixed differences at several nuclear loci, but the south-western and central samples shared haplotypes at all nuclear loci. The mtDNA gene tree topology differed from the species tree topology. The species tree suggested sister relationships between Taiwanese and Vietnamese operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and between south-western and central OTUs. Diversification within the green-backed tit was relatively recent, probably within the last 0.9 million years. Extended Bayesian skyline plots suggested rapid population expansion in the south-western and central phylogroups after the Last Interglacial, and this result was consistent with ecological niche models. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that genetic diversification within the green-backed tit was affected by the later Pleistocene climate fluctuations. Ecological niche models indicated that the present-day vegetation distribution was, in many ways, more similar to that of the Last Glacial Maximum than it was to that of the Last Interglacial. Continental populations of the green-backed tit experienced unusual demographic and range expansion that is likely to have occurred during the cooling transition between the Last Interglacial and the Last Glacial Maximum. We found incongruence between the mtDNA gene tree and the species tree, which underscores the importance of using both mitochondrial and nuclear markers when estimating the evolutionary history of populations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Rotan Perccottus glenii is one of the most widespread alien invasive freshwater fish in Eurasia. We reviewed the mechanisms of its dispersion, identified the potential range and regarded these results in the light of possible prevention of further expansion. Our analysis was based on 970 presence records and 198 absence records from both invaded and native parts of the range. Since 1916 invasion dynamics of rotan have been driven by episodic anthropogenic translocations, followed by spontaneous expansion within river networks, and secondary translocations. Maxent species distribution models with independent validations showed that rotan distribution in Eurasia has climatic limitations; rotan have already invaded most areas with high climatic suitability in the Palearctic, but some regions of North Eurasia and North America, where rotan is currently absent, have high climatic suitability and may be vulnerable to invasion in the future. Rotan's high invasiveness, lack of geographical barriers and absence of reliable methods to prevent spread present a very high risk of expansion within appropriate climate limits in Europe. Our analysis shows that the long-term invasion dynamics of an invasive freshwater species may depend on climate variables rather than on river basin borders. Species distribution models, based on large scale environmental layers, can be useful to understand the invasion risk for other freshwater species restricted to shallow aquatic habitats. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

These species are distributed allopatrically, but the ecological traits that determine their distributions remain largely unknown and their phylogenetic relationships are unclear. We used species distribution models (SDMs) to identify variables explaining their distribution patterns and test hypotheses about ecological divergence and conservatism based on niche overlap analysis. For Rusty-barred Owls and Chaco Owls, climatic factors related to temperature played a major role, whereas a rainfall variable was more important for Rufous-legged Owls. When niche overlaps were compared, accounting for regional similarities in the habitat available to each species, an ecological niche divergence process was supported for Chaco Owl-Rusty-barred Owl and Chaco Owl-Rufous-legged Owl, whereas a niche conservatism process was supported for Rusty-barred Owl-Rufous-legged Owl. Different ecological requirements support current species delimitation, but they are in disagreement with the two main hypotheses currently envisaged about their phylogenetic relationships (Chaco Owls as the sister taxa of either Rufous-legged Owls or Rusty-barred Owls) and support a new phylogenetic hypothesis (Rufous-legged Owls as sister taxa of Rusty-barred Owls). Our findings suggest that speciation of Rusty-barred Owls and Rufous-legged Owls was a vicariant event resulting from Atlantic marine transgressions in southern South America in the Miocene, but their niche was conserved because habitat changed little in their respective ranges. In contrast, Chaco Owls diverged ecologically from the other two species as a result of their adaptations to the habitat they currently occupy. Ecological and historical approaches in biogeography can be embedded to explain distribution patterns, and results provided by SDMs can be used to infer historical and ecological processes in an integrative way. {\textcopyright} 2017 Association of Field Ornithologists},

The southern smooth snake (Coronella girondica) is likely the most elusive snake species of penin-sular Italy, and is therefore well-suited for predicting potential distribution studies. In this paper we predict the potential distribution map of this species in Italy by using MAXENT algorithm, that finds the probability distribution of maximum entropy that is constrained by considered ecological parameters. Presence data for Coronella girondica were gotten from CKmap. The potential distribution model of Coronella girondica showed a very good overall performance (AUC = 0.959), and indicated that high suitability areas correspond mainly to Tyrrhenian north and central regions, including Liguria, western Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Umbria, and northern Latium. Southern Italian regions were clearly unsuitable for this snake species. Overall, our study revealed that previous distribution maps indicating the occurrence of Coronella girondica in southern Italy and Sicily were poorly reliable. The conservation and management implications of our study are also addressed.},

abstract = {Aim: Climate change is currently altering the geographical distribution of species, but how this process contributes to biogeographical variation in ecological traits is unknown. Range-shifting species are predicted to encounter and respond to new selective regimes during their expansion phase, but also carry historical adaptations to their ancestral range. We sought to identify how historical and novel components of the environment interact to shape latitudinal trends in thermal tolerance, thermal tolerance breadth and phenotypic plasticity of a range-shifting species. Location: Southern and central Sweden. Methods: To evaluate phenotypic responses to changes in the thermal selective environment, we experimentally determined the upper and lower thermal tolerances of {\textgreater} 2000 wild-caught damselflies (Ischnura elegans) from populations distributed across core and expanding range-edge regions. We then identified changing correlations between thermal tolerance, climate and recent weather events across the range expansion. Niche modelling was employed to evaluate the relative contributions of varying climatic selective regimes to overall habitat suitability for the species in core versus range-edge regions. Results: Upper thermal tolerance exhibited local adaptation to climate in the core region, but showed evidence of having been released from thermal selection during the current range expansion. In contrast, chill coma recovery exhibited local adaptation across the core region and range expansion, corresponding to increased climatic variability at higher latitudes. Adaptive plasticity of lower thermal tolerances (acclimation ability) increased towards the northern, expanding range edge. Main conclusions: Our results suggest micro-evolutionary mechanisms for several large-scale and general biogeographical patterns, including spatially and latitudinally invariant heat tolerances (Brett's rule) and increased thermal acclimation rates and niche breadths at higher latitudes. Population-level processes unique to climate-mediated range expansions may commonly underpin many broader, macro-physiological trends. {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

Effectively balancing these objectives requires data about how use is distributed within areas of interest and how management strategies and environmental conditions interact to minimize negative impacts. This study examined which environmental and managerial factors most influenced the distribution of domestic pack stock animals, a common visitor use-related activity, when released to graze in high elevation meadows. Using a species distribution modelling approach, MaxEnt, managerial factors were found to be among the top contributors to models. Pack stock animals concentrated use near the locations where they were released as well as portable enclosure fencing confining the lead animal even though the remainder were allowed to roam freely. Elevation was the environmental factor contributing most, with animals remaining at similar elevations to the meadow even if moving into nearby understory. Results highlight the importance of release point and fence locations to overall pack stock animal distribution and rotational or strategic placement can be a tactic for mitigating impacts to sensitive habitats. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

We began by using a combination of species distribution models (SDMs) and geographic information system (GIS) tools to generate species richness maps of medicinal plants in northeast China. First, we conducted a detailed investigation of 2884 study plots in northeast China and selected 49 medicinal plant species for further analysis. The field surveys performed for this study spanned four years and identified a large number of new populations of medicinal plants in the forests of northeast China. We modeled and mapped the potential distributions of these 49 species and found that species richness hotspots are concentrated in the eastern and northeastern areas of the study region. We then analyzed the results of jackknife tests and found that the most important environmental variables on medicinal plant distribution are related to precipitation. Finally, we used the geographic distribution of medicinal plant richness to evaluate the ability of existing Nature Reserves to conserve these plants. By acquiring model data and using SDM and GIS to evaluate the current distribution and richness of medicinal plants, we are able to evaluate their current protection status and make recommendations about their utilization. This analysis could be expanded to assess medicinal plant populations in other regions where there are adequate records of the current distribution of medicinal plants. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Maps of surficial sediment distribution and benthic habitats or biotopes provide invaluable information for ocean management and are at the core of many seabed mapping initiatives, including Norway's national offshore mapping programme MAREANO (www.mareano.no). Access to high-quality multibeam echosounder data (bathymetry and backscatter) has been central to many of MAREANO's mapping activities, but in order to maximize the cost-effectiveness of future mapping and ensure timely delivery of scientific information, seabed mappers worldwide may increasingly need to look to existing bathymetry data as a basis for thematic maps. This study examines the potential of compiled single-beam bathymetry data for sediment and biotope mapping. We simulate a mapping scenario where full coverage multibeam data are not available, but where existing bathymetry datasets are supplemented by limited multibeam data to provide the basis for thematic map interpretation and modelling. Encouraging results of sediment interpretation from the compiled bathymetry dataset suggest that production of sediment grain size distribution maps is feasible at a 1:250 000 scale or coarser, depending on the quality of available data. Biotope modelling made use of full-coverage predictor variables based on (i) multibeam data, and (ii) compiled single-beam data supplemented by limited multibeam data. Using the same response variable (biotope point observations obtained from video data), the performance of the respective models could be assessed. Biotope distribution maps based on the two datasets are visually similar, and performance statistics also indicate there is little difference between the models, providing a comparable level of information for regional management purposes. However, whilst our results suggest that using compiled bathymetry data with limited multibeam is viable as a basis for regional sediment and biotope mapping, it is not a substitute. Backscatter data and the better feature resolution provided by multibeam data remain of great value for these and other purposes. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Council for the Exploration of the Seas 2013.},

abstract = {Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a parasitic infection (also called kala-azar in South Asia) caused by Leishmania donovani that is a considerable threat to public health in the Indian subcontinent, including densely populated Bangladesh. The disease seriously affects the poorest subset of the population in the subcontinent. Despite the fact that the incidence of VL results in significant morbidity and mortality, its environmental determinants are relatively poorly understood, especially in Bangladesh. In this study, we have extracted a number of environmental variables obtained from a range of sources, along with human VL cases collected through several field visits, to model the distribution of disease which may then be used as a surrogate for determining the distribution of Phlebotomus argentipes vector, in hyperendemic and endemic areas of Mymensingh and Gazipur districts in Bangladesh. The analysis was carried out within an ecological niche model (ENM) framework using a maxent to explore the ecological requirements of the disease. Results: The results suggest that VL in the study area can be predicted by precipitation during the warmest quarter of the year, land surface temperature (LST), and normalized difference water index (NDWI). As P. argentipes is the single proven vector of L. donovani in the study area, its distribution could reasonably be determined by the same environmental variables. The analysis further showed that the majority of VL cases were located in mauzas where the estimated probability of the disease occurrence was high. This may reflect the potential distribution of the disease and consequently P. argentipes in the study area. Conclusions: The results of this study are expected to have important implications, particularly in vector control strategies and management of risk associated with this disease. Public health officials can use the results to prioritize their visits in specific areas. Further, the findings can be used as a baseline to model how the distribution of the disease caused by P. argentipes might change in the event of climatic and environmental changes that resulted from increased anthropogenic activities in Bangladesh and elsewhere. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s).},

Without better information on the distribution and habitat preference of key species, a complete understanding of the ecology of deep-sea communities will remain unattainable. It is increasingly apparent that cold-water corals are among the dominant foundation species in the deep sea, providing both structurally complex habitat and significant ecosystem services. In this study, the niche and distribution of the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa in the Gulf of Mexico was evaluated using the maximum entropy (Maxent) approach. Ecological niche models were constructed for a broad region of the northern Gulf of Mexico using data gridded at a spatial resolution of 25 m, including bathymetry, substrate type, export productivity, and aragonite saturation state at depth. Fine-scale models were constructed at a resolution of 5 m using only remotely sensed bathymetric and surface reflectivity data. The broad-scale model performed well, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.981. All fine-scale models performed well when verified using training data (average AUC of 0.963) and when validated using independent occurrence data from a new geographic region (average AUC of 0.937). The distribution of L. pertusa in the Gulf of Mexico was found to be controlled primarily by depth, local topography, and availability of hard substrate. While these factors have long been associated with the success of cold-water corals, their relative importance has never been quantified in the Gulf of Mexico, making it histori-cally difficult to precisely delineate L. pertusa's niche and predict its distribution in unexplored regions. Given these results, we suggest that future expeditions combine remotely sensed data with niche modelling techniques to increase the efficiency of deep-sea exploration. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2014.},

abstract = {Aim: We aim to propose validated, spatially explicit hypotheses for the late Quaternary distribution of the Brazilian Atlantic forest, and thereby provide a framework for integrating analyses of species and genetic diversity in the region. Location: The Atlantic forest, stretching along the Brazilian coast. Methods: We model the spatial range of the forest under three climatic scenarios (current climate, 6000 and 21,000 years ago) with BIOCLIM and MAXENT. Historically stable areas or refugia are identified as the set of grid cells for which forest presence is inferred in all models and time projections. To validate inferred refugia, we test whether our models are matched by the current distribution of the forest and by fossil pollen data. We then investigate whether the location of inferred forest refugia is consistent with current patterns of species endemism and existing phylogeographical data. Results: Forest models agree with pollen records and predict a large area of historical forest stability in the central corridor (Bahia), as well as a smaller refuge (Pernambuco) along the Brazilian coast, matching current centres of endemism in multiple taxa and mtDNA diversity patterns in a subset of the species examined. Less historical stability is predicted in coastal areas south of the Doce river, which agrees with most phylogeographical studies in that region. Yet some widely distributed taxa show high endemism in the southern Atlantic forest. This may be due to limitations of the modelling approach, differences in ecology and dispersal capability, historical processes not contemplated by the current study or inadequacy of the available test data sets. Main conclusions: Palaeoclimatic models predict the presence of historical forest refugia in the Atlantic rain forest and suggest spatial variation in persistence of forests through the Pleistocene, predicting patterns of biodiversity in several local taxa. The results point to the need for further studies to document genetic and species endemism in the relatively poorly known and highly impacted areas of Atlantic rain forests of north-eastern Brazil. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Understanding the ecology of migratory birds during the non-breeding season is necessary for ensuring their conservation. Using satellite telemetry data we describe winter ranging behaviour and movements of pallid harriers Circus macrourus that bred in Kazakhstan. We developed an ecological niche model for the species in Africa, to identify the most suitable wintering areas for pallid harriers and the importance of habitat in determining the location of those areas. We also assessed how well represented suitable areas are in the network of protected areas. Individual harriers showed relatively high fidelity to wintering areas but with potential for interannual changes. The ecological niche model highlighted the importance of open habitats with natural vegetation. Most suitable areas for the species were located in eastern Africa. Suitable areas had a patchy distribution but were relatively well included in the network of protected areas. The preferential use of habitats with natural vegetation by wintering pallid harriers and the patchiness of the most suitable areas highlight the harrier's vulnerability to land-use changes and the associated loss of natural vegetation in Africa. Conservation of harriers could be enhanced by preserving natural grasslands within protected areas and improving habitat management in the human-influenced portions of the species' core wintering areas.

abstract = {Climate change poses major new challenges to biodiversity conservation. Distribution ranges of species have been proven to be affected by climate anomalies. Detecting the extent of protected species response to climate change can help formulate flexible conservation strategies to overcome the changing climate. Using species distribution modeling and high resolution climate data, we simulated current distribution patterns of 233 protected plants in China. Those patterns were then projected into future suitable habitats for each species under nine climate change scenarios, with no migration or full migration hypotheses. Under the most extreme climate change scenario (CGCM-B2a), we evaluated species extinction risks. Sixteen percent of protected plants are expected to lose more than 30 {\%} of their current ranges. By calculating areal shifts, hotspots for emigrants, immigrants, and persistent species were identified under climate change. Flexible conservation strategies were addressed for those regions. Those strategies strongly depend on the migration types of species and sensitivity of the hotspots to changing climate. In hotspots for emigrants, the main conservation strategy is ex situ protection; protected species from these regions should be stored in seed banks or botanical gardens. For hotspots of immigrants, enough space should be maintained for new species, and some measures are necessary to assist dispersal. For hotspots of persistent species, more natural reserves are needed. We highlight related fields that can help conserve protected species in the future, such as conserving the soil seed bank and understanding of the effects of migration ability and interactions between protected species. {\textcopyright} 2014, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Long-term climate data were sourced from the Worldclim website. The global distribution of CLas and ACP was gathered from online databases, literature review and communication with specialists. Data on Clas and ACP distribution in the USA were not used in model calibration to allow model validation for independent locations. Both models successfully predicted Florida and coastal areas in the Gulf Coast states as highly suitable for Clas and ACP. The models also predicted that coastal areas in California were climatologically favorable for ACP and Clas, but less so than in Florida. When current USA presence data were included in the models, the suitable areas for ACP establishment expanded to the Central Valley, CA, while this area remained less conducive for CLas. Climate suitability was primarily related to rainfall and secondarily to temperature. Globally, both models predicted that climates in large areas of Africa, Latin America and North Australia were highly suitable for ACP and CLas, while the climate in the Mediterranean area was moderately suitable for ACP but less suitable for CLas, except for that in southern Portugal and Spain. Clas predictions from our models could be informative for countries like Australia, New Zealand, citrus-producing European countries and much of Africa, where CLas and D. citri have not been reported. {\textcopyright} 2015, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.},

abstract = {Aim: Species distribution models often assume a changing climate (dynamic climate variables) but unchanged land use (static land use variables) to estimate future species distribution shifts. However, scenarios of projected land use change are available to calculate dynamic land use variables. Surprisingly, the importance of using dynamic instead of static land use variables when projecting potential future species distributions under climate change remains largely unexplored. We tested whether the joint inclusion of land use and climate change scenarios altered the projection of future species distribution compared with the classical approach assuming unchanged land use. Location: Europe Methods: We used land use and climate change scenarios to estimate the future distribution of a butterfly species (Lycaena dispar) according to different perspectives of projected environmental change: (1) land use change (dynamic land use and static climate variables), (2) climate change (static land use and dynamic climate variables) and (3) global change (dynamic land use and climate variables). As the importance of land use variables is known to depend on the spatial resolution of the models, we built them across a range of resolutions (50km, 10km and 5km) to examine the resolution-dependent relevance of using dynamic instead of static variables. Results: For each resolution, the projected distribution changes were unaltered when using dynamic instead of static land use variables in the models. It was mainly due to the low thematic resolution of the land use change scenarios that include only few dynamic variables. Main conclusions: Even at fine spatial resolution (5km), the available land use change scenarios poorly represent habitat suitability for the species. Hence, they may be of limited support to estimate future species distributions. Instead of supporting the assumption of unchanged future land use, our results plea for an improvement of the thematic resolution of land use change scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Local extirpations influence species' range contractions and are often precursors of range-wide extinction. Understanding extinction dynamics is important for devising effective management strategies to protect threatened and endangered species. The greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is an example of a species undergoing range contraction, and has been extirpated from nearly half its historically occupied habitat. We used species distribution modeling to quantify environmental variables constraining a threatened sage-grouse population inhabiting an agricultural landscape in Washington, USA. Fields planted to perennial vegetation as part of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) were important in providing year-round habitat for sage-grouse but only when intermixed with native sagebrush-steppe vegetation. Without the CRP, we estimate 66{\%} of sage-grouse habitat in the study area would become unsuitable. Conversely, if CRP allotments were concentrated near occupied native sagebrush-steppe, we estimate the area of sage-grouse habitat could be increased by up to 63{\%}. In addition to the area of native sagebrush-steppe and CRP lands, we also found that climate variability, the patch configuration of sagebrush-steppe, and proximity to major roads and transmission lines constrain the distribution of occupied habitat within the study area. Our study demonstrates how conservation programs such as CRP may be used as a management tool to reduce the risk of extirpation in agricultural areas, and to facilitate species range shifts in response to climatic changes in the sagebrush biome. {\textcopyright} The Wildlife Society, 2017.},

The largest number of widely distributed species in the Gulf of Mexico was concentrated in the northern and central regions, while biodiversity on the Yucatan Peninsula was likely to be concentrated in the north and on Cozumel island, which is the biggest island in the Mexican Caribbean. The map combining all species together revealed a potential concurrence of species in the Gulf of Mexico and Yucatan Peninsula transition, where climatic characteristics converge within a small geographic area. In order to conserve beach and coastal dune plant biodiversity, special attention must be paid to the management plans of established protected areas and to the promotion of new protected areas consistent with the areas reported in this study, particularly in the central Gulf of Mexico and northern Yucatan Peninsula, where areas under protection are currently scarce. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier GmbH.},

They are bar-headed geese (Anser indicus), ruddy shelducks (Tadorna ferruginea), whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) and black-headed gulls (Larus ridibundus). They served as major reservoir of the avian influenza viruses. We used bird watching records with the precise latitude/longitude coordinates from January 2002 to August 2014, and environmental variables with a pixel resolution of 5 km × 5 km from 2002 to 2014. The study utilized maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model based on ecological niche model approaches, and got the following results: (1) MaxEnt model have good discriminatory ability with the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating curve (ROC) of 0.86–0.97; (2) the four wild bird species were estimated to concentrate in the North China Plain, the middle and lower region of the Yangtze River, Qinghai Lake, Tianshan Mountain and Tarim Basin, part of Tibet Plateau, and Hengduan Mountains; (3) radiation and temperature were found to provide the most significant information.

abstract = {Predictive model for species distribution has been the core of ecological research since late 20th century with the development of statistical techniques and 3S tools, which not only can be applied to biodiversity conservation and management, but also enhance the ability of predicting species habitat distribution. The sample points of Chinese guger-tree (Schima superba, CGT) in the Huisun study area were obtained by GPS, and GIS technique was used to overlay five environmental factors (including terrain factors and vegetation index derived from SPOT-5 satellite images). Besides, we designed different ratios of background to target to evaluate different sampling designs for modeling individual species' distribution. The study applied MAXENT, DT and DA models to predict the suitable habitat of CGT in Huisun. The results showed that the accuracy of DT was only slightly better than that of MAXENT and accuracies of the two models were much better than that of DA. Implementation of model creation and validation was efficient, but it needed a cross-platform operation for modeling and mapping CGTs' suitable habitats. More importantly, MAXENT and DT can greatly reduce the area of field survey to 6{\%} of the entire study area at the first stage, and thus saving both cost and labor. However, increasing background samples was not always beneficial to model accuracy. Especially when the ratio of background to target became too large, the species prediction did not correspond with real distribution, thereby reducing model accuracy. This ratio falling within the range from one to five was good for species distribution modeling, but may not be optimal. Next studies will attempt to incorporate predictor variables with species spectral information extracted from high spatial, spectral resolution remotely sensed data into predictive models so that newly developed models can be applied at a larger spatial scale.},

abstract = {Background and aims - Potential natural vegetation (PNV) can provide a basic reference in guiding the restoration activities for damaged landscapes. Our aim was to find a practicable approach of reconstructing PNV based on functional groups (FGs) in species rich and fragmented forest region. Methods - A total of 149 sample plots (20 × 20 m) were laid and investigated systematically by 1 × 1 km or 1 × 2 km grids across the 482 km2 forest region in Bawangling nature reserve, Hainan Island, China. The 579 woody plant species found were aggregated into eight functional groups (FGs) according to successional status and potential maximum height. The ecological niche model (MaxEnt) was adopted in predicting the potential distribution of the FGs. The relationship between occurrence probability of FGs and environmental factors was determined as a function of the predicted response curves. The PNV was produced by the overlay of maps for the potential distribution of the FGs, while referring the FGs interactions. Key results - The predicted pioneer FGs scattered widely in the whole landscape, while climax FGs mainly distributed in the central and south part of the study region. Pioneer FGs could better withstand environmental change and occurred in warmer and drier sites, while climax FGs are distributed in cooler and wetter conditions. The PNV could be reconstructed by considering interactions among the FGs. Sixteen main functional patch types were reconstructed in the tropical forest landscape, among which twelve were dominated by climax FGs, accounting for 72.7{\%} of the area, and only four were dominated by pioneer FGs, and accounting for 18.8{\%} of the area. Conclusion-We produced successful prediction of the observed PNV by applying a niche-based model (MaxEnt) based on FGs in fragmented and species rich forest region. This is helpful for predicting how PNV will change to natural and anthropic stressors. {\textcopyright} 2013 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.},

abstract = {Background: The Triatoma brasiliensis complex is a monophyletic group, comprising three species, one of which includes two subspecific taxa, distributed across 12 Brazilian states, in the caatinga and cerrado biomes. Members of the complex are diverse in terms of epidemiological importance, morphology, biology, ecology, and genetics. Triatoma b. brasiliensis is the most disease-relevant member of the complex in terms of epidemiology, extensive distribution, broad feeding preferences, broad ecological distribution, and high rates of infection with Trypanosoma cruzi; consequently, it is considered the principal vector of Chagas disease in northeastern Brazil. Methods. We used ecological niche models to estimate potential distributions of all members of the complex, and evaluated the potential for suitable adjacent areas to be colonized; we also present first evaluations of potential for climate change-mediated distributional shifts. Models were developed using the GARP and Maxent algorithms. Results: Models for three members of the complex (T. b. brasiliensis, N = 332; T. b. macromelasoma, N = 35; and T. juazeirensis, N = 78) had significant distributional predictivity; however, models for T. sherlocki and T. melanica, both with very small sample sizes (N = 7), did not yield predictions that performed better than random. Model projections onto future-climate scenarios indicated little broad-scale potential for change in the potential distribution of the complex through 2050. Conclusions: This study suggests that T. b. brasiliensis is the member of the complex with the greatest distributional potential to colonize new areas: overall; however, the distribution of the complex appears relatively stable. These analyses offer key information to guide proactive monitoring and remediation activities to reduce risk of Chagas disease transmission. {\textcopyright} 2014 Costa et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

We used occurrence data from the only known population, in the Lassen Peak region of northern California, combined with climatic and remotely sensed variables, to predict the species' potential distribution throughout its historic range. These model predictions can guide future surveys to locate additional fox populations. Moreover, they allow us to compare the relative performances of presence-absence (logistic regression) and presence-only (maximum entropy, or Maxent) modeling approaches using occurrence data with potential false absences and geographical biases. We also evaluated the recently revised Maxent algorithm that reduces the effect of geographically biased occurrence data by subsetting background pixels to match biases in the occurrence data. Within the Lassen Peak region, all models had good fit to the test data, with high values for the true skill statistic (76-83{\%}), percent correctly classified (86-92{\%}), and area under the curve (0.94-0.96), with Maxent models yielding slightly higher values. Outside the Lassen Peak region, the logistic regression model yielded the highest predictive performance, providing the closest match to the fox's historic range and also predicting a site where red foxes were subsequently detected in autumn 2010. Subsetting background pixels in Maxent reduced but did not eliminate the effect that geographically biased occurrence data had on prediction results relative to the Maxent model using full background pixels. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract = {Species distribution models are usually evaluated with cross-validation. In this procedure evaluation statistics are computed from model predictions for sites of presence and absence that were not used to train (fit) the model. Using data for 226 species, from six regions, and two species distribution modeling algorithms (Bioclim and MaxEnt), I show that this procedure is highly sensitive to "spatial sorting bias": the difference between the geographic distance from testing-presence to training-presence sites and the geographic distance from testing-absence (or testing-background) to training-presence sites. I propose the use of pairwise distance sampling to remove this bias, and the use of a null model that only considers the geographic distance to training sites to calibrate cross-validation results for remaining bias. Model evaluation results (AUC) were strongly inflated: the null model performed better than MaxEnt for 45{\%} and better than Bioclim for 67{\%} of the species. Spatial sorting bias and area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) values increased when using partitioned presence data and random-absence data instead of independently obtained presence-absence testing data from systematic surveys. Pairwise distance sampling removed spatial sorting bias, yielding null models with an AUC close to 0.5, such that AUC was the same as null model calibrated AUC (cAUC). This adjustment strongly decreased AUC values and changed the ranking among species. Cross-validation results for different species are only comparable after removal of spatial sorting bias and/or calibration with an appropriate null model. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {On the basis of maximum entropy method embedded in MaxEnt software, the cartographic models are designed for spatial distribution of 63 species of vascular plants inhabiting low mountain belt of the Tukuringra Range. Initial data for modeling were actual points of a species occurrence, data on remote sensing (multispectral space snapshots by Landsat), and a digital topographic model. It is found out that the structure of factors contributing to the model is related to species ecological amplitude. The distribution of stenotopic species is determined, mainly, by the topography, which thermal and humidity conditions of habitats are associated with. To the models for eurytopic species, variables formed on the basis of remote sensing contribute significantly, those variables encompassing the parameters of the soil-vegetable cover. In course of the obtained models analyzing, three principal groups of species are revealed that have similar distribution pattern. Species of the first group are restricted in their distribution by the slopes of the. River Zeya and River Giluy gorges. Species of the second group are associated with the southern macroslope of the range and with southern slopes of large rivers' valleys. The third group incorporates those species that are distributed over the whole territory under study.},

abstract = {1. Non-native, invasive species can affect biological patterns and processes at multiple ecological scales. The multi-scalar effects of invasions can influence community structure, ecosystem processes and function, and the nature and intensity of ecological interactions. Consequently, efforts to assess the spread of invasive species may benefit from a multi-scale analytic approach. 2. We analysed results from landscape- and population-scale models for Syzygium jambos, a non-native tree in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico, to demonstrate a multi-scale approach that can be used to inform management decisions about invasive plants. At the landscape-level, we used an Ecological Niche Modelling approach to predict environmentally suitable habitats for the target plant. At the population-level, we constructed matrix projection models to determine the finite rate of population increase ($\lambda$) for S. jambos. We then extrapolated $\lambda$ values to the landscape-scale to obtain a distribution map of $\lambda$ values for the Luquillo forest. 3. The landscape analyses suggested that the most environmentally suitable habitats were those most similar to where S. jambos had already been observed. The population-level analyses showed that four of the seven populations had $\lambda$ values less than 1, indicating that they were projected to be below replacement. The $\lambda$ distribution map showed that S. jambos growth was highest in areas where it was most common and lowest in areas where it was most rare. 4. Our analyses further suggested that the importance of different drivers of invasion and the environmental variables that mediate them appear to be strongly scale-dependent. Past disturbances seemed most important for controlling invasions at fine-spatial scales; while abiotic environmental variables modulated coarse-scale invasion dynamics. 5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown that a multi-scale analytic approach can be used to manage invasive species by simultaneously targeting susceptible life stages and rapidly growing populations in a landscape. The utility of this approach stems from an ability to: (i) map the distribution of habitats that can potentially sustain $\lambda$ values above replacement; (ii) identify populations to manage or monitor during selected stages of an invasion; (iii) forecast the probability for a target species to increase above a critical threshold abundance; and (iv) set priorities for control and monitoring actions. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Marine nematodes of the genus Anisakis are common parasites of a wide range of aquatic organisms. Public interest is primarily based on their importance as zoonotic agents of the human Anisakiasis, a severe infection of the gastro-intestinal tract as result of consuming live larvae in insufficiently cooked fish dishes. The diverse nature of external impacts unequally influencing larval and adult stages of marine endohelminth parasites requires the consideration of both abiotic and biotic factors. Whereas abiotic factors are generally more relevant for early life stages and might also be linked to intermediate hosts, definitive hosts are indispensable for a parasite's reproduction. In order to better understand the uneven occurrence of parasites in fish species, we here use the maximum entropy approach (Maxent) to model the habitat suitability for nine Anisakis species accounting for abiotic parameters as well as biotic data (definitive hosts). The modelled habitat suitability reflects the observed distribution quite well for all Anisakis species, however, in some cases, habitat suitability exceeded the known geographical distribution, suggesting a wider distribution than presently recorded. We suggest that integrative modelling combining abiotic and biotic parameters is a valid approach for habitat suitability assessments of Anisakis, and potentially other marine parasite species. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016.},

We investigate ecological diversification among members of the Simulium arcticum species complex at different stages of chromosome divergence. Our analyses focus on two geographical scales. First, we assess ecological divergence of sibling species throughout North America using niche modelling methods. Then, using canonical correspondence analysis, we investigate habitat associations of sibling species and cytotypes in the northern Rocky Mountains ecoregion, where cytotypes tend to occur. Despite significant overlap in predicted distributions, all sibling species are ecologically unique. On the other hand, we discover various degrees of ecological divergence for cytotypes. Some cytotypes are ecologically distinct and perhaps are in their initial stages of incipient speciation. Other cytotypes are ecologically associated with one another or with particular sibling species. Thus, for members of the S.arcticum complex, ecological and chromosomal differences tend to develop early in lineage formation. Ecological distinctiveness of sibling species and cytotypes suggests that local adaptation may be involved in diversification of these chromosomal forms. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Linnean Society of London.},

Despite the number of recent studies on this species, Adansonia digitata, little is known from Malawi, the main exporter of baobab fruit pulp in Africa. Materials and methods. Information on distribution and density of baobab trees present in Malawi was gathered from field surveys. The Maxent software based on the maximum-entropy approach for species habitat modelling was used together with spatial environmental data and geo-referenced records of the baobab tree to analyse its ecological preferences and potential cultivation sites. Farmers were interviewed about who was using and buying baobab fruits in different areas. Fruit and leaf morphological diversity was assessed in eight study sites selected along a latitudinal gradient. Results and discussion. The baobab tree was found to be widely distributed in southern Malawi, with variable densities. Modelling results show that this species could be cultivated in most of the southern region. A large morphological diversity in both fruit and leaf characteristics was observed, which gives the opportunity to select more desirable characters for cultivation. Conclusion. Our study showed that, while some areas of high baobab tree density could be further exploited, its cultivation, however, should be recommended in areas with low density of baobab trees in southern Malawi because there is little natural regeneration. Moreover, this study suggested that there is room for selecting baobab planting material with desirable characteristics for cultivation purposes in Malawi. {\textcopyright} 2011 Cirad/EDP Sciences.},

abstract = {Range maps provide important information in species conservation management, specially in the case of rare species of conservation interest. For the vast majority of cases, this information can only be estimated by means of species distribution modelling. When absence data is unavailable, modelled distribution maps represent the spatial variation of the degree of suitability for the species rather than their realised distribution. Although discerning potentially suitable areas for a given species is an important asset in conservation, it is necessary to estimate current distributions in order to preserve current populations. This work explores the use of species distribution modelling (Maxent) for species of conservation interest when their Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is well-known and there is quality occurrence data. In this case, derived binary maps of potentially suitable areas can be obtained and used to assess the conservation and protection status of a given species in combination with the EOO and existing protected area networks. Seven species, which are rare and endemic to the Western Mediterranean, have been used as an example. Valuable information for conservation assessment such as potentially suitable areas, EOO, Areas of Occupancy (AOO) and degree of protection is provided for this set of species. In addition, the existing informal view that among experts these species have range sizes much smaller than their potentially suitable area is confirmed. This could probably be attributed to important but currently unknown predictor variables and to historical phylogeographic factors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In order to provide scientific evidence for effective prevention and control of P. canaliculata, a most suitable ecological niche model was selected to predict the potential suitable distribution areas of P. canaliculata in China. Based on 377 reported occurrence points and 19 bioclimatic variables, four ecological niche models, MaxEnt, GARP, BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN, the potential geographic suitable distribution areas were predicted for the invasive snail. Then, the results of different models were analyzed and compared with two statistical criteria, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and Kappa value. The results showed that all of the four ecological niche models could simulate the snail's distributions very well. More specifically, the MaxEnt model outperformed the others in all aspects of predicting the snail's potential distribution (AUC=0.955±0.004, Kappa=0.845±0.017), followed by GARP and DOMAIN. Although BIOCLIM offered the lowest prediction accuracy, its AUC was 0.898±0.017 and its Kappa value was 0.771±0.025. Based on the MaxEnt model, the prediction results showed that the potential suitable distribution areas of P. canaliculata were mainly located in the south of 30° N in China, but there was some regions spreading over the north of 30°N. The potential areas accounted for 13.2{\%} of the national land in area. Notably, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Chongqing, Zhejiang and the coastal areas of Fujian were potentially high-risk areas. In conclusion, this study would be an important reference for the prevention and control of the invasive apple snail P. canaliculata and it also would be an example of predicting the potential distribution of aquatic alien species on large scale. {\textcopyright} 2016, Science Press.

abstract = {Least-cost models are widely used to study the functional connectivity of habitat within a varied landscape matrix. A critical step in the process is identifying resistance values for each land cover based upon the facilitating or impeding impact on species movement. Ideally resistance values would be parameterised with empirical data, but due to a shortage of such information, expert-opinion is often used. However, the use of expert-opinion is seen as subjective, human-centric and unreliable. This study derived resistance values from grey squirrel habitat suitability models (HSM) in order to compare the utility and validity of this approach with more traditional, expert-led methods. Models were built and tested with MaxEnt, using squirrel presence records and a categorical land cover map for Cumbria, UK. Predictions on the likelihood of squirrel occurrence within each land cover type were inverted, providing resistance values which were used to parameterise a leastcost model. The resulting habitat networks were measured and compared to those derived from a least-cost model built with previously collated information from experts. The expert-derived and HSM-inferred least-cost networks differ in precision. The HSM-informed networks were smaller and more fragmented because of the higher resistance values attributed to most habitats. These results are discussed in relation to the applicability of both approaches for conservation and management objectives, providing guidance to researchers and practitioners attempting to apply and interpret a leastcost approach to mapping ecological networks. {\textcopyright} 2014 PLOS ONE.},

abstract = {There are many methods for modeling species distribution in the landscape. In this chapter, the authors elaborate on the concepts of species modeling and present three popular techniques to generate species distribution: cartographic overlay, logistic multiple regression and maximum entropy (MAXENT). The cartographic overlay method is relevant to generate a habitat suitability index. Logistic multiple regression generates the probability of distribution based on presence and absence of data in relation to habitat factors. The authors use pseudo absence data selected randomly from low suitability classes, because real absence data were not available. The third technique, maximum entropy method (MAXENT), uses presence-only data. The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) was selected as a proxy species for this study. The study was conducted in Bun Tharik-Yod Mon, a proposed wildlife sanctuary in northeast Thailand. The results show that among the three approaches, the potentially suitable habitats derived from cartographic overlay cover the largest area and are likely to overestimate existing occurrence areas. The logistic regression model predicts approximately 56{\%} as suitable area, while maximum entropy results covers approximately 9{\%} of the sanctuary. Although the results show large differences in the suitable areas, it should not be concluded that any one method always proves better than the others. Utilization of any method is dependent on the situation and available information. If species observations are limited, the cartographic overlay or habitat suitability is recommended. The logistic regression method is recommended when adequate presence and absence data are available. If presence-only data is available, a niche-based model or the maximum entropy method (MAXENT) is highly recommended. {\textcopyright} 2011, IGI Global.},

abstract = {1. Statistical modelling of habitat suitability is an important tool for planning conservation interventions, particularly for areas where species distribution data are expensive or hard to collect. Sometimes however the predictor variables typically used in habitat suitability modelling are themselves difficult to obtain or not meaningful at the geographical extent of the study, as is the case for the Alaotran gentle lemur Hapalemur alaotrensis, a critically endangered lemur confined to the marshes of Lake Alaotra in Madagascar.2. We developed a habitat suitability model where all predictor variables, including vegetation indices and image texture measures at different scales (as surrogates for habitat structure), were derived from Landsat7 satellite imagery. Using relatively few presence records, the maximum entropy (Maxent) approach and AUC were used to assess the performance of candidate predictor variables, for studying the effect of scale, model selection and mapping suitable habitat.3. This study demonstrated the utility of satellite imagery as a single source of predictor variables for a Maxent habitat suitability model at the landscape level, within a restricted geographical extent and with a fine grain, in a case where predictor variables typically used at the macro-scale level (e.g. climatic and topographic) were not applicable.4. In the case of H. alaotrensis, the methodology generated a habitat suitability map to inform conservation management in Lake Alaotra and a replicable protocol to allow rapid updates to habitat suitability maps in the future. The exploration of candidate predictor variables allowed the identification of scales that appear ecologically relevant for the species.5. Synthesis and applications. This study presents a cost-effective combination of maximum entropy habitat suitability modelling and satellite imagery, where all predictor variables are derived solely from Landsat7 images. With a habitat modelling method like Maxent that shows good performance with few presence samples and Landsat images now freely available, the methodology can play an important role in rapid assessments of the status of species at the landscape level in data-poor regions, when typical macro-scale environmental predictors are of little use or difficult to obtain. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Climate change projections in Colombia predict an average increase in temperature of 2.6°C and in precipitation of 20{\%} by the end of the century. These changes would directly affect the tropical dry forest (TDF) and its biodiversity. Epiphytic orchids, more exposed to the atmosphere than the terrestrial biota, remain dependent on climatic variables, making them particularly susceptible to climate change. We studied the spatial and temporal changes of a focal group of 12 orchid species typical of the TDF in Colombia, and the future conservation areas to this ecosystem. The algorithm used by MaxEnt was employed for modelling. A total of 439 records: direct observations (276); herbaria collections (159) and bibliographical sources (4) collected since September 2009 to April 2015 were considered for use in training the model. The actual potential niche was compared to the SRES 8.5 climate change emissions scenario for two periods: 2020-2049 (2030) and 2040-2069 (2050). The results indicate an altitudinal displacement compared to the present, conditioned by variables such as temperature, accessibility and precipitation. Mid-mountain areas (1300-1700 m) increased their idoneity in future potential niche models (2030 and 2050) to the detriment of the lowlands (0-1000 m). Other variables analysed, such as distance thresholds of pollinators (Euglossini), availability of phorophytes, and distances to TDF cover and protected areas, all suggest an improving connectivity between the lowland and mid-mountain areas. Consequently, bioclimatic niches (BN) are proposed as a new landscape management unit.

abstract = {Invasive plant species threaten native ecosystems, natural resources, and managed lands worldwide. Climate change may increase risk from invasive plant species as favorable climate conditions allow invaders to expand into new ranges. Here, we use bioclimatic envelope modeling to assess current climatic habitat, or lands climatically suitable for invasion, for three of the most dominant and aggressive invasive plants in the southeast United States: kudzu (Pueraria lobata), privet (Ligustrum sinense; L. vulgare), and cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica). We define climatic habitat using both the Maxent and Mahalanobis distance methodologies, and we define the best climatic predictors based on variables that best 'constrain' species distributions and variables that 'release' the most land area if excluded. We then use an ensemble of 12 atmosphere-ocean general circulation models to project changes in climatic habitat for the three invasive species by 2100. The combined methodologies, predictors, and models produce a robust assessment of invasion risk inclusive of many of the approaches typically used individually to assess climate change impacts. Current invasion risk is widespread in southeastern states for all three species, although cogongrass invasion risk is more restricted to the Gulf Coast. Climate change is likely to enable all three species to greatly expand their ranges. Risk from privet and kudzu expands north into Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and New England states by 2100. Risk from cogongrass expands as far north as Kentucky and Virginia. Heightened surveillance and prompt eradication of small pockets of invasion in northern states should be a management priority. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract = {Accurately defining disease distributions and calculating disease risk is an important step in the control and prevention of diseases. Geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies, with maximum entropy (Maxent) ecological niche modelling computer software, were used to create predictive risk maps for Chagas disease in Bolivia. Prevalence rates were calculated from 2007 to 2009 household infection survey data for Bolivia, while environmental data were compiled from the Worldclim database and MODIS satellite imagery. Socio-economic data were obtained from the Bolivian National Institute of Statistics. Disease models identified altitudes at 500-3,500 m above the mean sea level (MSL), low annual precipitation (45-250 mm), and higher diurnal range of temperature (10-19 °C; peak 16 °C) as compatible with the biological requirements of the insect vectors. Socio-economic analyses demonstrated the importance of improved housing materials and water source. Home adobe wall materials and having to fetch drinking water from rivers or wells without pump were found to be highly related to distribution of the disease by the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) (0.69 AUC, 0.67 AUC and 0.62 AUC, respectively), while areas with hardwood floors demonstrated a direct negative relationship (-0.71 AUC). This study demonstrates that Maxent modelling can be used in disease prevalence and incidence studies to provide governmental agencies with an easily learned, understandable method to define areas as either high, moderate or low risk for the disease. This information may be used in resource planning, targeting and implementation. However, access to high-resolution, sub-municipality socio-economic data (e.g. census tracts) would facilitate elucidation of the relative influence of poverty-related factors on regional disease dynamics.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to have a comparative investigation and evaluation of the capabilities of correlative and mechanistic modeling processes, applied to the projection of future distributions of date palm in novel environments and to establish a method of minimizing uncertainty in the projections of differing techniques. The location of this study on a global scale is in Middle Eastern Countries. We compared the mechanistic model CLIMEX (CL) with the correlative models MaxEnt (MX), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Random Forests (RF) to project current and future distributions of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.). The Global Climate Model (GCM), the CSIRO-Mk3.0 (CS) using the A2 emissions scenario, was selected for making projections. Both indigenous and alien distribution data of the species were utilized in the modeling process. The common areas predicted by MX, BRT, RF, and CL from the CS GCM were extracted and compared to ascertain projection uncertainty levels of each individual technique. The common areas identified by all four modeling techniques were used to produce a map indicating suitable and unsuitable areas for date palm cultivation for Middle Eastern countries, for the present and the year 2100. The four different modeling approaches predict fairly different distributions. Projections from CL were more conservative than from MX. The BRT and RF were the most conservative methods in terms of projections for the current time. The combination of the final CL and MX projections for the present and 2100 provide higher certainty concerning those areas that will become highly suitable for future date palm cultivation. According to the four models, cold, hot, and wet stress, with differences on a regional basis, appears to be the major restrictions on future date palm distribution. The results demonstrate variances in the projections, resulting from different techniques. The assessment and interpretation of model projections requires reservations, especially in correlative models such as MX, BRT, and RF. Intersections between different techniques may decrease uncertainty in future distribution projections. However, readers should not miss the fact that the uncertainties are mostly because the future GHG emission scenarios are unknowable with sufficient precision. Suggestions towards methodology and processing for improving projections are included. {\textcopyright} 2016 Springer-Verlag Wien},

abstract = {Many animals show sex differences in foraging behaviour, which can be related to sex-specific size dimorphism, avoidance of intersexual competition for depletable resources or different energetic requirements of males and females. In southern rockhopper penguins, Eudyptes chrysocome, both sexes differ in their roles during breeding, which leads to differences in their energetic requirements. We therefore examined sex differences in the foraging behaviour of southern rockhopper penguins during the incubation period, using GPS and time-depth data, stable isotope analysis and an automated weighbridge system. While males carried out mostly long trips lasting several days, females often used coastal foraging areas on day trips. Stable isotope data suggested differences in prey composition between the sexes, with consistently higher trophic levels in males as expected for their larger size and ability to catch larger prey items. We applied ecological niche models to compare the environmental conditions in the utilized incubation season habitat between the sexes, using MaxEnt modelling. MaxEnt models suggested that the niche spaces of males and females are largely overlapping, but males have slightly larger niche width. The most important environmental parameter was sea surface temperature. The different energetic requirements related to the birds' incubation and chick-provisioning pattern seem to be the driving force behind the observed spatial segregation. Males make use of highly productive areas to prepare for subsequent fasting periods whereas females forage in coastal waters for themselves as well as for the chicks during the subsequent guard stage. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

We conducted a systematic survey of the core forest area, performing 1,680 point counts and compiling occasional observations, which enabled the identification of new areas of occurrence for the target species. MaxEnt distribution modelling suggested that the ibis and fiscal have roughly half of the potential area of occurrence that had been assumed (127 and 117 km2, respectively), while it more than doubled that of the grosbeak (187 km2). The south-west central region of the island, most of which is included in the S{\~{a}}o Tom{\'{e}} Ob{\^{o}} Natural Park, has the highest potential for the Critically Endangered birds. We confirmed the association of all target species with native forest. The ibis preferred high tree density, while the fiscal selected low tree density and intermediate altitudes. Despite very restricted ranges, population sizes seem to be larger than previously assumed. These results suggest that the fiscal and grosbeak might be better classified as ‘Endangered', while the ibis should maintain its status under different criteria, due to a very restricted range during the breeding season. This work provides vital ecological knowledge to support conservation action focusing on these species and their habitats, highlighting the need to improve the effectiveness of the S{\~{a}}o Tom{\'{e}} Ob{\^{o}} Natural Park in protecting its unique biodiversity.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Triatoma virus (TrV) is the only entomopathogenous virus identified in triatomines. We estimated the potential geographic distribution of triatomine species naturally infected by TrV, using remotely sensed and meteorological environmental variables, to predict new potential areas where triatomines infected with TrV may be found.
METHODS: Detection of TrV infection in samples was performed with RT-PCR. Ecological niche models (ENM) were constructed using the MaxEnt software. We used 42 environmental variables derived from remotely sensed imagery (AVHRR) and 19 bioclimatic variables (Bioclim). The MaxEnt Jackknife procedure was used to minimize the number of environmental variables that showed an influence on final models. The goodness of fit of the model predictions was evaluated by the mean area under the curve (AUC).
RESULTS: We obtained 37 samples of 7 species of triatomines naturally infected with TrV. Of the TrV positive samples, 32{\%} were from sylvatic habitat, 46{\%} came from peridomicile habitats and 22{\%} from domicile habitats. Five of the seven infected species were found only in the sylvatic habitat, one species only in the domicile and only Triatoma infestans was found in the three habitats. The MaxEnt model estimated with the Bioclim dataset identified five environmental variables as best predictors: temperature annual range, mean diurnal range, mean temperature of coldest quarter, temperature seasonality and annual mean temperature. The model using the AVHRR dataset identified six environmental variables: minimum Land Surface Temperature (LST), minimum Middle Infrared Radiation (MIR), LST annual amplitude, MIR annual amplitude annual, LST variance and MIR variance. The potential geographic distribution of triatomine species infected by TrV coincides with the Chaco and the Monte ecoregions either modelled by AVHRR or Bioclim environmental datasets.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the conditions of the Dry Chaco ecoregion in Argentina are favourable for the infection of triatomine species with TrV, and open the possibility of its use as a potential agent for the biological control of peridomestic and/or sylvatic triatomine species. Results identify areas of potential occurrence that should be verified in the field.},

Thus, explicit attention to scale dependency in species-habitat relationships is critical to understand the habitat suitability patterns as perceived by organisms in complex landscapes. Identification of the scales at which particular environmental variables influence habitat selection may be as important as the selection of variables themselves. In this study, we combined bivariate scaling and Maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling to investigate multiscale habitat selection of endangered brown bear (Ursus arctos) populations in northwest Spain. Bivariate scaling showed that the strength of apparent habitat relationships was highly sensitive to the scale at which predictor variables are evaluated. Maxent models on the optimal scale for each variable suggested that landscape composition together with human disturbances was dominant drivers of bear habitat selection, while habitat configuration and edge effects were substantially less influential. We found that explicitly optimizing the scale of habitat suitability models considerably improved single-scale modeling in terms of model performance and spatial prediction. We found that patterns of brown bear habitat suitability represent the cumulative influence of habitat selection across a broad range of scales, from local resources within habitat patches to the landscape composition at broader spatial scales. {\textcopyright} 2013 {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {The relative contributions of climate versus interspecific interactions in shaping species distributions have important implications for closely related species at contact zones. When hybridization occurs within a contact zone, these factors regulate hybrid zone location and movement. While a hybrid zone's position may depend on both climate and interactions between the hybridizing species, little is known about how these factors interact to affect hybrid zone dynamics. Here, we utilize SDM (species distribution modeling) both to characterize the factors affecting the current location of a moving North American avian hybrid zone and to predict potential direct and indirect effects of climate change on future distributions. We focus on two passerine species that hybridize where their ranges meet, the Black-capped (Poecile atricapillus) and Carolina (P. carolinensis) chickadee. Our contemporary climate models predict the occurrence of climatically suitable habitat extending beyond the hybrid zone for P. atricapillus only, suggesting that interspecific interactions primarily regulate this range boundary in P. atricapillus, while climatic factors regulate P. carolinensis. Year 2050 climate models predict a drastic northward shift in suitable habitat for P. carolinensis. Because of the greater importance of interspecific interactions for regulating the southern range limit of P. atricapillus, these climate-mediated shifts in the distribution of P. carolinensis may indirectly lead to a range retraction in P. atricapillus. Together, our results highlight the ways climate change can both directly and indirectly affect species distributions and hybrid zone location. In addition, our study lends support to the longstanding hypothesis that abiotic factors regulate species' poleward range limits, while biotic factors shape equatorial range limits. {\textcopyright} 2015 Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Two ecologically and economically important, and threatened Dipterocarp trees Sal (Shorea robusta) and Garjan (Dipterocarpus turbinatus) form mono-specific canopies in dry deciduous, moist deciduous, evergreen, and semievergreen forests across South Asia and continental parts of Southeast Asia. They provide valuable timber and play an important role in the economy of many Asian countries. However, both Dipterocarp trees are threatened by continuing forest clearing, habitat alteration, and global climate change. While climatic regimes in the Asian tropics are changing, research on climate change-driven shifts in the distribution of tropical Asian trees is limited. We applied a bioclimatic modeling approach to these two Dipterocarp trees Sal and Garjan. We used presence-only records for the tree species, five bioclimatic variables, and selected two climatic scenarios (RCP4.5: an optimistic scenario and RCP8.5: a pessimistic scenario) and three global climate models (GCMs) to encompass the full range of variation in the models. We modeled climate space suitability for both species, projected to 2070, using a climate envelope modeling tool “MaxEnt” (the maximum entropy algorithm). Annual precipitation was the key bioclimatic variable in all GCMs for explaining the current and future distributions of Sal and Garjan (Sal: 49.97 ± 1.33; Garjan: 37.63 ± 1.19). Our models predict that suitable climate space for Sal will decline by 24{\%} and 34{\%} (the mean of the three GCMs) by 2070 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. In contrast, the consequences of imminent climate change appear less severe for Garjan, with a decline of 17{\%} and 27{\%} under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. The findings of this study can be used to set conservation guidelines for Sal and Garjan by identifying vulnerable habitats in the region. In addition, the natural habitats of Sal and Garjan can be categorized as low to high risk under changing climates where artificial regeneration should be undertaken for forest restoration. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {If species distribution models (SDMs) can rank habitat suitability at a local scale, they may be a valuable conservation planning tool for rare, patchily distributed species. This study assessed the ability of Maxent, an SDM reported to be appropriate for modeling rare species, to rank habitat suitability at a local scale for four edaphic endemic rare plants of gabbroic soils in El Dorado County, California, and examined the effects of grain size, spatial extent, and fine-grain environmental predictors on local-scale model accuracy. Models were developed using species occurrence data mapped on public lands and were evaluated using an independent data set of presence and absence locations on surrounding lands, mimicking a typical conservation-planning scenario that prioritizes potential habitat on unsurveyed lands surrounding known occurrences. Maxent produced models that were successful at discriminating between suitable and unsuitable habitat at the local scale for all four species, and predicted habitat suitability values were proportional to likelihood of occurrence or population abundance for three of four species. Unfortunately, models with the best discrimination (i.e., AUC) were not always the most useful for ranking habitat suitability. The use of independent test data showed metRicas that were valuable for evaluating which variables and model choices (e.g., grain, extent) to use in guiding habitat prioritization for conservation of these species. A goodness-of-fit test was used to determine whether habitat suitability values ranked habitat suitability on a continuous scale. If they did not, a minimum acceptable error predicted area criterion was used to determine the threshold for classifying habitat as suitable or unsuitable. I found a trade-off between model extent and the use of fine-grain environmental variables: goodness of fit was improved at larger extents, and fine-grain environmental variables improved local-scale accuracy, but fine-grain variables were not available at large extents. No single model met all habitat prioritization criteria, and the best models were overlaid to identify consensus areas of high suitability. Although the four species modeled here co-occur and are treated together for conservation planning, model accuracy and predicted suitable areas varied among species. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Three land use change scenarios between 2002-2050 were evaluated. Scenario 1 is a continuation of land use trends and predicts that forest cover will decrease from the present 57{\%} to only 45{\%} in 2050. Scenario 2 is an integrated-management scenario and scenario 3 is a conservation-oriented scenario directed by government policy to maintain respectively 50{\%} and 55{\%} forest cover (natural forest and plantation) and strictly prevent encroachment in protected areas. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and a spatially-explicit model (CLUE-s) were employed to explore land use changes. In addition, a machine learning algorithm based on maximum entropy theory (MAXENT) was used to generate ecological niches of 18 large mammal species as a proxy of biodiversity. The likely occurrences of selected wildlife species were aggregated and classified as wildlife concentrations. In addition, the predicted deforestation areas were overlaid on high wildlife concentration to determine threats to wildlife or wildlife hotspots both inside and outside protected areas. The results reveal that forest cover in 2050 will mainly persist in the west and upper north of the region, which is rugged and not easily accessible. In contrast, the highest deforestation is expected to occur in the lower north and remnant habitats will disappear in this area. Current suitable habitats for most wildlife species are located in the west, north and east of the region. The predicted areas of high wildlife concentration or richness (≥ 7 species likely present) are found in the western forest complex and in the northeast of the region, covering approximately 16,000 km2 or 9.3{\%} of the region. In addition, wildlife hotspots derived from the trend scenario encompass approximately 3,100 km2 or 1.8{\%} and 74{\%} is predicted in protected area coverage. These areas are identified as high priority for biodiversity conservation. In contrast, the hotspots are predicted of less than 0.5{\%} for the scenarios 2 and 3. Based on the model outcomes, we recommend conservation measures to minimize the impacts of future deforestation on wildlife hotspots. {\textcopyright} 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach to modeling sequences using mixtures of conditional maximum entropy (maxent) distributions. Our method generalizes the mixture of firstorder Markov models by including the "long-term" dependencies in model components. The "long-term" dependencies are represented by the frequently used in the natural language processing (NLP) domain probabilistic triggers or rules (such as "A occurred k positions back" ⇒ "the current symbol is B " with probability P). The maxent framework is then used to create a coherent global probabilistic model from all selected triggers. In this paper, we enhance this formalism by using probabilistic mixtures with maxent models as components, thus representing hidden or unobserved effects in the data. We demonstrate how our mixture of conditional maxent models can be learned from data using the generalized EM algorithm that scales linearly in the dimensions of the data and the number of mixture components. We present empirical results on the simulated and real-world data sets and demonstrate that the proposed approach enables us to create better quality models than the mixtures of first-order Markov models and resist overfitting and curse of dimensionality that would inevitably present themselves for the higher order Markov models. {\textcopyright} 2003 IEEE.},

abstract = {Understanding the environmental factors determining the distribution of species with different range sizes can provide valuable insights for evolutionary ecology and conservation biology in the face of expected climate change. However, little is known about what determines the variation in geographical and elevational ranges of alpine and subalpine plant species. Here, we examined the relationship between geographical and elevational range sizes for 80 endemic rhododendron species in China using Spearman's rank-order correlation. We ran the species distribution model – maximum entropy modelling (MaxEnt) – with 27 environmental variables. The importance of each variable to the model prediction was compared for species groups with different geographical and elevational range sizes. Our results showed that the correlation between geographical and elevational range sizes of rhododendron species was not significant. Climate-related variables were found to be the most important factors in shaping the distributional ranges of alpine and subalpine plant species across China. Species with geographically and elevationally narrow ranges had distinct niche requirements. For geographical ranges, the narrow-ranged species showed less tolerance to niche conditions than the wide-ranged species. For elevational ranges, compared with the wide-ranged species, the narrow-ranged species showed an equivalent niche breadth, but occurred at different niche position along the environmental gradient. Our findings suggest that over large spatial extents the elevational range size can be a complementary trait of alpine and subalpine plant species to geographical range size. Climatic niche breadth, especially the range of seasonal variability, can explain species' geographical range sizes. Changes in climate may influence the distribution of rhododendrons, with the effects likely being felt most by species with either a narrow geographical or narrow elevational range. {\textcopyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

abstract = {1. Understanding the factors affecting species occurrence is a pre-eminent focus of applied ecological research. However, direct information about species occurrence is lacking for many species. Instead, researchers sometimes have to rely on so-called presence-only data (i.e. when no direct information about absences is available), which often results from opportunistic, unstructured sampling. maxent is a widely used software program designed to model and map species distribution using presence-only data. 2.We provide a critical review of maxent as applied to species distribution modelling and discuss how it can lead to inferential errors. A chief concern is that maxent produces a number of poorly defined indices that are not directly related to the actual parameter of interest - the probability of occurrence ($\psi$). This focus on an index was motivated by the belief that it is not possible to estimate $\psi$ from presence-only data; however, we demonstrate that $\psi$ is identifiable using conventional likelihood methods under the assumptions of random sampling and constant probability of species detection. 3.The model is implemented in a convenient r package which we use to apply the model to simulated data and data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. We demonstrate that maxent produces extreme under-predictions when compared to estimates produced by logistic regression which uses the full (presence/absence) data set. We note that maxent predictions are extremely sensitive to specification of the background prevalence, which is not objectively estimated using the maxent method. 4.As with maxent, formal model-based inference requires a random sample of presence locations. Many presence-only data sets, such as those based on museum records and herbarium collections, may not satisfy this assumption. However, when sampling is random, we believe that inference should be based on formal methods that facilitate inference about interpretable ecological quantities instead of vaguely defined indices. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Aim We aim to map the distribution of four heath and shrub formations constituting habitats of high conservation priority in Europe, whose occurrence is strongly dependent on human activities. Specifically, we assess whether the use of LANDSAT data in habitat distribution modelling may account for land use management, allowing accurate mapping of real distribution patterns. In particular, we explore whether reflectance values may be a better alternative to other remote sensing data traditionally used in modelling approaches (i.e. spectral vegetation indices and classified land cover maps). Finally, we test whether modelling performance is affected by the ecological traits of the dominant species of the target formations. Location Cantabrian Mountains (NW Spain). Methods We generated maps for the four formations (two specialists vs. two generalists) using MaxEnt. First, we ran the models with environmental predictors only (topography, climate, lithology and human disturbances). Then, we compared the advantages of including, in turn, different data derived from LANDSAT imagery: reflectance values (corresponding to different wavelength channels of the multispectral image), a spectral index and a land cover map. We assessed changes in explanatory power and also in the formation's predicted distribution patterns. Results Formations dominated by specialist species were accurately mapped on a base of environmental variables only, whereas those dominated by generalists were overpredicted. Average mean temperature, southness and distance to urban areas were the variables contributing most in predictions of environmental models. LANDSAT channels increased the accuracy of all models, but mainly those for formations dominated by generalist species. They showed advantages against other remote sensing data traditionally used in modelling approaches. Main conclusions Habitat distribution models allowed accurate mapping of heath and shrub formations. The use of reflectance values as predictors improved the accuracy of the models, particularly for formations dominated by generalist species, supplying environmental information that was otherwise unavailable. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

However, modeling the stochastic behavior of analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits using MAXENT is still unknown. In this paper, we present a MAXENT based approach to efficiently model the arbitrary behavioral distribution of AMS circuits with high accuracy. The exact behavioral distribution can be approximated by a product of exponential functions with different Lagrangian multipliers. The closest approximation can be obtained by maximizing Shannon's information entropy subject to moment constraints, leading to a nonlinear system. Classic Newton's method is used to solve the nonlinear system for the Lagrangian multipliers, which can further recover the arbitrary behavioral distribution of AMS circuits. Extensive experiments on different circuits demonstrate that the proposed MAXENT based approach offers better stability and improves the accuracy up to 110{\%} when compared to previous AWE-based moment matching approaches, and offers up to 592x speedup when compared to Monte Carlo method. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Ecological niche models (ENMs) will successfully identify a species' ecological niche, provided that important assumptions are fulfilled, namely environment equilibrium and niche equality across the distribution. Violations may seriously affect ENM reliability, leading to erroneous biogeographic conclusions and inappropriate conservation prioritisation. We evaluate the robustness of ENMs against incomplete knowledge of distribution with a real example, the threatened Iberian lizard Podarcis carbonelli, whose distribution was gradually discovered over a long time period. We used several ENM methods for presence-only data (Maxent, ENFA, Bioclim, and Domain) to infer the realised ecological niche at two spatial resolutions (1 km and 200 m). The distribution data were split into four partial datasets corresponding to separate subranges: Central System (CS); Viseu-Aveiro (VA); Atlantic coast (AC); and Do{\~{n}}ana (DO). We then accumulated the datasets following the species discovery sequence: CS + VA, CS + VA + AC, and CS + VA + AC + DO. Niche equivalence and similarity between partial models were compared using Ecospat. ENMs were strongly affected by the violation of niche equilibrium; only the VA subrange forecasts the complete species range. ENMs were also sensitive to the violation of niche equality: only VA models were similar to the Iberian model, altitude being the most important variable followed by annual precipitation, maximum temperature in July, and annual radiation. When the ENMs were applied only to the first subrange discovered (CS), only the VA area was predicted, while the other subranges might have remained unknown, thus compromising conservation strategies. As assumptions of niche equilibrium and equality were violated, likely owing to the species' ecological multimodality, the models generated were biased and of limited predictive value. ENMs are useful tools in biogeography and conservation, but only if their basal assumptions are achieved. Partial models may be useful if they are considered as representing different suitable habitats. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS},

However, methods to properly assess priority protected areas (PPAs) that consider climate change have not been established. The distribution of Fraxinus mandshurica in northeast China was assessed, and our goal was to develop model-based strategies for the assessment of PPAs in consideration of climate change. To achieve this goal, we mapped the current and future suitable habitat distributions of F. mandshurica and planned PPAs based on 4 field surveys in northeast China. The models used in this study included a species distribution model (Maxent), systematic conservation planning model (Zonation), and geographic information system (ArcGIS 10.0). To promote sustainable development, the current and future suitable habitats of F. mandshurica must be integrated into the assessment of PPAs; however, the conservation areas of F. mandshurica in existing nature reserves cannot realize the conservation criterion of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC). In the eastern and northeastern regions of northeast China, the suitable habitats are predicted to migrate slightly northwards in the future. The methods used in this study are adequate for the assessment of PPAs and may provide a reference for the conservation and management of vulnerable plants. {\textcopyright} 2015, HARD Publishing Company.

We generated the model starting from a dataset of all locations where this species' presence was confirmed for the region of piedmont in 2004-2010, which consisted of only 15 occurrence records. To verify the working hypothesis that population survival is higher in areas where Maxent identifies higher distribution probability values, we used suitability indexes generated by the model to compare the "historical" (before 1980) and "recent" (1980-1996) distributions of P. f. insubricus populations in the piedmont region. The average area-under-the-curve value (0.878, s = 0.075) of the Maxent model proved significantly informative. Using the Bonferroni confidence interval, we demonstrated that surviving populations occupy geographic areas characterized by significantly higher potential suitability (p {\textless} 0.05), and we selected areas accordingly. We therefore conclude that, in our case study, modelling the distribution of rare species may represent a useful strategy to select areas where these species are likely to persist. To further evaluate this approach, we suggest testing it on the study of other rare species. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

We investigate niche differentiation of morphologically similar species using four sympatric macaque species in NNT NPA, as our model species: rhesus Macaca mulatta (Taxonomic Serial Number, TSN 180099), Northern pig-tailed M. leonina (TSN not listed); Assamese M. assamensis (TSN 573018) and stump-tailed M. arctoides (TSN 573017). We examine the implications for their conservation. We obtained occurrence data of macaque species from systematic 2006-2011 camera-trapping surveys and 2011-2012 transect surveys and model their niche and potential distribution with MaxEnt software using 25 environmental and topographic variables. The respective suitable habitat predicted for each species reveals niche segregation between the four species with a gradual geographical distribution following an environmental gradient within the study area. Camera-trapping positioned at many locations can increase elusive-species records with a relatively reduced and more systematic sampling effort and provide reliable species occurrence data. These can be used for environmental niche modelling to study niche segregation of morphologically similar species in areas where their distribution remains uncertain. Examining unresolved species' niches and potential distributions can have crucial implications for future research and species' management and conservation even in the most remote regions and for the least-known species. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Background: Ecological niche modeling is a method for estimation of species distributions based on certain ecological parameters. Thus far, empirical determination of significant differences between independently generated distribution maps for a single species (maps which are created through equivalent processes, but with different ecological input parameters), has been challenging. Results: We describe a method for comparing model outcomes, which allows a statistical evaluation of whether the strength of prediction and breadth of predicted areas is measurably different between projected distributions. To create ecological niche models for statistical comparison, we utilized GARP (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production) software to generate ecological niche models of human monkeypox in Africa. We created several models, keeping constant the case location input records for each model but varying the ecological input data. In order to assess the relative importance of each ecological parameter included in the development of the individual predicted distributions, we performed pixel-to-pixel comparisons between model outcomes and calculated the mean difference in pixel scores. We used a two sample Student's t-test, (assuming as null hypothesis that both maps were identical to each other regardless of which input parameters were used) to examine whether the mean difference in corresponding pixel scores from one map to another was greater than would be expected by chance alone. We also utilized weighted kappa statistics, frequency distributions, and percent difference to look at the disparities in pixel scores. Multiple independent statistical tests indicated precipitation as the single most important independent ecological parameter in the niche model for human monkeypox disease. Conclusion: In addition to improving our understanding of the natural factors influencing the distribution of human monkeypox disease, such pixel-to-pixel comparison tests afford users the ability to empirically distinguish the significance of each of the diverse environmental parameters included in the modeling process. This method will be particularly useful in situations where the outcomes (maps) appear similar upon visual inspection (as are generated with other modeling programs such as MAXENT), as it allows an investigator the capacity to explore subtle differences among ecological parameters and to demonstrate the individual importance of these factors within an overall model. {\textcopyright} 2009 Levine et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Customary medicinal plant species used by Australian Aborigines are disappearing rapidly with its associated knowledge, due to the loss of habitats. Conservation and protection of these species is important as they represent sources of novel therapeutic phytochemical compounds and are culturally valuable. Information on the spatial distribution and use of customary medicinal plants is often inadequate and fragmented, posing limitations on the identification and conservation of species-rich areas and culturally valuable habitats.In this study, the habitat suitability modeling program, MaxEnt, was used to predict the potential ecological niches of 431 customary medicinal plant species, based on bioclimatic variables. Specimen locality records were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data portal and from Australia's Virtual Herbarium (AVH).Ecological niche models of 414 predicted species, which had 30 or more occurrence points, were used to produce maps indicating areas that were ecologically suitable for multiple species (concordance of high predicted ecological suitability) and having cultural values. For the concordance map, individual species niche models were thresholded and summed. To derive a map of culturally valuable areas, customary medicinal uses from Customary Medicinal Knowledgebase (CMKb) (www.biolinfo.org/cmkb) were used to weight individual species models, resulting in a value within each grid cell reflecting its cultural worth.Even though the available information is scarce and fragmented, our approach provides an opportunity to infer areas predicted to be suitable for multiple species (i.e. concordance hotspots) and to estimate the cultural value of a particular geographical area. Our results also indicate that to conserve bio-cultural diversity, comprehensive information and active participation of Aboriginal communities is indispensable. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Geological and climatic changes associated with the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) have been suggested as drivers for biological diversification locally and in neighboring regions. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the niche evolution of Tripterospermum (Gentianaceae) and related Asian genera through time. METHODS: We conducted Species Distribution Modeling using Maximum Entropy Modeling (MaxEnt). Furthermore, we performed stochastic character mapping and produced disparity-through-time plots, and examined putative key innovations using the binary state speciation and extinction approach (BISSE). KEY RESULTS: Kuepferia and Sinogentiana prefer the coolest and driest habitat, having rather conserved niches. Despite a tendency for niche evolution, Crawfurdia and Metagentiana are probably restricted to a narrow distribution range because of their poor dispersal ability. In contrast, Tripterospermum has the broadest niche and occurs under the warmest and wettest conditions. A higher degree of niche evolution and a more efficient dispersal mechanism allowed this genus to diversify more and occupy a broader distribution range. CONCLUSIONS: The QTP genera producing dry capsules, whether displaying niche conservatism (Kuepferia and Sinogentiana) or a tendency for niche evolution (Crawfurdia and Metagentiana), are less species-rich and have a more restricted distribution than Tripterospermum (stronger niche evolution and berry-like fruits). The evolution of berry-like fruits corresponds to increased speciation rates, and could therefore be viewed as a key innovation. In contrast to the majority of studies on plants occurring around the QTP, we find that speciation was probably mediated by niche breadth and dispersal ability rather than geophysical changes. {\textcopyright} 2016 Botanical Society of America.},

abstract = {Invasive species are among the foremost threats to freshwater ecosystems. Predicting their spread is important, especially if the species is associated with undesirable effects on recipient ecosystems. Ecological niche modeling allows for the assessment of invasion potential of non-native species. Here, we used native and invasive occurrence locations and the Maxent niche modeling algorithm to predict the invasion potential of rusty crayfish, Orconectes rusticus Girard, 1852, in the United States. We built and compared three models based on:1) native occurrences only, 2) invasive occurrences only, and 3) all occurrence points. We found that the model using native occurrences did not accurately predict the current invasion of O. rusticus, as it omitted 58{\%} of the known invaded locations. Furthermore, the model based on invasive occurrences failed to accurately predict the native range of O. rusticus. Predicted suitable areas for O. rusticus closely matched the known distribution when all occurrences were used to train the Maxent model. Differences in models based on native and invasive occurrence points are likely due to a niche shift of O. rusticus during invasion. We recommend the use of multiple sources of information to better understand the invasion potential of invasive species, as solely using native or invasive occurrence information ultimately may provide inaccurate predictions about the spread of invasive species. {\textcopyright} The Crustacean Society, 2013.

abstract = {Knowledge of the distribution of plant species is essential for planning management and conservation actions, especially for economically important species. Available data on plant species in the Amazon usually do not represent their whole area of occurrence. The most widely used approach to infer predictions on species occurrence is niche modelling, which consists of correlating records of species with environmental conditions in their occurrence areas, generating maps with the potential distribution based on a combination of environmental features suitable for each species. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of modelling to improve knowledge on the distribution of six timber species and six palm trees in the Amazon, and whether these models can benefit from using data from field surveys added to those of biological collections. Models were generated using the Maxent algorithm. All models generated showed a low extrinsic omission rate (TOE) and AUC above 0.75. Areas predicted for timber species were more consistent with empirical knowledge than those predicted for palm trees, probably due to the greater amount of occurrence sites available for timber species, especially after adding data from field surveys. The extent of the predicted area and the Jaccard index were used to compare the maps after insertion of field survey data. There was a large difference in extent just for two species, one timber and one palm, and a reduction in the predicted area for one species, Swietenia macrophylla. The application of the Jaccard index resulted in values between 0.41 and 0.65 for timber species, reinforcing that the inclusion of field survey data changed predicted areas. For palms, the similar extent of predicted areas and Jaccard values above 0.80, indicated a subtle difference between maps generated before and after the inclusion of field survey records, probably due to the addition of fewer records. The exception was Astrocaryum murumuru, for which the new records increased the extent of the predicted area. The niche models associated with field studies can contribute enormously to increase knowledge concerning the current distribution of species, but new field surveys should be carefully designed to cover wide and undersampled areas. However, it is necessary to consider that this strategy can only be adopted for species with clearly distinctive features, for which field identifications are reliable. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Controlling such species requires a high input of effort and resources and therefore it is important to focus control on areas that will maximize gains for conservation. We present a spatial modelling approach that will help target control efforts. We used presence-only data to develop habitat suitability models for the invasive tree Casuarina equisetifolia and three endemic plant species on the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. Substantial overlap was found between suitable areas for the endemics and C. equisetifolia. Evidence for the potential harm that C. equisetifolia could cause to native vegetation was assessed using paired areas with and without invasion. Areas with C. equisetifolia present had lower native plant species richness than areas where it was absent, which suggests a negative effect of invasion on the growth of native plants. No endemic plants were found in areas where C. equisetifolia was present. Based on the data collected we recommend that the three endemic species be categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. By highlighting areas where the endemic plants are found and demonstrating a potential threat to these habitats, we provide a plan for the designation of six Important Plant Areas to promote conservation of these endemic species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Fauna {\&} Flora International.},

Species distribution models (SDMs) are central to extinction risk analyses. The reliability of predictions of SDMs has been questioned because models often lack a mechanistic underpinning and rely on assumptions that are untenable under climate change. We show how integrating predictions from fundamentally different modeling strategies produces robust forecasts of climate change impacts on habitat and population parameters. We illustrate the principle by applying mechanistic (Niche Mapper) and correlative (Maxent, Bioclim) SDMs to predict current and future distributions and fertility of an Australian gliding possum. The two approaches make congruent, accurate predictions of current distribution and similar, dire predictions about the impact of a warming scenario, supporting previous correlative-only predictions for similar species. We argue that convergent lines of independent evidence provide a robust basis for predicting and managing extinctions risks under climate change. {\textcopyright}2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Tibet makes up the majority of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, often referred to as the roof of the world. Its complex landforms, physiognomy, and climate create a special heterogeneous environment for mosses. Each moss species inhabits its own habitat and ecological niche. This, in combination with its sensitivity to environmental change, makes moss species distribution a useful indicator of vegetation alteration and climate change. This study aimed to characterize the diversity and distribution of Didymodon (Pottiaceae) in Tibet, and model the potential distribution of its species. A total of 221 sample plots, each with a size of 10 × 10 m and located at different altitudes, were investigated across all vegetation types. Of these, the 181 plots in which Didymodon species were found were used to conduct analyses and modeling. Three noteworthy results were obtained. First, a total of 22 species of Didymodon were identified. Among these, Didymodon rigidulusvar. subulatus had not previously been recorded in China, and Didymodon constrictusvar. constrictus was the dominant species. Second, analysis of the relationships between species distributions and environmental factors using canonical correspondence analysis revealed that vegetation cover and altitude were the main factors affecting the distribution of Didymodon in Tibet. Third, based on the environmental factors of bioclimate, topography and vegetation, the distribution of Didymodon was predicted throughout Tibet at a spatial resolution of 1 km, using the presence-only MaxEnt model. Climatic variables were the key factors in the model. We conclude that the environment plays a significant role in moss diversity and distribution. Based on our research findings, we recommend that future studies should focus on the impacts of climate change on the distribution and conservation of Didymodon. {\textcopyright} Copyright: {\textcopyright} 2015 Song et al.

It is urgent to analyse the potential geographic distribution of R. similis in China. Genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction modeling system (GARP) and maximum entropy (MAXENT), the two niche models which have been widely used to predict the potential geographic distribution of alien species, were used to predict the distribution of R. similis in China. We also presented a model comparison of the results by both threshold-dependent and threshold-independent evaluations. It has been shown that the two niche models could be used to predict the potential distribution of R. similis reliably. The potential distribution of R. similis should be constricted within the south of China, such as Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan provinces, and Taiwan of China. The MAXENT gives a better prediction than that of GARP. R. similis can be introduced to China by flowers and nursery stock's international shipping. The predicted results indicate that R. similis can occur in south coastal area of China and Yunnan Province, which are the main flower and nursery stock's import-export areas in China. Consequently, a strong quarantine program is needed at the ports of such areas to prevent the pest from being introduced to China. {\textcopyright} 2007 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.},

Designing new conservation units and potential corridors are therefore crucial for the long-term survival of the species within the Caatinga biome. Thus, our aims were: 1) to recognize suitable areas for jaguar occurrence, 2) to delineate areas for jaguar conservation (PJCUs), 3) to design corridors among priority areas, and 4) to prioritize PJCUs. A total of 62 points records of jaguar occurrence and 10 potential predictors were analyzed in a GIS environment. A predictive distributional map was obtained using Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) as performed by the Maximum Entropy (Maxent) algorithm. Areas equal to or higher than the median suitability value of 0.595 were selected as of high suitability for jaguar occurrence and named as Priority Jaguar Conservation Units (PJCU). Ten PJCUs with sizes varying from 23.6 km2 to 4,311.0 km2 were identified. Afterwards, we combined the response curve, as generated by SDM, and expert opinions to create a permeability matrix and to identify least cost corridors and buffer zones between each PJCU pair. Connectivity corridors and buffer zone for jaguar movement included an area of 8.884,26 km2 and the total corridor length is about 160.94 km. Prioritizing criteria indicated the PJCU representing c.a. 68.61{\%} of the total PJCU area (PJCU {\#} 1) as of high priority for conservation and connectivity with others PJCUs (PJCUs {\#} 4, 5 and 7) desirable for the long term survival of the species. In conclusion, by using the jaguar as a focal species and combining SDM and expert opinion we were able to create a valid framework for practical conservation actions at the Caatinga biome. The same approach could be used for the conservation of other carnivores. {\textcopyright} 2014 Morato et al.},

abstract = {Aim Using predictive species distribution and ecological niche modelling our objectives are: (1) to identify important climatic drivers of distribution at regional scales of a locally complex and dynamic system - California sage scrub; (2) to map suitable sage scrub habitat in California; and (3) to distinguish between bioclimatic niches of floristic groups within sage scrub to assess the conservation significance of analysing such species groups. Location Coastal mediterranean-type shrublands of southern and central California. Methods Using point localities from georeferenced herbarium records, we modelled the potential distribution and bioclimatic envelopes of 14 characteristic sage scrub species and three floristic groups (south-coastal, coastal-interior disjunct and broadly distributed species) based upon current climate conditions. Maxent was used to map climatically suitable habitat, while principal components analysis followed by canonical discriminant analysis were used to distinguish between floristic groups and visualize species and group distributions in multivariate ecological space. Results Geographical distribution patterns of individual species were mirrored in the habitat suitability maps of floristic groups, notably the disjunct distribution of the coastal-interior species. Overlap in the distributions of floristic groups was evident in both geographical and multivariate niche space; however, discriminant analysis confirmed the separability of floristic groups based on bioclimatic variables. Higher performance of floristic group models compared with sage scrub as a whole suggests that groups have differing climate requirements for habitat suitability at regional scales and that breaking sage scrub into floristic groups improves the discrimination between climatically suitable and unsuitable habitat. Main conclusions The finding that presence-only data and climatic variables can produce useful information on habitat suitability of California sage scrub species and floristic groups at a regional scale has important implications for ongoing efforts of habitat restoration for sage scrub. In addition, modelling at a group level provides important information about the differences in climatic niches within California sage scrub. Finally, the high performance of our floristic group models highlights the potential a community-level modelling approach holds for investigating plant distribution patterns. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Reliable yield assessments with conventional methods require agroclimatic and physiological knowledge, which is not yet available for Jatropha. To fill this gap, we tested a novel two-step approach integrating knowledge from biogeography and population biology with available Jatropha field data. In the first step, using MaxEnt, a widely implemented model in biogeography, we predicted Jatropha fitness in response to climate by relating natural occurrence recorded in herbaria with bioclimatic geodatasets. In the second step, we relied on population biology principles supported by seed mass addition experiments to relate fitness to reproductive potential, hence seed yield. Jatropha seed yield in response to climate was mapped worldwide for actual (1950-2000 average) and future (2020) climate conditions. The modelled Jatropha seed yield was validated against a set of on-field yield assessments (R2=0.67, P{\textless}0.001). The discrepancies between estimated and measured yields were partially explained by model uncertainties, as quantified by the sensitivity analysis of our modelling (R2=0.57, P=0.001). Jatropha has a pan-tropical distribution, plus specific adaptability to hot temperate areas. Climate variables most significantly affecting modelled yield response were annual average temperature, minimum temperature, annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Studies dealing with changes of biodiversity in time and space constitute an important part of biogeography, ecology and conservation biology. Areas of long-term climate stability are particularly interesting as they might have facilitated the survival of species over historical times and thus are crucial for understanding contemporary diversity patterns. In this study, we assessed the potential distribution of 23 estrildid finch species in order to analyse stability in recent and past diversity patterns and diversity centres in the Austral-Asiatic region. We used Maxent to predict recent distributions of each species and to project them onto the climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21 000 yr BP) using two different scenarios (CCSM, MIROC). The resulting diversity patterns were tested on presence and possible shifts of distribution centres. Diversity patterns of forest- and savannah-living species were considered combined and separately. During the LGM, potential diversity patterns of forest-living species corroborated well with postulated rainforest refuges situated on the eastern coast of Cape York Peninsula. Our results indicate a remarkably high stability of existing diversity centres. Although projections into the past show some differences in detail in the extent and exact position of the diversity centres, they reveal largely congruent large scale patterns in both time slices. However, the models suggest a northward shift towards exposed continental shelf areas that where dry during the LGM. Clearly, centres of diversity were situated on this land bridge between Australia and New Guinea, highlighting their importance as areas of retreat for estrildid finches and maybe other savannah species in times of changing climatic conditions and associated sea-level fluctuations. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

Using a dated phylogeny, we regressed the proportion of unfilled potential range on lineage age. To compare our predictions we also regressed realized range size on lineage age. Results: Unfilled potential range was weakly associated with lineage age. This relationship was an inverse function of lineage age, explaining between 0 and 17{\%} of the proportion of unfilled potential range. Furthermore, the relationship between realized range size and lineage age exhibited a logarithmic function, with lineage age explaining between 13 and 20{\%} of the variation in realized range size. Main conclusions: Different regression models indicated that old phyllostomid species have smaller unfilled ranges than young species. That is, old species have filled most of the areas that are suitable for them. Furthermore, old species have larger realized ranges than young species. We thus refuted both the lineage age-area and taxon cycle models and lent support to the stasis post-expansion model. This suggests that bat species can reach most of their potential range rapidly after cladogenesis and such occupation remains more or less constant through time. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

We predict the potential habitat of H. leuconedys in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, India, using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) distribution modelling algorithm. The model was developed using 90 known localities of H. leuconedys in the state. Nineteen environmental parameters along with 12 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) layers, elevation and land use and land cover (LULC) were used in the modelling. Amongst the environmental input variables, the precipitation of the coldest quarter (BIO 19) had the highest contribution to the model (26.03{\%}) and the twelve NDVI layers collectively contributed 60.91{\%}. Two districts, Lower Dibang Valley and Lohit, which are known to contain H. leuconedys, occupied 64.75{\%} of the predicted distribution area of the species. Thus, we aid in the identification of suitable areas for the reintroduction program of H. leuconedys that is planned by the Gibbon Conservation Breeding Centre, Biological Park, Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh, India. {\textcopyright} 2015 S.

abstract = {The distribution patterns of the freshwater fish within Tabasco wetlands have not being yet studied at a regional scale. We implemented an ecological niche modeling approach to: 1) identify the potential richness distribution patterns of native fish; 2) evaluate the relative importance of climatic and topographic variables in fish distribution, and 3) analyze if the natural protected areas correspond to areas with higher potential species richness. We used occurrence records of 41 native fish species and 22 interpolated surfaces that represent topographic features and annual, seasonal and extreme trends of temperature and precipitation to generate niche-based potential geographic distribution maps using the GARP and MaxEnt algorithms. Our results show that habitat affinities can be detected at the regional scale using macro-climatic and topographic variables. Despite the apparent evenness of the system, species' distributions were not homogenous at the regional scale. The classification tree analysis showed that the mean temperature of the driest quarter was the most influential variable for clustering species. We found that areas with the highest potential species richness are not included in the natural protected areas network. This information can be used for the development of new and better native fish conservation strategies, like expanding the current ones or establishing new natural protected areas. {\textcopyright} 2017 Universidad Nacional Aut{\'{o}}noma de M{\'{e}}xico, Instituto de Biolog{\'{i}}a},

Characterizing WNV vector habitat requirements allows for the identification of areas at risk of viral amplification and transmission. Maxent-based ecological niche models were developed using literature records of 13 potential WNV Italian vector mosquito species to predict their habitat suitability range and to investigate possible geographical associations with WNV equine outbreak occurrence in Italy from 2008 to 2010. The contribution of different environmental variables to the niche models was also assessed. Suitable habitats for Culex pipiens, Aedes albopictus, and Anopheles maculipennis were widely distributed; Culex modestus, Ochlerotatus geniculatus, Ochlerotatus caspius, Coquillettidia richiardii, Aedes vexans, and Anopheles plumbeus were concentrated in north-central Italy; Aedes cinereus, Culex theileri, Ochlerotatus dorsalis, and Culiseta longiareolata were restricted to coastal/southern areas. Elevation, temperature, and precipitation variables showed the highest predictive power. Host population and landscape variables provided minor contributions. WNV equine outbreaks had a significantly higher probability to occur in habitats suitable for Cx. modestus and Cx. pipiens, providing circumstantial evidence that the potential distribution of these two species coincides geographically with the observed distribution of the disease in equines. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Association for Ecology and Health.},

abstract = {Aim: To investigate how Quaternary climatic changes affected the habitats that support endemic tree species distributions in a tropical rain forest. Based on past and present predicted species distributions, we assessed (1) whether climatic conditions may have supported species survival in the same area over the studied period, (2) the effect of ecological niche specialization on species-specific responses, and (3) the persistence of current populations in areas that were more climatically stable over time. Location: Western Ghats, Western Ghats-Sri Lanka Biodiversity Hotspot, India. Methods: We assessed species' current bioclimatic preferences based on their occurrence data using Maxent distribution modelling. The models were projected onto past climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Last Interglacial (LIG) to assess the extent of changes in species' predicted distributions through time. Further, we tested whether species' current occurrences were located non-randomly in pixels predicted to have been suitable in the past. Finally, we characterized species-specific responses in relation to plausible biogeographical scenarios. Results: We identified three distinct scenarios of species' responses to past climate changes - stability, contraction and shift - depending on their bioclimatic preferences. For high-elevation species, the cool, dry LGM was less restrictive than for medium-elevation and northern lowland species. Southernmost species requiring minimal seasonality were restricted by higher LIG seasonality, and only predicted to have been present in Sri Lanka at that time. Barring these southernmost narrow endemics, past suitable habitat, within which observed current occurrences are located, were predicted for most species. Main conclusions: Palaeoclimate modelling reveals the likely local persistence of most Western Ghats endemics over the last 150 kyr, a relatively recent period in this Paleogene refugium. The large spectrum of bioclimatic preferences probably arose as a result of evolutionary events prior to the Quaternary. Our results highlight the need for further studies based on molecular phylogenetics in this relatively poorly studied biodiversity hotspot. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd..},

abstract = {Aim: Using the rock-specialist agamid Ctenophorus caudicinctus as a model, we test hypothesized biogeographical dispersal corridors for lizards in the Australian arid zone (across the western sand deserts), and assess how these dispersal routes have shaped phylogeographical structuring. Location: Arid and semi-arid Australia. Methods: We sequenced a c. 1400 bp fragment of mtDNA (ND2) for 134 individuals of C. caudicinctus as well as a subset of each of the mtDNA clades for five nuclear loci (BDNF, BACH1, GAPD, NTF3, and PRLR). We used phylogenetic methods to assess biogeographical patterns within C. caudicinctus, including relaxed molecular clock analyses to estimate divergence times. Ecological niche modelling (Maxent) was employed to estimate the current distribution of suitable climatic envelopes for each lineage. Results: Phylogenetic analyses identified two deeply divergent mtDNA clades within C. caudicinctus – an eastern and western clade – separated by the Western Australian sand deserts. However, divergences pre-date the Pleistocene sand deserts. Phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear DNA data sets generally support major mtDNA clades, suggesting past connections between the western C. c. caudicinctus populations in far eastern Pilbara (EP) and the lineages to the east of the sand deserts. Ecological niche modelling supports the continued suitability of climatic conditions between the Central Ranges and the far EP for C. c. graafi. Main conclusions: Estimates of lineage ages provide evidence of divergence between eastern and western clades during the Miocene with subsequent secondary contact during the Pliocene. Our results suggest that this secondary contact occurred via dispersal between the Central Ranges and the far EP, rather than the more southerly Giles Corridor. These events precede the origins of the western sand deserts and divergence patterns instead appear associated with Miocene and Pliocene climate change. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Habitat protection is a strategy often proposed in fisheries management to help maintain viable populations of exploited species. Yet, quantifying the importance of habitat availability for population sizes is difficult, as the precise distribution of essential habitats is poorly known. To quantify the contribution from coastal nursery habitats to exploited fish population sizes, we related adult density to the amount of nursery habitat available for 12 populations of the two dominant predatory fish species in a 40 000-km 2 archipelago area of the Baltic Sea. Habitat distribution was mapped using three conceptually different techniques, Maxent, generalized additive models, and random forest, using spawning and 0-group point samples. Adult densities were estimated from gillnet surveys. Regressions demonstrated no evident effect from fishing, whereas habitat availability had a positive effect, explaining almost half of the variation in population sizes of both species. This result shows that a substantial proportion of the potential production of adult fish can be estimated by mapping essential nursery habitats distribution. Responses were non-linear, indicating that habitat protection has largest effects where there is little available habitat. By demonstrating the importance of habitat limitation of two exploited fish species, we provide quantitative support to the benefits of habitat protection for fisheries. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {Aim: Ecological niche modelling is one of the main tools that allows for the incorporation of climate change effects into conservation planning. For example, ecological niche model predictions can be used to rank species by degree of predicted future habitat loss. While many studies have considered how different modelling decisions contribute to uncertainty in niche model outputs, here we evaluate how metrics used to rank species by conservation risk respond to the choice of global climate models, greenhouse gas emission scenarios, suitable versus unsuitable threshold values, and the degree of model complexity. Location: California, USA. Methods: We built ecological niche models for 153 species of reptiles and amphibians. Reduced complexity models were compared to default complexity models using AICc to select climate variables and tune Maxent' s built-in regularization parameter. We predicted the distribution of climatically suitable habitat under future (2041-2060) climate conditions according to 11 global climate models, four representative concentration pathways, and three threshold values. Two metrics to rank species by predicted future loss of climatically suitable habitat were calculated for each set of modelling decisions. To determine the effects of modelling decisions on rankings, we used mixed models. Results: Our results indicate that while individual modelling decisions had relatively small effects on species ranks alone, in combination, they lead to very different conservation assessments. Main conclusions: We recommend that a wide range of modelling decisions be explored and that variation in ranks across runs be reported as a first step in identifying the uncertainty in rank metrics used for assessing conservation risk under changing, but uncertain climate predictions. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

These species are considered to play an important role in the transmission and persistence of MTC in cattle in some regions; however the factors contributing to the risk of transmission at the wildlife-livestock interface and the areas at highest risk for such transmission are largely unknown. This study sought to identify geographic areas where wildlife-livestock interactions are most likely to occur and to characterize the environmental and management factors at this interface contributing to persistence, incidence, and occurrence of TB on cattle farms, in one of the provinces with higher TB prevalence in Spain, Ciudad Real. We used spatially explicit, ecological niche models to evaluate the importance of factors such as wildlife demographics and hunting management, land use, climatic, and environmental variables as well as TB status in wildlife for TB breakdown (model 1), persistence (model 2) and new infection (model 3) on cattle farms and to generate high resolution maps of predicted TB occurrence to guide risk-based interventions. Models revealed that land use, particularly open area and woodland, high wild boar TB prevalence, and close proximity to fenced hunting estates were the most important factors associated with TB infection on cattle farms. This is the first time that local TB prevalence in wild boar for individual hunting estates has been significantly associated with TB occurrence on cattle farms at a local scale. Prediction maps identified two areas with high likelihood of TB occurrence in the southwest and northwest of the province where wildlife-livestock interactions and TB occurrence are highly likely and where TB preventative and mitigation strategies (e.g. targeted vaccination, increased biosecurity, etc.) should be prioritized. Methods and results of this study were aimed to inform the implementation of risk-based interventions to better prevent and control TB at the wildlife-livestock interface, a necessary step for the successful eradication of TB in cattle in Spain. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, a species distribution model was used to explore the effects of potential climate change scenarios on the distribution of the wart-biter bush cricket. The model predicts that suitable habitat will shift towards the north and to higher altitudes under a moderate climate change scenario, and that under severe climate change, the cricket will be left with very little suitable habitat in Europe. This highlights the threat of climate change to the species, but also the importance of maintaining the current habitat in the northern and high altitude areas of its range, as these areas may become important strongholds for the species in the future. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

The tree has been experiencing population decline throughout its native ranges due to overgrazing, attack by pathogens, human overexploitation, and climate change. The conservation actions for this tree are hindered due to poor information on its geographical distribution. Using published occurrence data, current and future distribution of D. ombet under climate change was predicted in the present study using MaxEnt. The model performed better than random with area under the curve and true skill statistical values were 0.979 ± 0.034 and 0.724 ± 0.419, respectively. The tree was predicted to be found on mountain chain around the Red Sea with slope and precipitation being the most influential factors. Future prediction of D. ombet showed major loss of habitat in Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan. In Saudi Arabia, however, most of the population could deal with future climate and some population even could expand their ranges to higher latitude.

abstract = {Vector borne diseases are susceptible to climate change because distributions and densities of many vectors are climate driven. The Amazon region is endemic for cutaneous leishmaniasis and is predicted to be severely impacted by climate change. Recent records suggest that the distributions of Lutzomyia (Nyssomyia) flaviscutellata and the parasite it transmits, Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis, are expanding southward, possibly due to climate change, and sometimes associated with new human infection cases. We define the vector's climatic niche and explore future projections under climate change scenarios. Vector occurrence records were compiled from the literature, museum collections and Brazilian Health Departments. Six bioclimatic variables were used as predictors in six ecological niche model algorithms (BIOCLIM, DOMAIN, MaxEnt, GARP, logistic regression and Random Forest). Projections for 2050 used 17 general circulation models in two greenhouse gas representative concentration pathways: "stabilization" and "high increase". Ensemble models and consensus maps were produced by overlapping binary predictions. Final model outputs showed good performance and significance. The use of species absence data substantially improved model performance. Currently, L. flaviscutellata is widely distributed in the Amazon region, with records in the Atlantic Forest and savannah regions of Central Brazil. Future projections indicate expansion of the climatically suitable area for the vector in both scenarios, towards higher latitudes and elevations. L. flaviscutellata is likely to find increasingly suitable conditions for its expansion into areas where human population size and density are much larger than they are in its current locations. If environmental conditions change as predicted, the range of the vector is likely to expand to southeastern and central-southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and further into the Amazonian areas of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. These areas will only become endemic for L. amazonensis, however, if they have competent reservoir hosts and transmission dynamics matching those in the Amazon region. {\textcopyright} 2015 Carvalho et al.

The European distribution of the Mediterranean stripe-necked terrapin (Mauremys leprosa) is restricted to the Iberian Peninsula and a small area in southern France. The species is considered common in Spain and Portugal but has shown a decrease in its distribution and population density though most of the Iberian Peninsula, other than the Catalonia region in the northeast. The main objective of this work was to use ecological niche modelling to evaluate trends in the status of M. leprosa in the Catalonia region. Species distribution has increased over time from coastal to inland areas. The maximum altitude of the species in the study area increased throughout the three time periods studied. M. leprosa is becoming more common with less isolated populations. Realised niche models indicated that M. leprosa preferred wetlands and water bodies, artificial surfaces and agricultural areas up to 900 m with sunny orientations. In regards to climatic preferences, M. leprosa is a thermophilous species that, unlike other native freshwater European turtles, shows some tolerance for habitat disturbance. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract = {Climate is a major factor delimiting species' distributions. However, biotic interactions may also be prominent in shaping geographical ranges, especially for parapatric species forming hybrid zones. Determining the relative effect of each factor and their interaction of the contact zone location has been difficult due to the lack of broad scale environmental data. Recent developments in species distribution modelling (SDM) now allow disentangling the relative contributions of climate and species' interactions in hybrid zones and their responses to future climate change. We investigated the moving hybrid zone between the breeding ranges of two parapatric passerines in Europe. We conducted SDMs representing the climatic conditions during the breeding season. Our results show a large mismatch between the realized and potential distributions of the two species, suggesting that interspecific interactions, not climate, account for the present location of the contact zone. The SDM scenarios show that the southerly distributed species, Hippolais polyglotta, might lose large parts of its southern distribution under climate change, but a similar gain of novel habitat along the hybrid zone seems unlikely, because interactions with the other species (H. icterina) constrain its range expansion. Thus, whenever biotic interactions limit range expansion, species may become 'trapped' if range loss due to climate change is faster than the movement of the contact zone. An increasing number of moving hybrid zones are being reported, but the proximate causes of movement often remain unclear. In a global context of climate change, we call for more interest in their interactions with climate change. {\textcopyright} 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

abstract = {Biologic control of the introduced and invasive, woody plant tamarisk (Tamarix spp, saltcedar) in south-western states is controversial because it affects habitat of the federally endangered South-western Willow Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus). These songbirds sometimes nest in tamarisk where floodplain-level invasion replaces native habitats. Biologic control, with the saltcedar leaf beetle (Diorhabda elongate), began along the Virgin River, Utah, in 2006, enhancing the need for comprehensive understanding of the tamarisk-flycatcher relationship. We used maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling to separately quantify the current extent of dense tamarisk habitat ({\textgreater}50{\%} cover) and the potential extent of habitat available for E. traillii extimus within the studied watersheds. We used transformations of 2008 Landsat Thematic Mapper images and a digital elevation model as environmental input variables. Maxent models performed well for the flycatcher and tamarisk with Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) values of 0.960 and 0.982, respectively. Classification of thresholds and comparison of the two Maxent outputs indicated moderate spatial overlap between predicted suitable habitat for E. traillii extimus and predicted locations with dense tamarisk stands, where flycatcher habitat will potentially change flycatcher habitats. Dense tamarisk habitat comprised 500 km 2 within the study area, of which 11.4{\%} was also modeled as potential habitat for E. traillii extimus. Potential habitat modeled for the flycatcher constituted 190 km 2, of which 30.7{\%} also contained dense tamarisk habitat. Results showed that both native vegetation and dense tamarisk habitats exist in the study area and that most tamarisk infestations do not contain characteristics that satisfy the habitat requirements of E. traillii extimus. Based on this study, effective biologic control of Tamarix spp. may, in the short term, reduce suitable habitat available to E. traillii extimus, but also has the potential in the long term to increase suitable habitat if appropriate mixes of native woody vegetation replace tamarisk in biocontrol areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have become increasingly useful for conservation issues. Initially designed to predict distributions of species from incomplete datasets, SDMs may also identify environmental conditions associated with higher occurrences and abundances of widely distributed taxa. Using sighting records of 15 widely distributed mammals from French Guiana, including primates, carnivores, rodents and ungulates, we used three SDMs --based on (i) entropy, (ii) genetic algorithm, (iii) Mahalanobis distance -- to investigate relationships between species occurrence and predictive variables such as vegetation, biogeographic units, climate, and disturbance index. Maximal entropy procedures resulted in more accurate projected conditions: the accuracy of the predicted distributions was higher than 90{\%} in nine species among the 15 tested, and predicted occurrences were correlated to fieldmeasured abundances for nine species. The Genetic algorithm implemented with GARP had lower accuracy, with predicted occurrences correlated to abundances for three species only. Finally, Mahalanobis distance had a much lower performance and failed to find any correlation between occurrences and abundances. In the case of MaxEnt modelling, since map projection summarized more appropriate environmental conditions and identified areas likely to act as sources and/or corridors, we propose to use those appropriate environmental conditions as a proxy of conductance for landscape connectivity planning. We provide evidence here that SDMs can identify not only more suitable environmental conditions, but also areas hosting higher abundances for a large set of species with key ecological roles. Further management applications of this environmental suitability index could help in designing corridors between protected areas. {\textcopyright} Luc Cl{\'{e}}ment, Fran{\c{c}}ois Catzeflis, C{\'{e}}cile Richard-Hansen, S{\'{e}}bastien Barrioz, Benoit de Thoisy.},

Zhalong Nature Reserve is one of the main breeding sites of the western group red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis) migratory population, with a large, dynamic breeding population. With the objective of predicting the nesting habitat of red-crowned crane in Zhalong Nature Reserve, we obtained nesting occurrence records for this species from the study area collected from 2012-2013, extracted the environmental factors from the thematic mapper (TM) image of Zhalong Nature Reserve in 2013. We analyzed the nesting habitat suitability of red-crowned crane by the combined use of a GIS and MAXENT model. The results showed that the accuracy of the MAXENT model was excellent (training data area under the curve=0.901). The greenness vegetation index (34.9{\%}), man-made interference (namely, the distance to frequently disturbed zones from human activity, 17.1{\%}), soil wetness index (16.3{\%}), and elevation (15.7{\%}) were the main environmental factors influencing the nesting habitat selection of red-crowned crane. The central and south regions of the core zone were the main suitable nesting zones, and there was a small area of suitable habitat in the buffer zone and the experimental zone; the suitable nesting habitat area was 35857.35 hm2, representing about 17.07{\%} of the whole reserve. The results showed that the core zone is the most important management zone for red-crowned crane nesting, and the reserve should also pay more attention to the small reed marsh area in the buffer zone and the experimental zone. {\textcopyright} 2016, Ecological Society of China.

abstract = {Habitat suitability models are based on digital maps that very often describe the environment at a human scale and, hence miss ecological structures and features that are important for wildlife. LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data, laser scanning acquired by remote sensing, can fill this gap by providing useful information not only on the spatial extent of habitat types but also information on the vertical height. The advantage of LiDAR derived variables lays also in the availability at a large scale, instead of just in the survey sites. In this work we evaluated the effect of three LiDAR derived variables (tree height, percentage of trees in open areas and length of ecotone) on the performance of habitat models, developed for four farmland bird species. For each species multiple runs of stepwise Logistic Regression (LR) and Maximum Entropy Models (Maxent) were performed. For each run we included and excluded the LiDAR variables and recorded the improvement in model performance using the AUC, AIC, Sensitivity, Specificity. Model results were applied in a GIS in order to create habitat suitability maps. Results for the RL models showed that for most of the species at least one LiDAR variable was selected and significant (p{\textless} 0.05). Additionally the inclusion LIDAR data gave a positive percentage of contribution to the AUC of the Maxent models. The models calculated using LiDAR derived variables identified a smaller area on the map, with a better overlap with open areas, thus showing a more realistic spatial pattern. The interpretation of these variable is also more straightforward, both from the ecological point of view and when defining management guidelines. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The aims of the study were to generate habitat suitability models for 19 common small mammal species in order to 1) compare two approaches to eliminate the effect of sampling bias and spatial autocorrelation, 2) choose the best model and provide accurate high resolution habitat suitability maps, 3) examine the obtained relationships within the context of ecological realism of the models, and 4) evaluate the potential of satellite imagery in the modelling process. The models were fitted using three different sets: (1) all data (ID-models); (2) by using spatial bias file (MBD-models); and (3) spatial filtering (SF-models). Although MBD- and SF- models showed lower performance statistics they produced ecologically more reliable habitat suitability maps than ID-models, especially for widely distributed species. MBD-models produced an optimal output that provides the maximal explanation of input data while still maintaining generality. Models based on this approach were chosen to produce the final maps. According to the AUC values of test partition, 6 models were fair, 7 were good, and 6 were excellent. Across all fitted models, the highest percentage contribution was on average for altitude, which had a contribution of 54.3{\%}, followed by the PC1 of reflectance data (9.9{\%}), topographic wetness index (7.1{\%}), aspect (6.9{\%}), PC2 (4.9{\%}), slope (3.4{\%}), and PC3 (2.0{\%}). The species-environment relationships registered by the models corresponded very well to the known ecology of the studied species. It was shown that raw Landsat ETM+ data integrated with topographical variables have the potential to produce models that have a high degree of ecological realism and reflect both the general type of distribution of each species in the country, and peculiarities associated with fine scale local conditions. In this sense satellite data can be regarded as especially suitable for modelling small and less mobile animals. {\textcopyright} 2015, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

The explicit modelling of the biodiversity in response to climate change is the primary requirement for making any adaptation strategy. With Himalayan ecosystem in mind and Rhododendron as the species of concern, the current paper models the biogeography of the genera Rhododendron which are found intermixed in their spatial distribution in Sikkim Himalayas, mainly tree varieties, in response to climate change. The modelling algorithm used in the paper is Maxent (maximum entropy) which has estimated the target probability distribution by finding the probability distribution of Maxent. After projection of modelled bioclimatic layers to future climate scenario of SRES-A1B in Maxent, it was found that the suitable bioclimatic envelope for Rhododendron has shrunk considerably under the envisaged climate change scenario. The results on extent and locations of Rhododendron distributions in both the current and future climate scenarios provide a deep insight to the conservation planners about the kind of strategy that needs to be adopted for conserving Rhododendrons in the face of climate change.

abstract = {Aim We use novel data on the occurrence of the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in Costa Rica to model its potential distribution in that country. Location Lowland and montane areas of Costa Rica. Methods We use published and new data on the presence of B. dendrobatidis on 647 amphibians (35 species). Screening was performed through histological techniques by which 156 sites were surveyed. Of these, 21 were found to have the amphibian chytrid. Maxent, a presence-only distribution modelling technique, was used to create 100 predictions of B. dendrobatidis occurrence, of which the most accurate 10 (based on area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve) were chosen to create a composite distribution model. This approach increased confidence in model predictions, distinguishing areas of high probability of occurrence and low variability across model runs (higher confidence) from those with high probability but high variability (lower confidence). Results Predicted distribution patterns were not uniform along Costa Rica's mountains, where most amphibian declines have occurred. The pathogen was predicted to occur with greater probability on the Caribbean slopes than on the Pacific slopes. While high temperature seems to constrain the distribution of the pathogen, areas that also have small amounts of rainfall during the driest period of the year were predicted to have low probability of B. dendrobatidis occurrence. Main conclusions The model predicts that the Santa Elena Peninsula and the Central Valley have low probabilities of B. dendrobatidis occurrence, suggesting that they could function as refuges for amphibians. In such refugial areas, one could expect B. dendrobatidis to be absent, or to be present in low abundance (rendering an epidemic outbreak of chytridiomycosis unlikely). Craugastor ranoides, which belongs to a group of frogs particularly sensitive to chytridiomycosis outbreaks, persists in the hot and seasonally dry Santa Elena Peninsula but disappeared in the nearby colder and more humid Guanacaste Volcanic Chain. This information suggests that climatic refuges, where environmental conditions prevent disease outbreaks, could be an important component in amphibian conservation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Summary: Flying foxes Pteropus spp. play a key role in forest regeneration as seed dispersers and are also the reservoir of many viruses, including Nipah virus in Bangladesh. Little is known about their habitat requirements, particularly in South Asia. Identifying Pteropus habitat preferences could assist in understanding the risk of zoonotic disease transmission broadly and, in Bangladesh, could help explain the spatial distribution of human Nipah virus cases. We analysed characteristics of Pteropus giganteus roosts and constructed an ecological niche model to identify suitable habitat in Bangladesh. We also assessed the distribution of suitable habitat in relation to the location of human Nipah virus cases. Compared to non-roost trees, P. giganteus roost trees are taller with larger diameters and are more frequently canopy trees. Colony size was larger in densely forested regions and smaller in flood-affected areas. Roosts were located in areas with lower annual precipitation and higher human population density than non-roost sites. We predicted that 2-17{\%} of Bangladesh's land area is suitable roosting habitat. Nipah virus outbreak villages were 2{\textperiodcentered}6 times more likely to be located in areas predicted as highly suitable habitat for P. giganteus compared to non-outbreak villages. Synthesis and applications. Habitat suitability modelling may help identify previously undocumented Nipah outbreak locations and improve our understanding of Nipah virus ecology by highlighting regions where there is suitable bat habitat but no reported human Nipah virus. Conservation and public health education is a key component of P. giganteus management in Bangladesh due to the general misunderstanding and fear of bats that are a reservoir of Nipah virus. Affiliation between Old World fruit bats (Pteropodidae) and people is common throughout their range, and in order to conserve these keystone bat species and prevent emergence of zoonotic viruses, it is imperative that we continue to improve our understanding of Pteropus resource requirements and routes of virus transmission from bats to people. Results presented here can be utilized to develop land management strategies and conservation policies that simultaneously protect fruit bats and public health. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

Our goals were to: (1) identify the predictors that have the largest influence in determining livestock kills, (2) assess the influence of scale across the different predictors evaluated and identify the scale at which each was most important. Methods: We used livestock kills obtained from compensation records of tiger (n = 326) and leopard (n = 377) across Bhutan between 2003 and 2012 to run predation risk models with MaxEnt algorithm, using a multi-scale modeling approach (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 km). Results: Human-presence (density of settlements and roads) and land-cover (percentage of tree cover and meadow patches) were the main variables contributing to livestock kills by both species. Livestock kills were likely driven by a trade-off between livestock density and predator ecology, and the balance of this trade-off varied with scale. Risk maps revealed different hotspots for tiger and leopard kills, and analysis showed both species preferentially killed equids over other livestock types. Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of evaluating scale when investigating the spatial attributes of livestock kills by tiger and leopard. Our findings provide guidance for reducing conflict between humans and large felids throughout the country. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Question: Which is the best model to predict the habitat distribution of Buxus balearica Lam. in southern Spain? Location: M{\'{a}}laga and Granada, Spain, across an area of 38180km2. Methods: Prediction models based on 17 environmental variables were tested. Six methods were compared: multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), maximum entropy approach to modelling species' distributions (Maxent), two generic algorithms based on environmental metrics dissimilarity (BIOCLIM and DOMAIN), Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP), and supervised learning methods based on generalized linear classifiers (support vector machines, SVMs). To test the predictive power of the models we used the Kappa index. Results: Maxent most accurately predicted the habitat distribution of B. balearica, followed by MARS models. The other models tested yielded lower accuracy values. A comparison of the predictive power of the models revealed that climate variables made the highest contributions among the environmental variables studied. The variables that made the lowest contributions were the insolation models. To examine the sensitivity of the models to a reduction in the number of variables, a test showed that accuracy of over 0.90 was maintained by applying just three climatic variables (spring rainfall, mean temperature of the warmest month, and mean temperature of the coldest month). Maps derived from the algorithms of all models tested coincided well with the known distribution of the species. Conclusions: Model habitat prediction is a preliminary step towards highlighting areas of high habitat suitability of B. balearica. These data support the results of previous research, which show that MaxEnt is the best technique for modelling species distributions with small sample sizes. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

The work presented in this paper combined import statistics of deciduous wood chips, Maximum entropy modelling (MaxEnt) of climatic similarities, and the distribution of potential tree hosts to predict the likelihood of four selected North American Agrilus species to become introduced and established in Europe. In agreement with the EU's energy-policy target of increased use of wood chips, there was a linear or exponential increase in European imports of deciduous wood chips during the past 10 years from countries harbouring potentially harmful Agrilus species. MaxEnt showed high environmental suitability in Europe for the four selected Agrilus species, particularly in Eastern Europe and European Russia for A. anxius, A. bilineatus and A. planipennis and in southern Europe for A. politus. Documented susceptible host trees are widely distributed in the predicted areas of Agrilus distribution in Europe, and these areas receive large quantities of deciduous wood chips from countries where these and other Agrilus species are present. Thus, it was concluded that the fundamental conditions for introduction and establishment of Agrilus species in Europe are in place. {\textcopyright} 2015 Organisation Europ{\'{e}}enne et M{\'{e}}diterran{\'{e}}enne pour la Protection des Plantes/European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization.},

abstract = {Reliable distribution maps are crucial for the management of invasive plant species. An alternative to traditional field surveys is the use of remote sensing data, which allows coverage of large areas. However, most remote sensing studies on invasive plant species focus on mapping large stands of easily detectable study species. In this study, we used hyperspectral remote sensing data in combination with field data to derive a distribution map of an invasive bryophyte species, Campylopus introflexus, on the island of Sylt in Northern Germany. We collected plant cover data on 57 plots to calibrate the model and presence/absence data of C. introflexus on another 150 plots for independent validation. We simultaneously acquired airborne hyperspectral (APEX) images during summer 2014, providing 285 spectral bands. We used a Maxent modelling approach to map the distribution of C. introflexus. Although C. introflexus is a small and inconspicuous species, we were able to map its distribution with an overall accuracy of 75 {\%}. Reducing the sampling effort from 57 to 7 plots, our models performed fairly well until sampling effort dropped below 12 plots. The model predicts that C. introflexus is present in about one quarter of the pixels in our study area. The highest percentage of C. introflexus is predicted in the dune grassland. Our findings suggest that hyperspectral remote sensing data have the potential to provide reliable information about the degree of bryophyte invasion, and thus provide an alternative to traditional field mapping approaches over large areas. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {Landslides are important geomorphic events that sculpt river basins by eroding hillslopes and providing sediments to coastal areas. However, landslides are also hazardous events for socio-ecological systems in river basins causing enormous biodiversity, economic, and social impacts. We propose a probabilistic spatially explicit model for the prediction of landslide patterns based on a maximum entropy principle model (MAXENT). The model inputs are the centers of mass of historical landslides and environmental variables at the basin scale. The model has only three parameters requiring calibration: the threshold for the network extraction, the trade-off factor between model complexity and accuracy, and the threshold of landslide susceptibility. The calibration on a subset of observations detects the environmental drivers and their relative importance for landslides. We employ the model in the Arno basin, Italy, selected because of its widespread landslide dynamics and the large availability of landslide observations. The model reproduces the size distribution and location of over 27,500 historical landslides for the Arno basin with an accuracy of 86{\%} obtained from the variable-landslide inference on about 37{\%} of observed landslides. Future landslide patterns are predicted for 17 A1B and A2 rainfall scenarios and for a multimodel ensemble from 2000 to 2100. We show that potential landslide hazard is strongly correlated with variation in the 12 and 48 h rainfall with a return time of 10 years. As the climate gets wetter, the average probability of landslides gets higher which is shown by the landslide size distribution. Hence, the landslide size distribution is a fingerprint of the geomorphic effectiveness of rainfall as a function of climate change. MAXENT is proposed as a parsimonious model for the prediction of landslide patterns with respect to more complex models. The need for very accurately sampled and delineated landslides is lower than for other prediction models. Moreover, the model informs about the drivers of landslides and their relative importance without assumptions on the main triggering factors. This is important to inform monitoring of environmental variables. Our modeling approach can enhance the planning of socio-ecological systems in river basins by improving the accuracy of landslide prediction in space and time. {\textcopyright}2013.

abstract = {The extent and intensity of pre-Columbian impacts on lowland Amazonia have remained uncertain and controversial. Various indicators can be used to gauge the impact of pre-Columbian societies, but the formation of nutrient-enriched terra preta soils has been widely accepted as an indication of long-term settlement and site fidelity. Using known and newly discovered terra preta sites and maximum entropy algorithms (Maxent), we determined the influence of regional environmental conditions on the likelihood that terra pretas would have been formed at any given location in lowland Amazonia. Terra pretas were most frequently found in central and eastern Amazonia along the lower courses of the major Amazonian rivers. Terrain, hydrologic and soil characteristics were more important predictors of terra preta distributions than climatic conditions. Our modelling efforts indicated that terra pretas are likely to be found throughout ca 154 063 km2 or 3.2{\%} of the forest. We also predict that terra preta formation was limited in most of western Amazonia. Model results suggested that the distribution of terra pretawas highly predictable basedon environmental parameters. We provided targets for future archaeological surveys under the vast forest canopy and also highlighted how few of the long-term forest inventory sites in Amazonia are able to capture the effects of historical disturbance. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

There is little published information regarding the ecology of the whale shark in Mexico, and the role that the Mexican Caribbean plays as habitat for this species. This area has been recognized as important for the whale shark and therefore it is necessary to determine the environmental factors that shape the distribution of these animals. The aim of this study was to identify key environmental factors associated with whale shark feeding aggregations and to determine the patterns in habitat suitability for whale sharks in the Mexican Caribbean through the modeling approach of maximum entropy. Whale shark data obtained for this study included 250 records during April to September (2008–2012). The MaxEnt model performed better than random and produced an area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.946. Primary productivity and sea surface temperature were the variables most strongly related to whale shark sightings. The model predicted a high suitability in areas located to the north of Isla Contoy and the offshore area east of Isla Contoy named “Afuera” ({\textgreater}0.75), with medium suitability north of Cabo Catoche ({\textgreater}0.5) and lower suitability for the northeast of Cabo Catoche ({\textless}0.5). The habitat suitability maps also indicated seasonal variations, showing a higher prediction of whale shark sightings during the rainy season (June to October), when primary productivity is higher in the area. {\textcopyright} 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht},

abstract = {Salt pannes are an ecologically important but poorly understood feature of the salt marsh environments. Like all coastal marshes, salt pannes are threatened by sea-level rise; therefore, it is important to assess how they will be affected by rising seas. Because of a lack of understanding regarding salt panne formation and the possibly stochastic nature of their development, a traditional and purely deterministic modeling approach is unsuitable for assessing the impacts of sea-level rise on salt pannes. This research used a combination of deterministic and stochastic models to simulate the land-cover suitability for salt pannes in the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, Mississippi, under five sea-level rise scenarios, including a rise of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m by 2100. The Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) simulated general land-cover at the study site. However, SLAMM does not include capabilities for specifically simulating salt panne land-cover. As such, MaxEnt used the results from SLAMM, along with other environmental variables, to specifically simulate the spatial suitability for salt panne land-cover. The results showed that the total wetland and upland areas are predicted to consistently decrease under increasing rates of sea-level rise. However, because of elevation plateaus in the study site, the area of land-cover specifically suitable for salt pannes does not follow the same pattern. The primary environmental driver of salt panne land-cover suitability is elevation, followed by topographic depressional areas. Land cover contributes very little to the model results. This novel use of a land-cover suitability model has important potential for being applied to additional studies to investigate drivers of land-cover change, identify transitional areas, and examine land-cover fitness under competition. {\textcopyright} Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2016.},

The phylogeny of all recognized Nesillas taxa was reconstructed employing Bayesian phylogenetic methods and divergence times were estimated using a range of substitution rates and clock assumptions. Spatiotemporal patterns of population expansion were inferred and niches of different lineages were compared using ecological niche modelling. Our results indicate that taxa endemic to the Comoros are paraphyletic and that the two endemic species on Madagascar (Nesillas typica and Nesillas lantzii) are not sister taxa. The brush-warblers started to diversify approximately 1.6 Mya, commencing with the separation of the clade formed by two species endemic to the Comoros (Nesillas brevicaudata and Nesillas mariae) from the rest of the genus. The lineages leading to the two Malagasy species diverged approximately 0.9 Mya; each with significantly different modern ecological niches and the subject of separate demographic processes. Patterns of diversification and endemism in Nesillas were shaped by multiple long distance dispersal events and inter-island colonization, a recurring pattern for different lineages on western Indian Ocean islands. The diversification dynamics observed for Nesillas are also consistent with the taxon cycle hypothesis. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Linnean Society of London},

Modelling suggests the Flinders Ranges will experience species turnover while suitable climatic habitat will be retained in the Mount Lofty Ranges for the current suite of species.

The results implied that R. macrocnemis prefers grassland and needle leaf deciduous forest with high elevations, and low temperature. {\textcopyright} 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of neural networks is a major challenge in experimental neuroscience. For that purpose, a modelling of the recorded activity that reproduces the main statistics of the data is required. In the first part, we present a review on recent results dealing with spike train statistics analysis using maximum entropy models (MaxEnt). Most of these studies have focused on modelling synchronous spike patterns, leaving aside the temporal dynamics of the neural activity. However, the maximum entropy principle can be generalized to the temporal case, leading to Markovian models where memory effects and time correlations in the dynamics are properly taken into account. In the second part, we present a new method based on Monte Carlo sampling which is suited for the fitting of large-scale spatio-temporal MaxEnt models. The formalism and the tools presented here will be essential to fit MaxEnt spatio-temporal models to large neural ensembles. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl.},

It has large distribution range but different populations are fragmented within the western Himalayan moist temperate forests. Its distribution in Pakistan is restricted to some parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJ{\&}K).This species is globally ‘vulnerable' since its fragmented small populations are declining dueto continuing forest loss and habitat destruction throughout its range. This study was carried out to model the potential distribution and habitat of Western Tragopanin Neelam and Muzaffarabad districts of AJ{\&}K by incorporating the physical, biological and climatic variables into MaxEnt model. Land cover data, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), slope, aspect, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), temperature, precipitation, topographic and sighting datasets were processed in Geographic Information System (GIS) to produce meaningful predictor variables, subsequently used in the MaxEnt software. The results showed that 11,112 ha area (2{\%} of the total study area) is highly suitable for Western Tragopan, 30,248 ha area (5.3{\%}) moderately suitable while 525,445 ha (92.7{\%}) area is unsuitable. Jackknife test evaluated the importance of predictor variables and DEM, precipitation and land cover were found to be the most important variables for this study. The study evaluated the species-habitat relationship within the study area and can be helpful in the management and in-situ conservation planning of the species in its distribution range. {\textcopyright} 2015, Pakistan Agricultural Scientists Forum.All rights reserved.},

This study explored the observed and predicted distribution of an uncommon soft coral species, Dendronephthya australis within the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park. Dendronephthya australis was mapped by video operated by a SCUBA diver towing a time synchronised GPS. A species distribution model was created to explore the possible occurrence of D. australis outside of the mapped area, using four environmental parameters: bathymetry, slope of seabed, velocity of tidal currents, and distance from estuary mouth. Dendronephthya australis colonies occurred along the southern shoreline in the Port Stephens estuary between Fly Point and Corlette Point, but no colonies were found within sanctuary (no-take) zones within the marine park. The model illustrated limited habitat suitability for D. australis within a larger section of the estuary, suggesting this species has specific environmental requirements survival. Owing to its current threats (anchor damage and fishing line entanglement), implications from these findings will assist future management and protection decisions, particularly in regard to its protection within a marine park. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2016.},

Of the temperate clades, one is restricted to the Far East, the other one (Vincetoxicum s. str. Clade) extends into Europe, but their ranges overlap in Central China and Japan. Three species invasive in North America, V. hirundinaria, V. nigrum and V. rossicum, are members of the Vincetoxicum s. str. Clade. We explore the prerequisites for the range expansion in the Vincetoxicum s. str. Clade performing Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses on sequences of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the nuclear external transcribed spacer region (ETS), and five plastid markers. The resulting phylogeny is used to conduct biogeographic analysis using BioGeoBEARS to reconstruct ancestral species ranges. Moreover, we map the known occurrences of two rare characters in Asclepiadoideae, the possession of phenanthroindolizidine alkaloids and reported cases of autogamy onto our phylogeny. Finally, we have conducted ecological niche modelling using Maxent on a total of 220 spatially unique occurrences of nine Vincetoxicum s. str. species spanning more than 4000 km along the east-west gradient to learn about the climatic conditions along the presumed migration route. Our results indicate a north-westward migration in Vincetoxicum s. str. along the Asian mountain chains to Europe. Climatic preferences of the nine species sampled are dissimilar, except for the common exposure to at least one month of subfreezing temperatures, indicating a rather wide climatic tolerance for the clade as a whole. The three species invasive in North America belong to the northern Eurasian subclade and show the rare combination of phenanthroindolizidine alkaloids and autogamy. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

A niche-based modelling technique was used to predict current suitable climatic habitat for most Bradypodion species and for their phylogenetic clades. Additionally, the models were projected into the future (2080) using the IPCC climate change scenarios. All models for Bradypodion species and clades showed responses to predicted climate change, however, the degree and extent of these responses were individualistic. Most species responded with a contraction in predicated climatic suitability, but some registered an expansion or a shift.

abstract = {Aims This study explores the patterns of niche differentiation in a group of seven closely related columbines (genus Aquilegia, Ranunculaceae) from the Iberian Peninsula. Populations of these columbines are subject to complex patterns of divergent selection across environments, which partly explain the taxonomic structure of the group. This suggests the hypothesis that niche divergence must have occurred along the process of diversification of the group. Methods We used MaxEnt to build environmental niche models of seven subspecies belonging to the three species of Aquilegia present in the Iberian Peninsula. From these models, we compared the environmental niches through two different approaches: ENMtools and multivariate methods. Important Findings MaxEnt distributions conformed closely to the actual distribution of the study taxa. ENMtools methods failed to uncover any clear patterns of niche differentiation or conservatism in Iberian columbines. Multivariate analyses indicate the existence of differentiation along altitudinal gradients and along a gradient of climatic conditions determined by the summer precipitation and temperatures. However, climatic conditions related to winter temperature and precipitation, as well as soil properties, were equally likely to show conservatism or divergence. The complex patterns of niche evolution we found suggest that Iberian Columbines have not been significantly constrained by forces of niche conservatism, so they could respond adaptively to the fast and profound climate changes in the Iberian Peninsula through the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Author.

abstract = {Various studies have shown that model performance may vary depending on the species being modelled, the study area, or the number of sampled localities, and suggest that it is necessary to assess which model is better for a particular situation. Thus, in this study we evaluate the performance of different techniques for modelling the distribution of Patagonian insects. We applied eight of the most widely used modelling methods (artificial neural networks, BIOCLIM, classification and regression trees, DOMAIN, generalized additive models, GARP, generalized linear models, and Maxent) to the distribution of ten Patagonian insect species. We compared model performance with five accuracy measures. To overcome the problem of not having reliable absence data with which to evaluate model performance, we used randomly selected pseudo-absences located outside of the polygon area defined by taxonomic experts. Our analyses show significant differences among modelling methods depending on the chosen accuracy measure. Maxent performed the best according to four out of the five accuracy measures, although its accuracy did not differ significantly from that obtained with artificial neural networks. When assessed on per species basis, Maxent was also one of the strongest performing methods, particularly for species sampled from a relatively low number of localities. Overall, our study identified four groups of modelling techniques based on model performance. The top-performing group is composed of Maxent and artificial neural networks, followed closely by the DOMAIN technique. The third group includes GARP, GAM, GLM, and CART, and the fourth best performer is the BIOCLIM technique. Although these results may allow obtaining better distributional predictions for reserve selection, it is necessary to be cautious in their use due to the provisional nature of these simulations.},

abstract = {Abstract: Spawning habitat degradation has been linked to declines in naturally reproducing Muskellunge Esox masquinongy populations, and managers require efficient methods to identify and protect these habitats. We collected spawning habitat data from 28 lakes in northern Wisconsin to determine Muskellunge spawning habitat selection and to create a GIS-based model for predicting the locations of spawning sites. Spawning site selection by Muskellunge may be more complex than previously thought. Muskellunge showed selection for spawning in habitats with a sheltered effective fetch and east-facing shorelines. The strongest selection was for habitats with a combination of moderate slope, small flats, and concave bathymetric curvature. Muskellunge selected against steeply sloping shorelines; very large areas of shallow flats; developed shorelines; herbaceous wetlands; and complex-leafed submersed aquatic vegetation. Lake trophic status appears to interact with other habit variables to determine spawning site selection; sites without submersed aquatic vegetation were more strongly selected in eutrophic lakes than in other lake types. A GIS model of spawning site selection was created using the machine learning program MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy Modeling). The model predicted that Muskellunge would spawn in areas with moderately sheltered effective fetches, moderate to small areas of shallow flats, away from outflowing streams, and (to a lesser extent) along shorelines facing east or west. The model was tested on novel lakes using area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis, in which values ranged from 0.5 (predictions no better than random) to 1.0 (perfect assignment). The mean AUCtest value (i.e., the expectation of model performance for a novel lake) was 0.637 (SD = 0.12). When the model was used to designate the best 20{\%} of available spawning habitat area for Muskellunge in each lake (based on the relative probability of spawning), that area contained 32{\%} of the spawning sites. The model provides an efficient method for management agencies and conservation groups to use in designating spawning habitat for conservation and in communicating with the public through spawning habitat maps. {\textcopyright} 2015, {\textcopyright} American Fisheries Society 2015.},

In this issue of Journal of Applied Ecology, we (Murray 2011) employ a correlative species distribution model for infection with the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), cause of amphibian chytridiomycosis, to derive useful information for the immediate management and research of this pathogen in Australia. Also in this issue, Rohr, Halstead {\&} Raffel (2011) comment on some of the potential limitations of our approach and the value of our results in practice. 3. Synthesis and applications. Here we show that while a focus on mechanisms of dispersal and transmission among hosts, as advocated in both studies, is an important objective for modelling Bd distribution under climate change or at invasion fronts, correlative models can be of immediate value for their ability to generate a baseline hypothesis about the current potential distribution of this lethal pathogen and for efficiently identifying gaps in current knowledge. As demonstrated in our paper, this should help improve the immediate allocation of limited research and management resources for future surveillance efforts and proactive species conservation. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {1.A major limitation to effective management of narrow-range crayfish populations is the paucity of information on the spatial distribution of crayfish species and a general understanding of the interacting environmental variables that drive current and future potential distributional patterns. 2.Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modeling Software (MaxEnt) was used to predict the current and future potential distributions of four endemic crayfish species in the Ouachita Mountains. Current distributions were modelled using climate, geology, soils, land use, landform and flow variables thought to be important to lotic crayfish. Potential changes in the distribution were forecast by using models trained on current conditions and projecting onto the landscape predicted under climate-change scenarios. 3.The modelled distribution of the four species closely resembled the perceived distribution of each species but also predicted populations in streams and catchments where they had not previously been collected. Soils, elevation and winter precipitation and temperature most strongly related to current distributions and represented 65-87{\%} of the predictive power of the models. Model accuracy was high for all models, and model predictions of new populations were verified through additional field sampling. 4.Current models created using two spatial resolutions (1 and 4.5km2) showed that fine-resolution data more accurately represented current distributions. For three of the four species, the 1-km2 resolution models resulted in more conservative predictions. However, the modelled distributional extent of Orconectes leptogonopodus was similar regardless of data resolution. Field validations indicated 1-km2 resolution models were more accurate than 4.5-km2 resolution models. 5.Future projected (4.5-km2 resolution models) model distributions indicated three of the four endemic species would have truncated ranges with low occurrence probabilities under the low-emission scenario, whereas two of four species would be severely restricted in range under moderate-high emissions. Discrepancies in the two emission scenarios probably relate to the exclusion of behavioural adaptations from species-distribution models. 6.These model predictions illustrate possible impacts of climate change on narrow-range endemic crayfish populations. The predictions do not account for biotic interactions, migration, local habitat conditions or species adaptation. However, we identified the constraining landscape features acting on these populations that provide a framework for addressing habitat needs at a fine scale and developing targeted and systematic monitoring programmes.

Environmental variables and occurrence data from a preliminary survey were used in the MaxEnt modeling, a statistical model to know the potential distribution area of the enigmatic species in Arunachal Pradesh. Later, a population survey was carried out in Tawang and West Kameng districts of the state following existing trails and paths. The distribution model revealed that only 2.4{\%} of the total landmass of the state is potential distribution habitat range for M. munzala, whereas 10.19{\%} of the total area of the two districts were shown to be potential habitat of the species. A total number of 971 individuals (including two solitary males) comprising 41 troops of M. munzala were recorded during the population survey. The mean troop size was 23.63 ± 1.21 individuals per troop ranging from 12 to 44 individuals. On average, M. munzala troops were comprised of juveniles (30.37{\%}), adult females (23.83{\%}), infants (18.22{\%}), adult males (11.53{\%}), sub-adult females (9.81{\%}), and sub-adult males (6.23{\%}). Our observed population size of M. munzala is higher in Tawang and West Kameng districts when compared with the earlier available records.

One of only seven cats to be listed as Endangered by The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the bay cat is seldom seen, rarely photographed and is widely held to be one of the least known of the world's wild cats. Consequently its distribution is known only poorly, hindering efforts for its conservation. Here we use MaxEnt niche distribution modelling to make predictions regarding its current distribution on Borneo. We collected a total of 71 occurrence records for the bay cat, stemming from all Bornean regions apart from Brunei and South Kalimantan, of which 40 were used in our modelling. Our habitat suitability modelling predicts that an extensive, contiguous area of interior Borneo, much of it hill forest, but also containing lowland and submontane forest, is suitable for the bay cat, supporting an earlier hypothesis that this cat is widespread across the island. Extreme lowlands, supporting mangrove and swamp forest habitats, were typically predicted as low suitability, as were the considerable areas of Borneo now converted to oil palm plantations. Based on the current predicted distribution we provide a list of priority areas for the conservation of the bay cat across Borneo. {\textcopyright} 2016 National University of Singapore.},

The goal of this study was to predict best ecological niches of three main malaria vectors of Iran: Anopheles stephensi, Anopheles culicifacies s.l. and Anopheles fluviatilis s.l. A databank was created which included all published data about Anopheles species of Iran from 1961 to 2015. The suitable environmental niches for the three above mentioned Anopheles species were predicted using maximum entropy model (MaxEnt). AUC (area under Roc curve) values were 0.943, 0.974 and 0.956 for An. stephensi, An. culicifacies s.l. and An. fluviatilis s.l respectively, which are considered as high potential power of model in the prediction of species niches. The biggest bioclimatic contributor for An. stephensi and An. fluviatilis s.l. was bio 15 (precipitation seasonality), 25.5{\%} and 36.1{\%} respectively, followed by bio 1 (annual mean temperature), 20.8{\%} for An. stephensi and bio 4 (temperature seasonality) with 49.4{\%} contribution for An. culicifacies s.l. This is the first step in the mapping of the country's malaria vectors. Hence, future weather situation can change the dispersal maps of Anopheles. Iran is under elimination phase of malaria, so that such spatio-temporal studies are essential and could provide guideline for decision makers for IVM strategies in problematic areas. {\textcopyright} 2017},

abstract = {As native ecosystems are degraded throughout the world, the importance of managing, conserving, and restoring wildlife habitat escalates. We must carefully consider which approach to habitat conservation is optimal, given that resources for habitat conservation are limited. One enticing option involves channeling limited resources to manage for a single umbrella species, assuming that a number of other species within the same ecosystem would also benefit. The danger inherent to this approach is that care must be taken when selecting an umbrella species that maximizes ecosystem-wide benefits. This paper presents a combination of methods to quantitatively evaluate if keystone species, given their integral role in affecting the ecosystem where they reside, can also function as effective umbrellas for habitat management. In a case study, we evaluate two imperiled keystone species, the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) and the red-cockaded woodpecker (Leucontopicus borealis), within a global biodiversity hotspot, the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem of North American coastal plain. We 1) develop spatial habitat models in MaxEnt for 10 terrestrial vertebrate wildlife species of conservation interest across an 11 million hectare region, 2) identify the preferred umbrella candidate with spatially-explicit correlation and range overlap analyses using ENMTools, and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen umbrella species with a test of niche similarity and quantitative habitat suitability comparisons in ArcGIS. Our results suggest the potential for an endemic keystone species to effectively function as an umbrella species. Specifically, we identified the gopher tortoise as the preferred umbrella, given the overlap in suitable habitat for 9 of 10 species evaluated in this ecosystem. These results are significant for habitat management within this region, but most importantly, this application of spatially-explicit modeling to quantitatively measure habitat suitability is an advance in approaches to habitat conservation planning. We encourage others to use these accessible methods and consider evaluating keystone species as umbrellas to optimize their approach for managing, conserving, and restoring ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract = {We determined breeding season habitat preferences for a declining migrant grassland bird, the Whinchat Saxicola rubetra, using intensive, territory-scale habitat and invertebrate data, and independently gathered landscape-scale field survey and remotely sensed habitat data to determine whether the same habitat relationships were evident at both spatial scales. At the territory scale, low-elevation and a heterogeneous vegetation structure with a high density of perches and tussocks were the dominant features of occupied habitats. The landscape-scale model successfully predicted areas where breeding Whinchats were more likely to occur, and similar and consistent relationships with habitat features occurred at both spatial scales. However, plant species richness and topographic slope elicited different responses at different spatial scales, with steeper slopes and high plant species richness favoured at the landscape scale, whereas at the territory scale, low plant species richness was preferred and slope did not determine settlement. These differences reflect differences in the way the data were measured and extrapolated. This study identifies important attributes of lowland grassland habitats and landscapes for a stable population of breeding Whinchats, and the analysis shows the good predictive ability of remotely sensed data to model this species' distribution at larger spatial extents. Our findings provide methods for assessing habitat availability for this declining species and for managing habitats and landscapes to provide these essential elements. {\textcopyright} 2016 British Ornithologists' Union},

Results from MAXENT modelling showed that the May-October accumulated precipitation, altitude and November-April photoperiod are the most contributing variables 85.8{\%} at explaining geographical distribution of S. hispanica. Future climate change will not cause a May-October accumulated precipitation variation larger than ±10{\%} in areas with ch{\'{i}}a populations; however, mean annual temperature will increase between 1 and 3°C. The ecological descriptors of S. hispanica showed ample precipitation, temperature and altitude adaptation ranges. According to niche modelling it can be inferred that climate change in the studied periods will provoke an increment in surface with high and mid environmental aptitude for S. hispanica. Thus, it is probable that climate change will have a positive effect on future distribution and dispersion of this species.},

abstract = {Little information exists with regard to suitable summer habitat of Myotis sodalis (Indiana Bat) in West Virginia. Our research objectives were to use ultrasonic acoustic equipment and automated identification software to collect presence data for Indiana Bats and to examine habitat characteristics and availability across the local landscape. We used a maximum entropy (MAXENT) approach to determine if the distribution of various ecological factors such as landuse/landcover, forest fragmentation, aspect, area solar radiation, slope, proximity to permanent water, and elevation influenced foraging-habitat suitability of Indiana Bats. We sampled across the 1160-ha Camp Dawson Collective Training Area in Preston County, WV, to determine Indiana Bat presence. We employed the collected presence data to examine habitat suitability within a 16,151-ha study area encompassing the training facility. Based on MAXENT results, we characterized highly suitable Indiana Bat habitat as including large tracts of contiguous forest cover ({\textgreater}200 ha) associated with low to modest slopes ({\textless}20°), road corridors, and areas of high solar radiation (≥5.5 × 105 WH/m2). High (81-100{\%}) and medium-high (61-80{\%}) suitability classes were uncommon across the landscape (0.6{\%} and 2.7{\%}, respectively), with the broad medium-to-high suitability classes (41-100{\%}) collectively comprising only 11.4{\%} of the study area. Elevation (m) and aspect contributed little to the model and displayed low permutation importance that did not vary notably from the corresponding percent contribution. These variables, along with close proximity to permanent water (≤200 m away), are likely not limiting ecological factors. The results of this study supplement current knowledge of summer habitat of the Indiana Bat and provide land and wildlife managers localized guidance on conservation priorities within the region.},

abstract = {Aim: We introduce and evaluate the potential effect of spatially marginal localities (specifically those protruding into unsuitable regions), in overestimating species niches and distributions when using ecological niche models (ENMs). Location: North-western South America. Methods: We built an ENM for the Caribbean spiny pocket mouse (Heteromys anomalus) using MaxEnt and climatic variables. This species typically inhabits extensive tropical forests but can also range into drier habitats through patches of mesic vegetation. We ranked occurrence records according to the suitability value they received, and retrieved habitat information from collectors' field notes and the literature to determine whether those receiving lower values correspond to spatially marginal localities protruding into unsuitable regions. We then built a model excluding a subset of such localities and compared its geographic and environmental prediction with that of the original model. Results: Models differed substantially in their estimates of suitability. The original model resulted in an overly extensive prediction, considering as suitable hot and dry regions dominated by xerophytic vegetation. Records receiving the lowest suitability values in this model corresponded mainly to captures in patches of mesic forest surrounded by thorn scrub or savannas. The model calibrated without such records restricted suitability mostly to regions characterized by the typical habitat of the species. Main conclusions: When it is not possible to use variables that are more proximal or have finer resolutions, we recommend building complementary models that, together, can provide a more realistic estimate of the species' niche and corresponding geographic distribution. Jointly interpreting these models, researchers may better differentiate between areas harbouring typical habitat and those where the species can be found only if locally favourable conditions exist. Such a distinction is of relevance for a wide range of applications relying on inferences obtained from ENMs. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim: Models of species niches and distributions have become invaluable to biogeographers over the past decade, yet several outstanding methodological issues remain. Here we address three critical ones: selecting appropriate evaluation data, detecting overfitting, and tuning program settings to approximate optimal model complexity. We integrate solutions to these issues for Maxent models, using the Caribbean spiny pocket mouse, Heteromys anomalus, as an example. Location: North-western South America. Methods: We partitioned data into calibration and evaluation datasets via three variations of k-fold cross-validation: randomly partitioned, geographically structured and masked geographically structured (which restricts background data to regions corresponding to calibration localities). Then, we carried out tuning experiments by varying the level of regularization, which controls model complexity. Finally, we gauged performance by quantifying discriminatory ability and overfitting, as well as via visual inspections of maps of the predictions in geography. Results: Performance varied among data-partitioning approaches and among regularization multipliers. The randomly partitioned approach inflated estimates of model performance and the geographically structured approach showed high overfitting. In contrast, the masked geographically structured approach allowed selection of high-performing models based on all criteria. Discriminatory ability showed a slight peak in performance around the default regularization multiplier. However, regularization levels two to four times higher than the default yielded substantially lower overfitting. Visual inspection of maps of model predictions coincided with the quantitative evaluations. Main conclusions: Species-specific tuning of model parameters can improve the performance of Maxent models. Further, accurate estimates of model performance and overfitting depend on using independent evaluation data. These strategies for model evaluation may be useful for other modelling methods as well. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the environmental correlates of species' distributions is essential for understanding population dynamics, responses to environmental changes, biodiversity patterns, and the impacts of conservation plans. Here we examine how environment controls the distribution of the neotropical genus Montrichardia at regional and local spatial scales using species distribution models (SDMs) and logistic regression, respectively. Montrichardia is a genus of aquatic macrophytes with two species, Montrichardia linifera and Montrichardia arborescens, and is often an important component of flooded habitats. We find that for each species, altitude, precipitation and temperature of the driest month figure in the best performing SDMs as the most important factors controlling large-scale distributions, suggesting that the range limits of both species are climatically constrained by plant water-energy balance and cold intolerance. At small spatial scales, logistic regression models indicate the species partition types of aquatic habitat along local gradients of water pH, conductivity, and water transparency. In summary, a hierarchy of factors may control Montrichardia distribution from large to small spatial scales. While at large spatial scales, evolutionarily conserved climatic niches may control the range limits of the genus, at small spatial scales niche differentiation allows individual species to grow in environmentally distinct aquatic habitats. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

Of these, 125 localities had information on the month when Medfly was recorded and these data were complemented by additional material found in comprehensive databases available online. Records from 1980 until present were used for medfly environmental niche modeling. Maximum Entropy Algorithm (MaxEnt) and a set of seasonally varying environmental covariates were used to predict the fundamental niche of the Medfly on a global scale. Three seasonal maps were also produced: January-April, May-August and September-December. Models performed significantly better than random achieving high accuracy scores, indicating a good discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the presence of the species. {\textcopyright} 2014 Szyniszewska, Tatem.},

abstract = {Habitat availability and environmental preferences of species are among the most important factors in determining the success of dispersal processes and therefore in shaping the distribution of protists. We explored the differences in fundamental niches and potential distributions of an ecological guild of slime mouldsprotosteloid amoebaein the Iberian Peninsula. A large set of samples collected in a north-east to south-west transect of approximately 1000 km along the peninsula was used to test the hypothesis that, together with the existence of suitable microhabitats, climate conditions may determine the probability of survival of species. Although protosteloid amoebae share similar morphologies and life history strategies, canonical correspondence analyses showed that they have varied ecological optima, and that climate conditions have an important effect in niche differentiation. Maxent environmental niche models provided consistent predictions of the probability of presence of the species based on climate data, and they were used to generate maps of potential distribution in an everything is everywhere scenario. The most important climatic factors were, in both analyses, variables that measure changes in conditions throughout the year, confirming that the alternation of fruiting bodies, cysts and amoeboid stages in the life cycles of protosteloid amoebae constitutes an advantage for surviving in a changing environment. Microhabitat affinity seems to be influenced by climatic conditions, which suggests that the micro-environment may vary at a local scale and change together with the external climate at a larger scale. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

L. pertusa reef is vulnerable to anthropogenic impact. Mapping L. pertusa distribution is fundamental for resource management, but challenging given the typical remoteness of their habitat. In this study, we used MaxEnt to predict the potential distribution of L. pertusa at the Rost Reef on Norwegian margin, based on terrain variables at multiple scales (30, 90 and 170 m). MaxEnt performed well in each of the ten runs, and successfully predicted the potential distribution of L. pertusa at Rost Reef. The suitable habitat of L. pertusa was predicted to occur predominantly on the SW-NE running ridges. Jackknife tests indicated that the terrain variables mean curvature and plan curvature at scale 170 m were the most useful parameters in prediction when used in isolation. The ridge structures at Rost Reef are likely to play an important role in influencing the coral distribution by enhancing the bottom current, therefore beneficial for feeding of the species. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {The muriqui (Brachyteles spp.), endemic to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, is the largest primate in South America and is endangered, mainly due to habitat loss. Its distribution limits are still uncertain and need to be resolved in order to determine their true conservation status. Species distribution modeling (SDM) has been used to estimate potential species distributions, even when information is incomplete. Here, we developed an environmental suitability model for the two endangered species of muriqui (Brachyteles hypoxanthus and B. arachnoides) using Maxent software. Due to historical absence of muriquis, areas with predicted high habitat suitability yet historically never occupied, were excluded from the predicted historical distribution. Combining that information with the model, it is evident that rivers are potential dispersal barriers for the muriquis. Moreover, although the two species are environmentally separated in a large part of its distribution, there is a potential contact zone where the species apparently do not overlap. This separation might be due to either a physical (i.e., Serra da Mantiqueira mountains) or a biotic barrier (the species exclude one another). Therefore, in addition to environmental characteristics, physical and biotic barriers potentially shaped the limits of the muriqui historical range. Based on these considerations, we proposed the adjustment of their historical distributional limits. Currently only 7.6{\%} of the predicted historical distribution of B. hypoxanthus and 12.9{\%} of B. arachnoides remains forested and able to sustain viable muriqui populations. In addition to measurement of habitat loss we also identified areas for conservation concern where new muriqui populations might be found. {\textcopyright} 2016 Ingberman et al.

This problem is similar to traditional text categorization, thus many related classification techniques can be adapted here. However, there is one significant difference that more language or semantic information is required for better estimating the subjectivity of a document. Therefore, in this paper, our focuses are mainly on two aspects. One is how to extract useful and meaningful language features, and the other is how to construct appropriate language models efficiently for this special task. For the first issue, we conduct a Global-Filtering and Local-Weighting strategy to select and evaluate language features in a series of n-grams with different orders and within various distance-windows. For the second issue, we adopt Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modeling methods to construct our language model framework. Besides the classical MaxEnt models, we have also constructed two kinds of improved models with Gaussian and exponential priors respectively. Detailed experiments given in this paper show that with well selected and weighted language features, MaxEnt models with exponential priors are significantly more suitable for the text subjectivity analysis task. {\textcopyright} 2008 Science Press, Beijing, China and Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, USA.},

In recent years, the natural habitat of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi has been degenerating and disappearing in China owing to excessive market demand of medicinal plant resource. This paper reports a new approach to predict potential suitable cultivation regions and to explore the key environmental factors affecting the content of active ingredients in S. baicalensis using integrated Maxent (maximum entropy) modeling and fuzzy logics. The modeling procedure used 275 occurrence records and baicalin contents of S. baicalensis collected through 2000–2014, and 16 Worldclim environmental factors as well as HWSD soil data. The result showed that six environmental factors (alt, prec7, prec1, bio4, bio1 and t{\_}ph) were determined as key influential factors that mostly affect both the habitat distribution and baicalin content of S. baicalensis. The highly suitable cultivation regions of S. baicalensis mainly distribute (with probability ≥0.50) in the northeast, the north-central and the northwest of China (total 419,857 km2). The statistically significant AUC (area under the curve) value (0.952) of ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve indicated that integrated Maxent modeling and fuzzy logics could be used to predict the potential suitable cultivation regions of medicinal plants. These results could pave the road for the habitat conservation and resource utilization of endangered medicinal plants. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this context, the development of effective methods for the classification of forest types constitutes a crucial issue as forests represent the most widespread vegetation structure and play a key role in ecosystem functioning. In this study a maximum entropy approach (Maxent) to forest type classification in a complex Mediterranean area, has been investigated. Maxent, a niche-based model of species/habitat distribution, allowed researchers to estimate the potential distribution of four forest types: Holm oak, Mixed oak, Mixed broadleaved and Riparian forests. The Maxent model's internal tests have proved a powerful tool for estimating the model's accuracy and analyzing the effects of the most important variables in the produced models. Moreover the comparison with a spectral response-based fuzzy classification, showed a higher accuracy in the Maxent outputs, demonstrating how the use of environmental variables, combined with spectral information in the classification of natural or semi-natural land cover classes, improves map accuracies. The modeling approach followed by this study, taking into account the uncertainty proper of the natural ecosystems and the use of environmental variables in land cover classification, can represent a useful approach to making more efficient and effective field inventories and to developing effective conservation policies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

All three species are members of the Asclepiad plant family, yet they differ in ecological requirements, biogeographic importance, and conservation value. Occurrence data were collected from herbarium specimens held in major herbaria of Pakistan and two years (2010 and 2011) of field surveys. The Maxent model performed better than random for the three species with an average test AUC value of 0.74 for P. spiralis, 0.84 for V. arnottianum, and 0.59 for T. hirsuta. Under the future climate change scenario, the Maxent model predicted habitat gains for P. spiralis in southern Punjab and Balochistan, and loss of habitat in south-eastern Sindh. Vincetoxicum arnottianum as well as T. hirsuta would gain habitat in upper Peaks of northern parts of Pakistan. T. hirsuta is predicted to lose most of the habitats in northern Punjab and in parches from lower peaks of Galliat, Zhob, Qalat etc. The predictive modeling approach presented here may be applied to other rare Asclepiad species, especially those under constant extinction threat. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Conservation increasingly operates at the landscape scale. For this to be effective, we need landscape scale information on species distributions and the environmental factors that underpin them. Species records are becoming increasingly available via data centres and online portals, but they are often patchy and biased. We demonstrate how such data can yield useful habitat suitability models, using bat roost records as an example. We analysed the effects of environmental variables at eight spatial scales (500 m - 6 km) on roost selection by eight bat species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, Nyctalus noctula, Myotis mystacinus, M. brandtii, M. nattereri, M. daubentonii, and Plecotus auritus) using the presence-only modelling software MaxEnt. Modelling was carried out on a selection of 418 data centre roost records from the Lake District National Park, UK. Target group pseudoabsences were selected to reduce the impact of sampling bias. Multi-scale models, combining variables measured at their best performing spatial scales, were used to predict roosting habitat suitability, yielding models with useful predictive abilities. Small areas of deciduous woodland consistently increased roosting habitat suitability, but other habitat associations varied between species and scales. Pipistrellus were positively related to built environments at small scales, and depended on large-scale woodland availability. The other, more specialist, species were highly sensitive to human-altered landscapes, avoiding even small rural towns. The strength of many relationships at large scales suggests that bats are sensitive to habitat modifications far from the roost itself. The fine resolution, large extent maps will aid targeted decision-making by conservationists and planners. We have made available an ArcGIS toolbox that automates the production of multi-scale variables, to facilitate the application of our methods to other taxa and locations. Habitat suitability modelling has the potential to become a standard tool for supporting landscape-scale decision-making as relevant data and open source, user-friendly, and peer-reviewed software become widely available. {\textcopyright} 2015 Bellamy, Altringham.

Our assessment revealed that Maxent was the most capable of the four modeling methods in producing useful results with sample sizes as small as 5, 10 and 25 occurrences. The other methods compensated reasonably well (Domain and GARP) to poorly (Bioclim) when presented with datasets of small sample sizes. We show that multiple evaluation measures are necessary to determine accuracy of models produced with presence-only data. Further, we found that accuracy of models is greater for species with small geographic ranges and limited environmental tolerance, ecological characteristics of many rare species.

abstract = {Riparian erosion is one of the major causes of sediment and contaminant load to streams, degradation of riparian wildlife habitats, and land loss hazards. Because of the complex interactions between the mechanisms that govern soil detachment, assessing erosion vulnerability at the watershed scale is challenging. The main objective of this study was to develop a methodology to identify areas along the riparian zone that are susceptible to erosion. The framework was developed by integrating a physically-based watershed model MIKE-SHE, to simulate the hydrologic variables, and a habitat suitability model, MaxEnt, to quantify the probability of presence of erosion. The changes in elevation (i.e., erosion) were localized based on two LIDARs (2009 and 2012) and used as sample locations in MaxEnt. The environmental features used as constraints in the estimation were land cover, soil, slope, and the hydrologic variables. The modeling framework was evaluated in the Fort Cobb watershed, Oklahoma. Results showed that the most vulnerable areas for very high erosion (1.38 m to 4.27 m) were located at the upper riparian zones of the Cobb and Lake Sub-watersheds. Approximative ly 80{\%} of the riparian zone has a 30{\%} or less probability to experience "very high" erosion while the remaining 20{\%} has a probability of up to 70{\%}. Furthermore, the results revealed that soil type and slope were the most important predictor of riparian erosion across the watershed. Soils found to be the most prone to "very high" erosion belong to hydrologic group B and C with high sand or silt composition. By being able to identify the most vulnerable areas for stream and riparian sediment mobilization, conservation and managerial practices can be focused on areas needing the most attention and resources.},

Maximum-entropy modelling (Maxent) was used with presence-only data to forecast environmental suitability for the two crayfish species based on five climate variables, slope, land cover, and a human impact index. SDMs showed good to excellent performance and were able to capture the range of both Austropotamobius species. Presence probabilities were mostly determined by climate variables, and climate niches partly overlap, with white-clawed crayfish occurring at conditions with less extreme winter temperatures and lower temperature seasonality than stone crayfish. Human impact contributed between 10 and 27{\%} to the models and was negatively related to presence probabilities. Contribution of land cover was low (5{\%}) but showed a positive relationship with deciduous broadleaf forest in both species. Both SDMs indicated several catchments with high predicted environmental suitability but no present occurrence records. Subsequent crayfish and habitat surveys in these catchments revealed four streams considered suitable for reintroduction and led to discovery of five previously unknown white-clawed crayfish populations. Overall, SDMs proved to be a powerful tool for conservation planning of freshwater crayfish species. {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) is a widely used algorithm for predicting species distributions across space and time. Properly assessing the uncertainty in such predictions is non-trivial and requires validation with independent datasets. Notably, model complexity (number of model parameters) remains a major concern in relation to overfitting and, hence, transferability of Maxent models. An emerging approach is to validate the cross-temporal transferability of model predictions using paleoecological data. In this study, we assess the effect of model complexity on the performance of Maxent projections across time using two European plant species (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. and Corylus avellana L.) with an extensive late Quaternary fossil record in Spain as a study case. We fit 110 models with different levels of complexity under present time and tested model performance using AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and AICc (corrected Akaike Information Criterion) through the standard procedure of randomly partitioning current occurrence data. We then compared these results to an independent validation by projecting the models to mid-Holocene (6000 years before present) climatic conditions in Spain to assess their ability to predict fossil pollen presence-absence and abundance. We find that calibrating Maxent models with default settings result in the generation of overly complex models. While model performance increased with model complexity when predicting current distributions, it was higher with intermediate complexity when predicting mid-Holocene distributions. Hence, models of intermediate complexity resulted in the best trade-off to predict species distributions across time. Reliable temporal model transferability is especially relevant for forecasting species distributions under future climate change. Consequently, species-specific model tuning should be used to find the best modeling settings to control for complexity, notably with paleoecological data to independently validate model projections. For cross-temporal projections of species distributions for which paleoecological data is not available, models of intermediate complexity should be selected. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Guinier analysis of the SAXS profiles yielded a radius of gyration, R(g), of 19.7 ± 0.3 {\AA} for the native protein and 16.9 ± 0.3 {\AA} for the drug/protein complex. Maximum entropy (maxent) methods of data analysis were used to calculate the distance distribution function, p(r). From this analysis, the R(g) for the native protein is 20.9 ± 0.1 {\AA} and that for the complex 16.7 ± 0.1 {\AA}. The measured SAXS profiles and the derived p(r) for calmodulin agree with profiles calculated from the crystallographic structure of calmodulin. Major structural changes are induced in calmodulin on binding cyclosporin-A. A model consistent with the observed scattering profiles is an ellipsoid with major axes 55 and 36 {\AA}. Molecular modeling of the calmodulin molecule suggests that bond rotation in the flexible $\alpha$-helix linker region produces models consistent with the above observations.},

abstract = {The reference condition of a river ecosystem is often used as a benchmark against which restoration activities are framed. However, the reference condition approach is not suitable for all river health assessments given undisturbed reference sites similar to a test site may not exist. We tested the ability of applying individual Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to predict the "natural" fish assemblages in a regulated coastal Australian river. Environmental data and fish collections from training sites were used to generate predictive models for 21 species. Model accuracy was high with the area under the receiver operating curve greater than 0.80 for the majority of species. The SDMs were then used to determine the natural fish assemblages and the condition of the sites in the test river was then assessed as the observed to expected species ratio (O/E). We expected that the O/E ratio would decline upstream through a series of weirs that created barriers to fish passage. Results confirmed that an inverse relationship existed between the number of weirs present on the test river and the O/E ratio, largely due to the decline in diadromous species. Our study clearly demonstrates the usefulness of the SDM approach to riverine health assessment in situations where undisturbed reference sites do not exist. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.), an invasive winter annual grass, may be increasing in extent and abundance at high elevations in the western United States. This would pose a great threat to high-elevation plant communities and resources. However, data to track this species in high-elevation environments are limited. To address changes in the distribution and abundance of downy brome and the factors most associated with its occurrence, we used field sampling and statistical methods, and niche modeling. In 2007, we resampled plots from two vegetation surveys in Rocky Mountain National Park for presence and cover of downy brome. One survey was established in 1993 and had been resampled in 1999. The other survey was established in 1996 and had not been resampled until our study. Although not all comparisons between years demonstrated significant changes in downy brome abundance, its mean cover increased nearly fivefold from 1993 (0.7{\%}) to 2007 (3.6{\%}) in one of the two vegetation surveys (P = 0.06). Although the average cover of downy brome within the second survey appeared to be increasing from 1996 to 2007, this slight change from 0.5{\%} to 1.2{\%} was not statistically significant (P = 0.24). Downy brome was present in 50{\%} more plots in 1999 than in 1993 (P = 0.02) in the first survey. In the second survey, downy brome was present in 30{\%} more plots in 2007 than in 1996 (P = 0.08). Maxent, a species-environmental matching model, was generally able to predict occurrences of downy brome, as new locations were in the ranges predicted by earlier generated models. The model found that distance to roads, elevation, and vegetation community influenced the predictions most. The strong response of downy brome to interannual environmental variability makes detecting change challenging, especially with small sample sizes. However, our results suggest that the area in which downy brome occurs is likely increasing in Rocky Mountain National Park through increased frequency and cover. Field surveys along with predictive modeling will be vital in directing efforts to manage this highly invasive species. {\textcopyright} Weed Science Society of America 2011.},

This study identifies biogeographic patterns in North-African canids through the combination of high resolution presence data with 16 environmental factors. Predictive models trained in north-west Africa are projected to all North Africa. canids exhibited distinct biogeographical affinities. GIS tools and Maximum Entropy models identify a mixture of climatic and habitat factors as main predictors of species occurrence. Suitable habitats for North-African canids are mostly fragmented: probable occurrence was identified for Canis aureus in Saharan peripheral regions and mountains, for Vulpes pallida in a narrow band along the Sahel and in southern Saharan mountains, for Vulpes rueppellii throughout the Sahara, for Vulpes vulpes in northern Africa until the Sahara northern limit, and for Vulpes zerda in almost all Sahara. Areas of potential sympatry between species with similar niches and parapatric ranges are identified along relatively narrow bands. The small pixel size of projections allows the identification of suitable refuges for species otherwise absent in the driest Saharan habitats, providing framework data for the definition of the global conservation status of V. pallida, and conservation strategies for the guild. The biological value of Saharan mountains is emphasised as they constitute isolated suitable areas. Ecological-niche based models should be developed for other endangered Saharan vertebrates. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {• Background and Aims: A worldwide increase in tree decline and mortality has been linked to climate change and, where these represent foundation species, this can have important implications for ecosystem functions. This study tests a combined approach of phylogeographic analysis and species distribution modelling to provide a climate change context for an observed decline in crown health and an increase in mortality in Eucalyptus wandoo, an endemic tree of south-western Australia. • Methods: Phylogeographic analyses were undertaken using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of chloroplast DNA in 26 populations across the species distribution. Parsimony analysis of haplotype relationships was conducted, a haplotype network was prepared, and haplotype and nucleotide diversity were calculated. Species distribution modelling was undertaken using Maxent models based on extant species occurrences and projected to climate models of the last glacial maximum (LGM). • Key Results: A structured pattern of diversity was identified, with the presence of two groups that followed a climatic gradient from mesic to semi-arid regions. Most populations were represented by a single haplotype, but many haplotypes were shared among populations, with some having widespread distributions. A putative refugial area with high haplotype diversity was identified at the centre of the species distribution. Species distribution modelling showed high climatic suitability at the LGM and high climatic stability in the central region where higher genetic diversity was found, and low suitability elsewhere, consistent with a pattern of range contraction. • Conclusions: Combination of phylogeography and paleo-distribution modelling can provide an evolutionary context for climate-driven tree decline, as both can be used to cross-validate evidence for refugia and contraction under harsh climatic conditions. This approach identified a central refugial area in the test species E. wandoo, with more recent expansion into peripheral areas from where it had contracted at the LGM. This signature of contraction from lower rainfall areas is consistent with current observations of decline on the semi-arid margin of the range, and indicates low capacity to tolerate forecast climatic change. Identification of a paleo-historical context for current tree decline enables conservation interventions to focus on maintaining genetic diversity, which provides the evolutionary potential for adaptation to climate change. {\textcopyright} The Author 2015.

abstract = {During the last decades the disease vector Aedes albopictus (Ae. albopictus) has rapidly spread around the globe. The spread of this species raises serious public health concerns. Here, we model the present distribution and the future climatic suitability of Europe for this vector in the face of climate change. In order to achieve the most realistic current prediction and future projection, we compare the performance of four different modelling approaches, differentiated by the selection of climate variables (based on expert knowledge vs. statistical criteria) and by the geographical range of presence records (native range vs. global range).First, models of the native and global range were built with MaxEnt and were either based on (1) statistically selected climatic input variables or (2) input variables selected with expert knowledge from the literature. Native models show high model performance (AUC: 0.91-0.94) for the native range, but do not predict the European distribution well (AUC: 0.70-0.72). Models based on the global distribution of the species, however, were able to identify all regions where Ae. albopictus is currently established, including Europe (AUC: 0.89-0.91).In a second step, the modelled bioclimatic envelope of the global range was projected to future climatic conditions in Europe using two emission scenarios implemented in the regional climate model COSMO-CLM for three time periods 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100. For both global-driven models, the results indicate that climatically suitable areas for the establishment of Ae. albopictus will increase in western and central Europe already in 2011-2040 and with a temporal delay in eastern Europe. On the other hand, a decline in climatically suitable areas in southern Europe is pronounced in the Expert knowledge based model. Our projections appear unaffected by non-analogue climate, as this is not detected by Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface analysis. The generated risk maps can aid in identifying suitable habitats for Ae. albopictus and hence support monitoring and control activities to avoid disease vector establishment. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {As developing countries give priority to economic growth, the effects of development threaten natural habitats and species distributions. Over the course of two decades, Vietnam has rapidly developed, especially in the expansion of agricultural production. However, no study has quantitatively measured the effects of recent human impact on the effects of past species distributions in Vietnam. We use locality data collected from multiple natural history collections, including several in Vietnam, to infer past species distributions. We assess habitat availability of five common babbler species (Aves: Timaliidae) using distribution models with data prior to rapid development that followed political reform. Overlaying the Global Human Influence Index with predicted distributions highlights the human impact on these distributions. Three important patterns emerge: (1) human impact influences common Timaliidae distributions similarly, (2) widespread species distributions show higher fragmentation due to human influence compared to narrowly distributed species in Vietnam, and (3) less than 20{\%} of distributions overlap with nationally declared protected areas. We emphasize that conservation efforts should not only prioritize individual species, but also focus efforts on a regional scale, and that the use of museum data can be highly informative in conservation analyses. There are current obstacles to enforcing conservation of Vietnam's already fragmented habitats, but our results suggest there is still time to reevaluate conservation approaches. {\textcopyright} Laurel R.

abstract = {Aim: To quantify the consequences of major threats to biodiversity, such as climate and land-use change, it is important to use explicit measures of species persistence, such as extinction risk. The extinction risk of metapopulations can be approximated through simple models, providing a regional snapshot of the extinction probability of a species. We evaluated the extinction risk of three species under different climate change scenarios in three different regions of the Mexican cloud forest, a highly fragmented habitat that is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Location: Cloud forests in Mexico. Methods: Using Maxent, we estimated the potential distribution of cloud forest for three different time horizons (2030, 2050 and 2080) and their overlap with protected areas. Then, we calculated the extinction risk of three contrasting vertebrate species for two scenarios: (1) climate change only (all suitable areas of cloud forest through time) and (2) climate and land-use change (only suitable areas within a currently protected area), using an explicit patch-occupancy approximation model and calculating the joint probability of all populations becoming extinct when the number of remaining patches was less than five. Results: Our results show that the extent of environmentally suitable areas for cloud forest in Mexico will sharply decline in the next 70 years. We discovered that if all habitat outside protected areas is transformed, then only species with small area requirements are likely to persist. With habitat loss through climate change only, high dispersal rates are sufficient for persistence, but this requires protection of all remaining cloud forest areas. Main conclusions: Even if high dispersal rates mitigate the extinction risk of species due to climate change, the synergistic impacts of changing climate and land use further threaten the persistence of species with higher area requirements. Our approach for assessing the impacts of threats on biodiversity is particularly useful when there is little time or data for detailed population viability analyses. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {1.White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging disease of hibernating North American bats that is caused by the cold-growing fungus Geomyces destructans. Since first observed in the winter of 2007, WNS has led to unprecedented mortality in several species of bats and may threaten more than 15 additional hibernating bat species if it continues across the continent. Although the exact means by which fungal infection causes mortality are undetermined, available evidence suggests a strong role of winter environmental conditions in disease mortality. 2.By 2010, the fungus G. destructans was detected in new areas of North America far from the area it was first observed, as well as in eight European bat species in different countries, yet mortality was not observed in many of these new areas of North America or in any part of Europe. This could be because of the differences in the fungus, rates of disease progression and/or in life-history or physiological traits of the affected bat species between different regions. Infection of bats by G. destructans without associated mortality might also suggest that certain environmental conditions might have to co-occur with fungal infection to cause mortality. 3.We tested the environmental conditions hypothesis using Maxent to map and model landscape surface conditions associated with WNS mortality. This approach was unique in that we modelled possible requisite environmental conditions for disease mortality and not simply the presence of the causative agent. 4.The top predictors of WNS mortality were land use/land cover types, mean air temperature of wettest quarter, elevation, frequency of precipitation and annual temperature range. Model results suggest that WNS mortality is most likely to occur in landscapes that are higher in elevation and topographically heterogeneous, drier and colder during winter, and more seasonally variable than surrounding landscapes. 5.Synthesis and applications. This study mapped the most likely environmental surface conditions associated with bat mortality owing to WNS in the north-eastern United Sates; maps can be used for selection of priority monitoring sites. Our results provide a starting point from which to investigate and predict the potential spread and population impacts of this catastrophic emerging disease. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Background: Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) as well as climate are likely to affect the geographic distribution of malaria vectors and parasites in the coming decades. At present, malaria transmission is concentrated mainly in the Amazon basin where extensive agriculture, mining, and logging activities have resulted in changes to local and regional hydrology, massive loss of forest cover, and increased contact between malaria vectors and hosts. Methods: Employing presence-only records, bioclimatic, topographic, hydrologic, LULC and human population data, we modeled the distribution of malaria and two of its dominant vectors, Anopheles darlingi, and Anopheles nuneztovari s.l. in northern South America using the species distribution modeling platform Maxent. Results: Results from our land change modeling indicate that about 70,000 km2 of forest land would be lost by 2050 and 78,000 km2 by 2070 compared to 2010. The Maxent model predicted zones of relatively high habitat suitability for malaria and the vectors mainly within the Amazon and along coastlines. While areas with malaria are expected to decrease in line with current downward trends, both vectors are predicted to experience range expansions in the future. Elevation, annual precipitation and temperature were influential in all models both current and future. Human population mostly affected An. darlingi distribution while LULC changes influenced An. nuneztovari s.l. distribution. Conclusion: As the region tackles the challenge of malaria elimination, investigations such as this could be useful for planning and management purposes and aid in predicting and addressing potential impediments to elimination. {\textcopyright} 2015 Alimi et al.},

abstract = {Heat stress, as a consequence of global warming, can have a profound effect on dairy cattle in South Africa. In this paper, current milk production data of Holstein dairy herds on pasture in South Africa, together with climate variables related to heat stress, were used to model and identify geographical areas for optimal milk production under current and future climatic conditions. To model the influence of heat stress on milk production of Holstein dairy herds on pasture in South Africa, the maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling technique was used in a novel approach to model and map optimal milk-producing areas. Geographical locations of farms with top milk-producing Holstein herds on pasture were used as presence-only data points. Only three of a possible eight climate variables that made significant contributions to the model were included, namely evaporation rate, relative humidity and mean annual temperature. The modelling technique showed good capability to capture the geographical influence of heat stress on milk production of Holstein dairy cattle and to reconstruct this relationship in sites where no data were available. The method performed well with low test omission rates, an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.929, and mean training data predictive rate of 0.66 (SD = 0.13). The modelled map indicated optimal milk production areas in the eastern parts of South Africa, which correlates well with the geographical influence of heat stress as represented by the temperature humidity index for the country. Future climate change projections (2046-2065) were used to predict optimal milk-producing areas for the future, indicating progressive shrinking of currently suitable areas and a geographical shift towards the southern parts of the east coast of South Africa. Possible long-term viable alternatives are suggested, including changes in nutrition and replacing existing breeds with more heat tolerant genotypes.},

abstract = {Including the distance species are able to move in predictive models improves conservation practice. Bird inventory projects carried out from 1993 to 2004 in Taiwan provide an opportunity to investigate the relationships among species distribution, movement distance, and the environment. We compared projected distributions of 17 Taiwanese endemic bird species using what we called the Standard Method (i.e. movement distance is zero) and what we called the Buffer Method (i.e. movement distance is longer than zero) in three presence-only models (GARP, MAXENT and LIVES). The Standard Method used species original occurrence records directly while the Buffer Method expanded the occurrence of species to areas 1km2 around each recorded location. We first tested the efficacy of the Buffer Method using ten common species of the 17, and then applied the method to two rare species of the 17. For both the common and rare species, the distributions predicted by the two methods showed slight but important differences. The Buffer Method for all species had a higher average predictive probability, while the Standard Method had a higher maximum predictive probability. Most of the values for the area under the curve (AUC) were over 0.8 with the exceptions of Taiwan Barbet (Megalaima nuchalis) and Taiwan Hwamei (Garrulax taewanus), which have recently separated from Indochinese Barbet (Megalaima annamensis) and Chinese Hwamei (Garrulax canorus), and since 2008 and 2006 have been regarded as species endemic to the study area. Kappa values showed good performance for all species using both methods. The Buffer Method, however, resulted in significantly higher sensitivity and accuracy values for all models of species (p{\textless}0.05). We conclude that when modeling species distribution including the area where the species was censused along with areas within the minimum movement areas better defines the surrounding areas that might supplement core habitat requirements. Therefore, using the Buffer Method, species surrounding distribution can be obtained which provides a better understanding of the species distributions. Given that distribution size is a key to the conservation of species, we suggest the Buffer Method can be used in conservation planning. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background: Ornithodoros turicata is a veterinary and medically important argasid tick that is recognized as a vector of the relapsing fever spirochete Borrelia turicatae and African swine fever virus. Historic collections of O. turicata have been recorded from Latin America to the southern United States. However, the geographic distribution of this vector is poorly understood in relation to environmental variables, their hosts, and consequently the pathogens they transmit. Methodology: Localities of O. turicata were generated by performing literature searches, evaluating records from the United States National Tick Collection and the Symbiota Collections of Arthropods Network, and by conducting field studies. Maximum entropy species distribution modeling (Maxent) was used to predict the current distribution of O. turicata. Vertebrate host diversity and GIS analyses of their distributions were used to ascertain the area of shared occupancy of both the hosts and vector. Conclusions and Significance: Our results predicted previously unrecognized regions of the United States with habitat that may maintain O. turicata and could guide future surveillance efforts for a tick capable of transmitting high–consequence pathogens to human and animal populations. {\textcopyright} 2016, Public Library of Science.

abstract = {Spatial records of species are commonly misidentified, which can change the predicted distribution of a species obtained from a species distribution model (SDM). Experiments were undertaken to predict the distribution of real and simulated species using MaxEnt and presence-only data "contaminated" with varying rates of misidentification error. Additionally, the difference between the niche of the target and contaminating species was varied. The results show that species misidentification errors may act to contract or expand the predicted distribution of a species while shifting the predicted distribution towards that of the contaminating species. Furthermore the magnitude of the effects was positively related to the ecological distance between the species' niches and the size of the error rates. Critically, the magnitude of the effects was substantial even when using small error rates, smaller than common average rates reported in the literature, which may go unnoticed while using a standard evaluation method, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Finally, the effects outlined were shown to impact negatively on practical applications that use SDMs to identify priority areas, commonly selected for various purposes such as management. The results highlight that species misidentification should not be neglected in species distribution modeling. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Climate is a major driver of invertebrate species distributions and climate change is expected to shift pest assemblages and pest prevalence across Australia. At this stage, little is known of how individual species will respond to climate change. We have mapped the current distribution for each of the three pest Penthaleus spp. in Australia and built ecological niche models for each species using the correlative modelling software, maxent. Predictor variables useful for describing the climate space of each species were determined and the models were projected into a range of future climate change scenarios to assess how climate change may alter species-specific distribution patterns in Australia. The distributions of the three cryptic Penthaleus spp. are best described with different sets of climatic variables. Suitable climate space for all species decreases under the climate change scenarios investigated in the present study. The models also indicate that the assemblage of Penthaleus spp. is likely to change across Australia, particularly in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria. These results show the distributions of the three Penthaleus spp. are correlated with different climatic variables, and that regional control of mite pests is likely to change in the future. A further understanding of ecological and physiological processes that may influence the distribution and pest status of mites is required. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Aim: Species often remain undetected at sites where they are present. However, the impact of imperfect detection on species distribution models (SDMs) is not fully appreciated. In this paper we evaluate the influence of imperfect detection on the calibration and discrimination capacity of SDMs. We compare the performance of three types of SDMs: (1) a technique based on presence-absence data, (2) a technique based on presence-background data, and (3) a technique based on detection/non-detection data that accounts for imperfect detection. Innovation: We use simulations to evaluate the impacts of imperfect detection in SDMs. This allows us to assess model performance with respect to the true objective of the models: the estimation of species distributions. We study a range of scenarios of occupancy and detection based on ecologically plausible environmental relationships and identify the circumstances in which imperfect detection affects model calibration and discrimination. We show that imperfect detection can substantially reduce the inferential and predictive accuracy of presence-absence and presence-background methods that do not account for detectability. While calibration is always affected, the influence on discrimination depends on the relationship of detectability and environmental variables. Main conclusions: The performance of a model should be assessed with respect to its objectives. Comparative studies that intend to assess the performance of an SDM by evaluating its ability to predict detections rather than presences fail to reveal the benefits of accounting for detectability. Disregarding imperfect detection can have severe consequences for SDM performance, and hence for the estimation of species distributions. To date, this issue has been largely ignored in the SDM literature. Simultaneously modelling occupancy and detection does not necessarily require a greater sampling effort, but rather that data are collected so that they are informative about detectability. We recommend that consideration of imperfect detection become standard practice for species distribution modelling. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

The species' survival in the wild depends on identifying suitable habitat for establishing bison metapopulations via reintroductions of new herds. We assessed European Bison habitat across the Carpathian Mountains, a stronghold of European Bison and one of the only places where a viable bison metapopulation may be possible. We used maximum entropy models to analyze herd range maps and habitat use data from radio-collared bison to identify key habitat variables and map European Bison habitat across the entire Carpathian ecoregion (210,000 km2). Forest cover (primarily core and perforated forests) and variables linked to human disturbance best predict bison habitat suitability. Bison show no clear preference for particular forest types but prefer managed grasslands over fallow and abandoned fields. Several large, suitable, but currently unoccupied habitat patches exist, particularly in the eastern Carpathians. This available suitable habitat suggests that European Bison have an opportunity to establish a viable Carpathian metapopulation, especially if recent trends of declining human pressure and reforestation of abandoned farmland continue. Our results also confirm the suitability of a proposed Romanian reintroduction site. Establishing the first European Bison metapopulation would be a milestone in efforts to conserve this species in the wild and demonstrate a significant and hopeful step towards conserving large grazers and their ecological roles in human-dominated landscapes across the globe. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These three species exhibit typical deciduousness and are widely distributed by SDTF in South America, being important in studies of the historical and evolutionary processes experienced by this ecosystem. The modeling of the potential geographic distribution of species was done by the method of maximum entropy (Maxent). We verified a general expansion of suitable areas for occurrence of the three species in future (c.a., 18{\%}), although there was reduction of areas with high environmental suitability in Caatinga region. Precipitation of wettest quarter and temperature seasonality were the predictor variables that most contributed to our models. Climatic changes can provide more severe and longer dry season with increasing temperature and tree mortality in tropics. On this scenario, areas currently occupied by rainforest and savannas could become more suitable for occurrence of the SDTF specialist trees, whereas regions occupied by Caatinga could not support the future level of unsustainable (e.g., aridity). Long-term multidisciplinary studies are necessary to make reliable predictions of the plant's adaptation strategies and responses to climate changes in dry forest at community level. Based on the high deforestation rate, endemism and threat, public policies to minimize the effects of climate change on the biodiversity found within SDTFs must be undertaken rapidly. {\textcopyright} 2015, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

abstract = {Aim: Numerous studies have examined potential responses of terrestrial biotas to future climate change, but fewer have considered marine realms. We forecast how marine molluscan faunas might respond to environmental change over the remainder of this century. We test the hypotheses that suitable areas will shift northwards for studied species, and that species will show varied responses to future climate change. Location: North and South America and the Caribbean. Methods: We generated ecological niche models (in GARP and Maxent) for 14 ecologically, economically and potentially medically important mollusc species, using present-day summaries and future forecasts of climate from the Hadley Centre and known species occurrence data from natural history collections. Niche models were used to forecast potential distributions according to three scenarios of future change for three time slices. Results: Northern extremes of suitability are predicted to shift northwards for only three (GARP) or four (Maxent) of the 14 species, whereas the southern edge of suitability is predicted to shift southwards for seven (GARP) and one (Maxent) of the 14 species. When changes in the geographical centroids of suitability are considered, no significant poleward shifts are anticipated for individual species. Instead, half of the study species (many economically important) experience substantial ({\textgreater} 20{\%}) loss of suitable environmental area, even under the lowest-emission future climate scenario. Furthermore, the direction and magnitude of the response to predicted climate change is species-specific. Main conclusions: We do not find a coherent pattern of areas with suitable environments expanding at high-latitude range boundaries, with simultaneous contraction at their low-latitude boundaries. Tropical marine molluscs may thus show varied responses as average temperatures warm. These results contrast with trends among terrestrial and other marine species, which are rapidly shifting their ranges to higher latitudes. Conversely, the differing responses of these species to future warming are consistent with responses of species to past episodes of change, as observed in the fossil record. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Habitat suitability, dispersal potential, and fragmentation influence the distribution of stream fishes; however, their relative influence and interacting effects on species distributions are poorly understood, which may result in uncertain outcomes of river rehabilitation and conservation. Using empirical data describing 17 relatively common stream fishes, we combine (1) species habitat suitability models (MaxEnt) with a (2) species dispersal model (FIDIMO) and a (3) worst-case scenario of the influence of river fragmentation on dispersal. Using generalized linear mixed models, we aimed to uncover the role of these factors in explaining the probability of presence. Simulations over nine years allowed for assessing the relative importance of dispersal over time for structuring species occurrences vs. the importance of habitat suitability. Models combining all three structuring factors performed consistently better in predicting the spatial occurrence patterns than models including only single factors. Our results confirmed that distribution patterns of stream fishes are jointly controlled by species dispersal and habitat suitability. An increase of 0.1 habitat suitability probability more than doubled the odds of species occurrence; an increase of 0.1 dispersal probability yielded a 14-fold increase of the odds of species occurrence. Temporal simulations revealed that over short time frames (1-2 years) dispersal from nearby source populations is four times more important than habitat suitability for species presence. However, over longer time periods, the importance of habitat suitability increases relative to the importance of dispersal. Surprisingly, fragmentation by migration barriers did not appear as a significant driver of occurrence patterns. Concluding, these findings demonstrate the importance of the spatial arrangement of suitable habitats and potential source populations, as well as their relative position in relation to barriers. We emphasize considering the direction of connections within river networks and the dispersal abilities of fishes, as well as providing (access to) new, suitable habitat for successful river rehabilitation. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.},

To alleviate overfitting with a very large number of features, we propose applying the maxent principle with relaxed constraints on the expectations of the features. By convex duality, this turns out to be equivalent to finding the Gibbs distribution minimizing a regularized version of the empirical log loss. We prove non-asymptotic bounds showing that, with respect to the true underlying distribution, this relaxed version of maxent produces density estimates that are almost as good as the best possible. These bounds are in terms of the deviation of the feature empirical averages relative to their true expectations, a number that can be bounded using standard uniform-convergence techniques. In particular, this leads to bounds that drop quickly with the number of samples, and that depend very moderately on the number or complexity of the features. We also derive and prove convergence for both sequential-update and parallel-update algorithms. Finally, we briefly describe experiments on data relevant to the modeling of species geographical distributions.},

abstract = {The performance of statistical methods for modeling resource selection by animals is difficult to evaluate with field data because true selection patterns are unknown. Simulated data based on a known probability distribution, though, can be used to evaluate statistical methods. Models should estimate true selection patterns if they are to be useful in analyzing and interpreting field data. We used simulation techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of three statistical methods used in modeling resource selection. We generated 25 use locations per animal and included 10, 20, 40, or 80 animals in samples of use locations. To simulate species of different mobility, we generated use locations at four levels according to a known probability distribution across DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR) in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, USA. We either generated 5 random locations per use location or 10,000 random locations (total) within 4 predetermined areas around use locations to determine how the definition of availability and the number of random locations affected results. We analyzed simulated data using discrete choice, logistic-regression, and a maximum entropy method (Maxent). We used a simple linear regression of estimated and known probability distributions and area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) to evaluate the performance of each method. Each statistical method was affected differently by number of animals and random locations used in analyses, level at which selection of resources occurred, and area considered available. Discrete-choice modeling resulted in precise and accurate estimates of the true probability distribution when the area in which use locations were generated was ≥ the area defined to be available. Logistic-regression models were unbiased and precise when the area in which use locations were generated and the area defined to be available were the same size; the fit of these models improved with increased numbers of random locations. Maxent resulted in unbiased and precise estimates of the known probability distribution when the area in which use locations were generated was small (home-range level) and the area defined to be available was large (study area). Based on AUC analyses, all models estimated the selection distribution better than random chance. Results from AUC analyses, however, often contradicted results of the linear regression method used to evaluate model performance. Discrete-choice modeling was best able to estimate the known selection distribution in our study area regardless of sample size or number of random locations used in the analyses, but we recommend further studies using simulated data over different landscapes and different resource metrics to confirm our results. Our study offers an approach and guidance for others interested in assessing the utility of techniques for modeling resource selection in their study area. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

We tested whether the range expansion of the weed Silene vulgaris across Europe fit the classical model of postglacial expansion from southern refugia, or followed known routes of the expansion of human agricultural practices. We used species distribution modeling to predict spatial patterns of postglacial expansion and contrasted these with the patterns of human agricultural expansion. A population genetic analysis using microsatellite loci was then used to test which scenario was better supported by spatial patterns of genetic diversity and structure. Genetic diversity was highest in southern Europe and declined with increasing latitude. Locations of ancestral demes from genetic cluster analysis were consistent with areas of predicted refugia. Species distribution models showed the most suitable habitat in the LGM on the southern coasts of Europe. These results support the typical postglacial northward colonization from southern refugia while refuting the east-to-west agricultural spread as the main mode of expansion for S. vulgaris. We know that S. vulgaris has recently colonized many regions (including North America and other continents) through human-mediated dispersal, but there is no evidence for a direct link between the Neolithic expansion of agriculture and current patterns of genetic diversity of S. vulgaris in Europe. Therefore, the history of range expansion of S. vulgaris likely began with postglacial expansion after the LGM, followed by more recent global dispersal by humans. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

abstract = {Due to their secretive habits, predicting the pattern of spatial distribution of small carnivores has been typically challenging, yet for conservation management it is essential to understand the association between this group of animals and environmental factors. We applied maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) to build distribution models and identify environmental predictors including bioclimatic variables, forest and land cover type, topography, vegetation index and anthropogenic variables for six small carnivore species in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. Species occurrence records were collated from camera-traps and vehicle transects during the years 2010 and 2011. We used the average training gain from forty model runs for each species to select the best set of predictors. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic plot (ROC) ranged from 0.81 to 0.93 for the training data and 0.72 to 0.87 for the test data. In habitat models for F. chaus , P. hermaphroditus, and H. smithii "distance to village" and precipitation of the warmest quarter emerged as some of the most important variables. "Distance to village" and aspect were important for V. indica while "distance to village" and precipitation of the coldest quarter were significant for H. vitticollis. "Distance to village", precipitation of the warmest quarter and land cover were influential variables in the distribution of H. edwardsii. The map of predicted probabilities of occurrence showed potentially suitable habitats accounting for 46 km2 of the reserve for F. chaus, 62 km2 for V. indica, 30 km2 for P. hermaphroditus, 63 km2 for H. vitticollis, 45 km2 for H. smithii and 28 km2 for H. edwardsii. Habitat heterogeneity driven by the east-west climatic gradient was correlated with the spatial distribution of small carnivores. This study exemplifies the usefulness of modeling small carnivore distribution to prioritize and direct conservation planning for habitat specialists in southern India. {\textcopyright} 2013 Kalle et al.},

abstract = {Despite their economic and environmental impacts, there have been relatively few attempts to model the distribution of invasive ant species. In this study, the potential distribution of six invasive ant species in New Zealand are modelled using three fundamentally different methods (BIOCLIM, DOMAIN, MAXENT). Species records were obtained from museum collections in New Zealand. There was a significant relationship between the length of time an exotic species had been present in New Zealand and its geographic range. This is the first time such a time lag has been described for exotic ant species, and shows there is a considerable time lag in their spread. For example, it has taken many species several decades (40-60 years) to obtain a distribution of 17-25{\%} of New Zealand regions. For all six species, BIOCLIM performed poorly compared to the other two modelling methods. BIOCLIM had lower AUC scores and higher omission error, suggesting BIOCLIM models under-predicted the potential distribution of each species. Omission error was significantly higher between models fitted with all 19 climate variables compared to those models with fewer climate variables for BIOCLIM, but not DOMAIN or MAXENT. Widespread species had a greater commission error. A number of regions in New Zealand are predicted to be climatically suitable for the six species modelled, particularly coastal and lowland areas of both the North and South Islands. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

abstract = {In the last few decades, the crested porcupine (Hystrix cristata L., 1758) showed a marked range expansion in Italy. Published and unpublished material was collected to reconstruct this phenomenon. Data were gathered by means of: (i) specific papers on crested porcupine distribution and more generic books and articles, (ii) expert collaboration in various Italian regions and (iii) information from the national Vertebrates mailing list. Until the 1970s, H. cristata was only present in Central and Southern Italy, mostly in the western part. Since 1978, the porcupine has been protected by Italian national law. The species first crossed the Apennines from the Tyrrhenian coast to the Marche, where the expansion to the north may have begun, and then reached the northernmost regions. An analysis of the potential distribution of the species was performed in a species distribution modeling framework (Maxent). The model suggested a high suitability of most of the Central and Southern Italian Peninsula for H. cristata, including the two major islands. Northern Italy proved suitable for the species' establishment only in some central and western areas of the Po Valley. The core areas of the Apennines and of the Alps, as well as some areas characterized by low annual rainfall, were predicted as unsuitable. Historical and social factors related to the progressive urbanization and the consequent abandonment of the traditional land use in mountain landscapes probably helped the re-expansion of forests and uncultivated fields. Three introduced populations have been detected in Sardinia, Liguria and the province of Varese. In order to make the data collected easily consultable and to give people the opportunity to contribute to a continuous updating of the distributional map of the species, a web page dedicated to H. cristata was set up, in the framework of an open-source wildlife mapping project. {\textcopyright} 2013 Unione Zoologica Italiana.},

Several environmental predictor data sets at 1 km2 spatial resolution were used in combination with the Maxent algorithm (Phillips et al., 2004), namely (1) phenological metrics derived from the Terra-MODIS 16-day vegetation indices product MOD13A2 averaged over the seven years of the study period from 2001 to 2007, (2) topographic data (elevation, slope, and aspect) of the SRTM mission, and (3) a series of bioclimatic variables (WorldClim, Hijmans et al., 2005) derived from monthly temperature and rainfall values. Different model scenarios were compared and showed that remote sensing data contributed significantly to discover habitat characteristics even within similar climatic conditions. Moreover, a sharper delineation of the predicted areas and better exclusion of regions that had suffered land cover change was possible. The improved distribution maps can contribute to long-term and sustainable conservation planning and management of biodiversity hotspots.},

abstract = {An essential component of conservation science is repeated surveys over time to monitor species that might be responding to local factors, such as land management, or more broadly to global change. A systematic survey of the avifauna of Cape York Peninsula was conducted in the late 1990s and early 2000s providing an ideal basal dataset for measuring change in the avifauna. A subset (n{\textgreater}600) of these sites, primarily within savanna landscapes, was selected for re-survey in 2008 to investigate changes in bird communities on Cape York Peninsula. Changes in mean species richness varied across the study area (decreases in 59 grid cells and increases in 43) with no apparent pattern. Significant change in reporting rates was recorded in 30 species. Four sedentary and highly detectable species declined (Bar-shouldered Dove, Brown Treecreeper, Sulphur-crested Cockatoo and Pale-headed Rosella) and five increased (Peaceful Dove, Pheasant Coucal, Weebill, White-throated Honeyeater and Yellow Oriole). Habitat preference for the species that showed change remained relatively stable between the two survey periods. Some species that were recorded in very low numbers in the original survey and are considered to be threatened (Brown Treecreeper, Black-faced Woodswallow) remained in very low numbers or decreased in our survey suggesting that there has been no regional recovery of these species. Long-term monitoring can describe important patterns of species change over time, though in the case of large, highly seasonal environments like the tropical savannas, signals of change may manifest over decades rather than annually. {\textcopyright} 2011 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.},

abstract = {Austrocedrus chilensis forests suffer from a disease caused by Phytophthora austrocedrae, which is found often in wet soils. We applied three widely used modelling techniques, with different data requirements, to model disease potential distribution under current environmental conditions: Mahalanobis distance, Maxent and Logistic regression. Each model was built using field data of health condition and landscape layers of environmental conditions (distance to streams, slope, aspect, elevation, mean annual precipitation and soil pH NaF). We compared model predictions by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and Kappa statistics. A reasonable ability to predict observed disease distribution was found for each of the three modelling techniques. However, Maxent and Logistic regression presented the best predictive performance, with significant differences with respect to the Mahalanobis distance model. Our results suggested that if good absence data are available, Logistic regression should be used in order to better discriminate sites with high risk of disease. On the other hand, if absence data are not available or doubtful, Maxent could be a very good option. The three models predicted that around 50{\%} (49-56{\%}) of the currently asymptomatic forests are located on sites at risk of disease according to abiotic factors. Most of these asymptomatic forests surround the current diseased patches, at distances lower than 100 m from diseased patches. Management considerations and the scope of future studies were discussed in this article. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {1. Under the effects of rapid environmental change, such as climate change and land degradation, assessment of plant species potential distribution is becoming increasingly important for conservation purposes. Moreover, land administrators need reliable predictions of species suitability for planning a wide range of management activities. 2. In this study, we used the recent Maxent algorithm for modelling the niche of Arnica montana within a Site of Community Importance in the Alps, with the ultimate aim of providing a rigorous evidence base for management of this locally threatened species. We built a final suitability map taking into account (i) the minimization of spatial autocorrelation through the use of a constrained random split of sampled data; (ii) the use of a stepwise selection of predictors in order to obtain a reduced model containing only meaningful variables; (iii) the comparison of the predictive power of three sets of environmental predictors; (iv) the identification of the most suitable areas by overlaying predictions of three competing models; (v) the use of divergence maps as a complement to conventional performance comparison assessments. 3. Maxent improved accuracy both on training and test data sets. Elevation, geomorphology and hosting habitats performed as effective primary predictors. A reduced model based on the outcomes of a preliminary stepwise selection analysis of predictors gave the best accuracy score on test data. Two parts of the study area have been selected for management as a result of areas of agreement between the three competing models. 4. Synthesis and applications. There remain important methodological issues that need to be improved in order to increase confidence in niche modelling and ensure that reintroduction and management activities for threatened or rare plant species are based on reliable distribution models. Modellers can improve predictions of plant distribution by addressing methodological topics that are often overlooked, as demonstrated for A. montana in this study. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

Our results show that altitude combined with isothermality, temperature seasonality, annual precipitation and precipitation of the wettest month can be used to successfully model habitat suitability of A. arabiensis. Based on these five key factors, our results show that areas that are highly suitable for A. arabiensis are generally in the north, northeast, south and south eastern parts of Zimbabwe. In fact, our results show that all the five factors had AUC values ≥70{\%} which is classified as good for predictive purposes. The results of our Maxent model overallshow AUC values of 0.84 for training and 0.88 for test data. In addition, our results also show that the habitat suitability model positively correlated (p{\textless}0.05) with malaria incidences recorded at health facilities for the period 1974-1981 and the years 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999 although the correlations are weak.

Eastern Central Asian desert (ECAD) is one of the taxonomically important geographical units. Modeling the species geographical distribution in the area is challenging because the known distribution sites of species necessary for model formation are limited. To identify methods most suitable for modeling in these conditions, three leading models namely the Maximum Entropy (Maxent), Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) and Domain at predicting distributions of 13 endemic genera in ECAD were taken into account. The chosen species in this area vary in distribution characteristics and with available distribution points ranging from 8 to 109. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method and the jackknife test were employed to evaluate model predictivity. For species with occurrence localities ranging from 27 to 109, we found that Maxent and Domain performed similarly according to the area under the ROC curve (AUC), however; the visualized predictions of Domain were found greatly affected by the spatial structure of the know distribution sites of species. GARP presented the lowest AUC values among the three methods tested here and overprediction. For species with limited occurrence localities ranging from 8 to 16, jackknife tests indicated that both Maxent and GARP yielded statistically significant predictions, while Domain failed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society for Plant Research.

We relied on four environmental factors: mean annual temperature and precipitation, elevation, and vegetation type. A "sample site" was defined as a 20 km × 20 km area (equal to NEON's airborne observation platform [AOP] footprint), within which each 1 km 2 cell was evaluated for each environmental factor. After each model run, the most environmentally dissimilar site was selected from all potential sample sites. The iterative selection of eight sites captured approximately 80{\%} of the environmental envelope of the domain, an improvement over stratified random sampling and simple random designs for sample site selection. This approach can be widely used for cost-efficient selection of survey and monitoring sites. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the authors.},

Native non-food bioenergy plants are also considered to be a wise choice to reduce the threat of invasive plants. In this study, the impacts of climate change (a consensus of IPCC scenarios A2a for 2080) on the potential distribution of nine non-food bioenergy plants native to China (viz., Pistacia chinensis, Cornus wilsoniana, Xanthoceras sorbifolia, Vernicia fordii, Sapium sebiferum, Miscanthus sinensis, M. floridulus, M. sacchariflorus and Arundo donax) were analyzed using a MaxEnt species distribution model. The suitable habitats of the nine non-food plants were distributed in the regions east of the Mongolian Plateau and the Tibetan Plateau, where the arable land is primarily used for food production. Thus, the large-scale cultivation of those plants for energy production will have to rely on the marginal lands. The variables of "precipitation of the warmest quarter" and "annual mean temperature" were the most important bioclimatic variables for most of the nine plants according to the MaxEnt modeling results. Global warming in coming decades may result in a decrease in the extent of suitable habitat in the tropics but will have little effect on the total distribution area of each plant. The results indicated that it will be possible to grow these plants on marginal lands within these areas in the future. This work should be beneficial for the domestication and cultivation of those bioenergy plants and should facilitate land-use planning for bioenergy crops in China.

Among these C. bezziana, L. cuprina and W. magnifica with approximately 882 case reports were the principal agents of traumatic myiasis. The species W. magnifica is a first report from Pakistan. In order to investigate spatial distribution of these dominant species we used MaxEnt niche model. Our results revealed a well-established occurrence of C. bezziana and L. cuprina in the four eco-regions while W. magnifica is currently contained in the Submontane Region. Several hot spot areas of infestation were detected all characterized by high human population density showing synanthropic nature of these species. Wohlfahrtia magnifica was excluded from Northern Montane Region with severe winters and Southern Indus Plains with harsh summers revealing that invasive species are initially sensitive to extreme of temperatures. Presence of L. cuprina in the wet areas of North Humid Belt (Maximum annual precipitation: 1641 mm) depicted a moisture preference of the species. In perspective of changing climate and future predictions of severe events such as droughts and flooding in NWP, W. magnifica can potentially alter the species composition. Considering these findings in an eco-geographically dynamic region of Pakistan we predict that two factors (1) Growing human population (2) Climatic conditions, equally contribute to range shift of synanthropic species. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

In critical periods, such as winter, when the importance of intraspecific competition diminish, species may relax their environmental requirements widening their ecological niche to exploit the scarcer trophic resources more efficiently in comparison with spring. Those variations in niche width may implicate seasonal expansions/retractions in species distribution. In this sense, an integrated knowledge on the spatial arrangement of breeding and wintering suitable patches is essential to infer seasonal movements (migratory connectivity). This paper shows that little bustard environmental preferences were more predictable and complex (controlled by a larger number of environmental factors) in spring than in winter, when potential distribution and ecological niche width were slightly larger. In spring, habitat variables (i.e. percentage of dry crops and pasturelands and altitude) ruled species' distribution; while, winter pattern was driven by mixed criteria, based on both habitat and climate (i.e. percentage of dry crops and wastelands and winter rainfall). Suitable patches were more connected across spatial scales in winter than in spring, i.e. landscape was perceived as less fragmented. The overlap between potential breeding and wintering distribution areas was high. In fact, most of the predicted wintering areas coincided or showed high connectedness with predicted breeding patches. Conversely, there were significant breeding patches that were predicted with low suitability, showing little connectedness with potential winter areas. Spring habitat was a better predictor of little bustard's wintering range than vice versa, which has clear management implications (preserving breeding sites closer to wintering areas ensures the conservation of a larger proportion of the total distribution range). This is an example of how predictive large-scale modeling procedures can contribute to the optimization of land management aimed at species conservation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Dengue is considered the most important vector borne virus disease worldwide placing some 2.5 billion people at risk globally. Despite the public health concern about dengue fever, spatially explicit suitability assessments for this disease are limited due to data restrictions and the challenges posed by the complexity of the interactions among its risk factors, which involve social, economic, and ecological processes. This paper demonstrates an empirical approach to identify suitable areas for dengue fever using species distribution modeling and evaluates the relative contribution of climatic and socio-economic factors as dengue fever suitability determinants. Several models showing the potential distribution of dengue fever within all the Mexican municipalities are produced using different sets of predictor variables. The results suggest that at the scale of this study the climatic variables were more important determinants of suitability for dengue fever than the socio-economic variables considered in this study. All the models perform well (average testing AUC about 0.8) and show similar patterns. The model with the least number of variables and best performance includes the variables minimum temperature of the coldest month, mean temperature of the wettest quarter, and annual precipitation. However, there is not a high variability of AUC scores among the models generated. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study, we used the distribution of the wild relatives of lettuce (Lactuca spp.) to investigate the applicability of Maxent species distribution models for collecting missions. Geographic origin data of genebank and herbarium specimens and climatic data of the origin locations were used as input. For Lactuca saligna, we varied the input data by omitting the specimens from different parts of the known distribution area to assess the robustness of the predicted distributions. Furthermore, we examined the accuracy of the modelling by comparing the predicted probabilities of population presence against recent expedition data for the endemic Lactuca georgica and the cosmopolitan Lactuca serriola. We found Maxent to be quite robust in its predictions, although its usefulness was higher for endemic taxa than for more widespread species. The exclusion of occurrence data from the perceived range margins of the species can result in important information about local adaptation to distinct climatic conditions.

Empirical modelling of benthic species distribution, abundance, and diversity in the Baltic Sea: evaluating the scope for predictive mapping using different modelling approaches. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 1233-1243.The predictive performance of distribution models of common benthic species in the Baltic Sea was compared using four non-linear methods: generalized additive models (GAMs), multivariate adaptive regression splines, random forest (RF), and maximum entropy modelling (MAXENT). The effects of data traits were also tested. In total, 292 occurrence models and 204 quantitative (abundance and diversity) models were assessed. The main conclusions are that (i) the spatial distribution, abundance, and diversity of benthic species in the Baltic Sea can be successfully predicted using several non-linear predictive modelling techniques; (ii) RF was the most accurate method for both models, closely followed by GAM and MAXENT; (iii) correlation coefficients of predictive performance among the modelling techniques were relatively low, suggesting that the performance of methods is related to specific responses; (iv) the differences in predictive performance among the modelling methods could only partly be explained by data traits; (v) the response prevalence was the most important explanatory variable for predictive accuracy of GAM and MAXENT on occurrence data; (vi) RF on the occurrence data was the only method sensitive to sampling density; (vii) a higher predictive accuracy of abundance models could be achieved by reducing variance in the response data and increasing the sample size. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {Questions: Vegetation mapping based on field surveys is time-consuming and expensive. Distribution modelling might be used to overcome these challenges. What is the performance of distribution modelling of vegetation compared to traditional vegetation mapping when projected locally? Does the modelling performance vary among ecosystems? Does vegetation type distribution and abundance influence the modelling performance?. Location: Gravfjellet, {\O}ystre Slidre commune, southern Norway. Methods: Two comparable neighbouring areas, each of 4 km2, were mapped for species-defined vegetation types. One area was used for model training, the other for model projection. Maximum entropy models were run for six vegetation types, two from each of the ecosystems present in the area: forest, wetland and mountain heath- and shrublands. For each ecosystem, one locally abundant and one locally rare vegetation type were tested. AUC, the area under the receiver operating curve, was used as the model selection criterion. Environmental variables (n = 9) were selected through a backwards selection scheme, and model complexity was kept low. The models were evaluated using independent data. Results: Distribution modelling of vegetation types by local projection gave high AUC values, and the results were supported by the evaluation using independent data. The modelling ability was not affected by ecosystem differences. A negative relationship between the number of points used to train the models and the AUC value before evaluation suggests that models for locally rare vegetation types had better predictive performance than the models for abundant types. This result was not significant after evaluation. Conclusion: Provided that relevant explanatory variables are available at an appropriate scale, and that field-validated training points are available, distribution modelling can be used for local projection of the six tested vegetation types from the boreal–alpine ecotone. {\textcopyright} 2016 International Association for Vegetation Science},

abstract = {It has long been considered sufficient a single method or only a descriptive diagnosis to propose a new species. Recently, many works have proposed new theoretical paradigms to consider multiple sources of evidence to support the hypothesis of new taxa within an integrative approach. Despite this, many new described species continue to be merely descriptive and without any reproducible statistical analysis to support these descriptions. We tested whether five species described as members of a species complex of the lizard genus Liolaemus from Patagonia, can be differentiated based on classical morphometric analyses and ecological niche modeling. Individuals were sampled from their type localities. Our results showed that the univariate tests and Principal Component Analyses (PCA) were more accurate to differentiate species compared to the Linear Discriminant Analyses (LDA). However, there were almost no morphometric differences between two of the analyzed species. Major differences were found in bioclimatic variables of four of the species through Maxent ENMs and PCA using the original worldclim variables. Our results partially support the hypothesis that species can be differentiated by classical morphometric analyses, and found a strong support for the hypothesis that these taxa can be differentiated through their bioclimatic niches. These two approaches based on repeatable statistical basis, can supplement qualitative descriptive diagnoses of new species of the genus Liolaemus. {\textcopyright} 2014 Magnolia Press.},

abstract = {Two of the major limitations to effective management of coral reef ecosystems are a lack of information on the spatial distribution of marine species and a paucity of data on the interacting environmental variables that drive distributional patterns. Advances in marine remote sensing, together with the novel integration of landscape ecology and advanced niche modelling techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to reliably model and map marine species distributions across many kilometres of coral reef ecosystems. We developed a multi-scale approach using three-dimensional seafloor morphology and across-shelf location to predict spatial distributions for five common Caribbean fish species. Seascape topography was quantified from high resolution bathymetry at five spatial scales (5-300 m radii) surrounding fish survey sites. Model performance and map accuracy was assessed for two high performing machine-learning algorithms: Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modelling (MaxEnt). The three most important predictors were geographical location across the shelf, followed by a measure of topographic complexity. Predictor contribution differed among species, yet rarely changed across spatial scales. BRT provided 'outstanding' model predictions (AUC = {\textgreater}0.9) for three of five fish species. MaxEnt provided 'outstanding' model predictions for two of five species, with the remaining three models considered 'excellent' (AUC = 0.8-0.9). In contrast, MaxEnt spatial predictions were markedly more accurate (92{\%} map accuracy) than BRT (68{\%} map accuracy). We demonstrate that reliable spatial predictions for a range of key fish species can be achieved by modelling the interaction between the geographical location across the shelf and the topographic heterogeneity of seafloor structure. This multi-scale, analytic approach is an important new cost-effective tool to accurately delineate essential fish habitat and support conservation prioritization in marine protected area design, zoning in marine spatial planning, and ecosystem-based fisheries management. {\textcopyright} 2011 Pittman, Brown.},

abstract = {Aim: Quantifying species abundances is costly, especially when many species are involved. To overcome this problem, several studies have predicted local abundances (at the sample unit level) from species occurrence distribution models (SODMs), with differences in predictive performance among studies. Surprisingly, the ability of SODM to predict regional abundances of an entire area of interest has never been tested, despite the fact that it is an essential parameter for species conservation and management. We tested whether local and regional abundances of 21 terrestrial bird species could be predicted from SODMs in an exhaustively surveyed island, and examined the variation explained by species-specific traits. Location: La Palma Island, Canary Islands. Methods: We firstly assessed two types of algorithms representing the two main families of SODMs. We built models using presence/absence (boosted classification trees) and presence/background (MaxEnt) data as a function of relevant environmental predictors and tested their ability to predict the observed local abundances. The predicted probabilities of occurrence (Pi) were translated into animal numbers (n′) using the revisited equation ni′ = -ln(1-Pi), and we obtained regional abundances (for the whole island). Results: Predictive ability of presence/absence models was superior than that of MaxEnt. At the regional level, the observed average densities of all species were highly predictable from occurrence probabilities (R2 = 93.5{\%}), without overall overestimation or underestimation. Interspecific variation in the accuracy of predicted regional density was largely explained (R2 = 73{\%}), with habitat breath and variation in local abundance being the traits of greatest importance. Main conclusions: Despite uncertainties associated with local predictions and the idiosyncrasies of each species, our procedures enabled us to predict regional abundances in an unbiased way. Our approach provides a cost-effective tool when a large number of species are involved. Furthermore, the influence of species-specific traits on the prediction accuracy provides insights into sampling designs for focal species. {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

Osteopilus pulchrilineatus, Osteopilus vastus, Hypsiboas heilprini, and Eleutherodactylus flavescens). Spatial analysis was performed to relate observations of the target species to environmental factors using a maximum entropy algorithm (Maxent). Results of this analysis produced maps of probability of occurrence for each species. Analysis of habitat degradation was based on a change analysis of vegetation, by evaluating trends in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) between 2000 and 2011. Results show that forest loss and species habitat loss within protected areas are smaller but similar to those extracted for the country as a whole, suggesting that the current protected area network is not effective for the maintenance of the habitat of the amphibians analyzed. Enforcement of established protection and restoration within current protected areas could facilitate the protection of up to 25.7{\%} of target amphibian habitat.

abstract = {The Chinese grouse Tetrastes sewerzowi is restricted to small mountain areas on the southeastern edge of Qinghai-Tibet plateau. Recent evidence indicates that the global climate has undergone rapid change. To assess the potential effects of climate change on Chinese grouse, we applied a maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt) method to predict the current and future distributions of this species for three time periods: 2020, 2050 and 2080 in two greenhouse-gas emissions scenarios (A2a and B2a), which assume a medium and a lower increase in CO2 emissions, respectively. Our modeling revealed that: 1) the size of suitable areas for grouse will decline over time, especially in emissions scenario A2a; 2) range shifts will happen at both latitudinal (northward shift) and elevational direction (upward). In addition, habitat expansion will be limited relative to loss, especially in the more distant future. Although the size of suitable area will not change greatly in the near future (e.g. 2020 and 2050), as predicted in the emissions scenario A2a in 2020, habitat will become more fragmented. Therefore, we suggest that the habitat fragmentation be considered with range shifts calculation while assessing the climate change threats. To cope with the ongoing climate change, either the protected area of the existing reserves should be expanded or new reserves should be established to accommodate range shifts. Reforestation and gouse population monitoring should also be conducted in the reserves to track response of grouse to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Aim The spatial resolution of species atlases and therefore resulting model predictions are often too coarse for local applications. Collecting distribution data at a finer resolution for large numbers of species requires a comprehensive sampling effort, making it impractical and expensive. This study outlines the incorporation of existing knowledge into a conventional approach to predict the distribution of Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) at a resolution 100 times finer than available atlas data. Location Malaga province, Andalusia, southern Spain. Methods A Bayesian expert system was proposed to utilize the knowledge from distribution models to yield the probability of a species being recorded at a finer resolution (1×1km) than the original atlas data (10×10km). The recorded probability was then used as a weight vector to generate a sampling scheme from the species atlas to enhance the accuracy of the modelling procedure. The maximum entropy for species distribution modelling (MaxEnt) was used as the species distribution model. A comparison was made between the results of the MaxEnt using the enhanced and, the random sampling scheme, based on four groups of environmental variables: topographic, climatic, biological and anthropogenic. Results The models with the sampling scheme enhanced by an expert system had a higher discriminative capacity than the baseline models. The downscaled (i.e. finer scale) species distribution maps using a hybrid MaxEnt/expert system approach were more specific to the nest locations and were more contrasted than those of the baseline model. Main conclusions The proposed method is a feasible substitute for comprehensive field work. The approach developed in this study is applicable for predicting the distribution of Bonelli's eagle at a local scale from a national-level occurrence data set; however, the usefulness of this approach may be limited to well-known species. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {In recent years, brown bear Ursus arctos populations in Iran have experienced a clear trend of reduction and the species is now officially listed as threatened under provincial legislation. Anthropogenic habitat alteration and increasing human access to previously remote landscapes are potential source of stress for this species in Iran. Therefore, land cover changes in the Chelcheli protected area were mapped for 1991-2013 using time sequential Landsat TM and ETM at 30 meters resolution. Moreover, Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling was used to investigate habitat selection of brown bear. The results showed that suitable patches overlapped with forest areas (Hyrcanian forest) and rivers. Our results also indicate that the brown bear habitat suitability is negatively influenced by human disturbance (e.g., roads, settlements). Increased human disturbance in brown bear habitat in recent decades may cause bears to avoid the disturbed areas. Therefore, the management plans should focus on reducing the human infrastructures around brown bear habitat. A suggestion is to place the core secure areas for brown bear inside the suitable habitat close to rivers where the human access is restricted. Promoting awareness of biodiversity conservation among tourism should also be one of the major focuses of management plans. {\textcopyright} 2016, Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophaga) is the most abundant Antarctic seal and inhabits the circumpolar pack ice zone of the Southern Ocean. Until now, information on important environmental factors affecting its distribution as well as on foraging behaviour is limited. In austral summer 1998, 12 crabeater seals of both sexes and different age classes were equipped with satellite-linked dive recorders at Drescher Inlet (72.85°S, 19.26°E), eastern Weddell Sea. To identify suitable habitat conditions within the Weddell Sea, a maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling approach was implemented. The model revealed that the eastern and southern Weddell Sea is especially suitable for crabeater seals. Distance to the continental shelf break and sea ice concentration were the two most important parameters in modelling species distribution throughout the study period. Model predictions demonstrated that crabeater seals showed a dynamic response to their seasonally changing environment emphasized by the favoured sea ice conditions. Crabeater seals utilized ice-free waters substantially, which is potentially explained by the comparatively low sea ice cover of the Weddell Sea during summer 1998. Diving behaviour was characterized by short ({\textgreater}90 {\%} = 0–4 min) and shallow ({\textgreater}90 {\%} = 0–51 m) dives. This pattern reflects the typical summer and autumn foraging behaviour of crabeater seals. Both the distribution and foraging behaviour corresponded well with the life history of the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), the preferred prey of crabeater seals. In general, predicted suitable habitat conditions were congruent with probable habitats of krill, which emphasizes the strong dependence on their primary prey. {\textcopyright} 2016, The Author(s).},

We compared the performance of range maps and MaxEnt species distribution models at different spatial resolutions by examining the degree of similarity between predicted species richness and composition against observed values from well-surveyed cells (WSCs). Location Mexico. Methods We estimated amphibian richness distributions at five spatial resolutions (from 0.083° to 2°) by overlaying 370 individual range maps or MaxEnt predictions, comparing the similarity of the spatial patterns and correlating predicted values with the observed values for WSCs. Additionally, we looked at species composition and assessed commission and omission errors associated with each method. Results MaxEnt predictions reveal greater geographic differences in richness between species rich and species poor regions than the range maps did at the five resolutions assessed. Correlations between species richness values estimated by either of the two procedures and the observed values from the WSCs increased with decreasing resolution. The slopes of the regressions between the predicted and observed values indicate that MaxEnt overpredicts observed species richness at all of the resolutions used, while range maps underpredict them, except at the finest resolution. Prediction errors did not vary significantly between methods at any resolution and tended to decrease with decreasing resolution. The accuracy of both procedures was clearly different when commission and omission errors were examined separately. Main conclusions Despite the congruent increase in the geographic richness patterns obtained from both procedures as resolution decreases, the maps created with these methods cannot be used interchangeably because of notable differences in the species compositions they report. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim: The distribution of the Lusitanian flora and fauna, species which are found only in southern and western Ireland and in northern Spain and Portugal but which are absent from intervening countries, represents one of the classic conundrums of biogeography. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the distribution of the Lusitanian plant species Daboecia cantabrica was due to persistence in separate Irish and Iberian refugia, or has resulted from post-glacial recolonization followed by subsequent extinction of intervening populations. Location: Northern Spain and Co. Galway, western Ireland. Methods: Palaeodistribution modelling using Maxent was employed to identify putative refugial areas for D. cantabrica at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Phylogeographical analysis of samples from 64 locations in Ireland and Spain were carried out using a chloroplast marker (atpB-rbcL), the nuclear ITS region, and an anonymous nuclear single-copy locus. Results: The palaeodistribution model indicated areas with a high probability of survival for D. cantabrica at the LGM off the western coast of Galicia in Spain, and in the Bay of Biscay. Spanish populations exhibited substantially higher genetic diversity than Irish populations at all three loci, as well as geographical structuring of haplotypes within Spain consistent with divergence in separate refugia. Spanish populations also exhibited far more endemic haplotypes. Divergence time between Irish and Spanish populations associated with the putative Biscay refugium was estimated as 3.333-32 ka. Main conclusions: Our data indicate persistence by D. cantabrica throughout the LGM in two separate southern refugia: one in western Galicia and one in the area off the coast of western France which now lies in the Bay of Biscay. Spain was recolonized from both refugia, whilst Ireland was most likely recolonized from the Biscay refugium. On the balance of evidence across the three marker types and the palaeodistribution modelling, our findings do not support the idea of in situ survival of D. cantabrica in Ireland, contrary to earlier suggestions. The fact that we cannot conclusively rule out the existence of a small, more northerly refugium, however, highlights the need for further analysis of Lusitanian plant species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Conserving and restoring muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) spawning habitat are essential for maintaining self-sustaining populations. A Maxent model was developed based on presence and background data to investigate the relationship between the occurrence of spawning muskellunge and habitat features in the upper Niagara River. Muskellunge spawning points (n=15) were determined by direct observation of spawning pairs. Model inputs were based on micro-habitat features collected at each spawning point and a sample of 250 background habitat points. The full model was reduced to a four variable model to remove uninformative variables and reduce overfitting and redundancy. Model performance was evaluated based on the mean test gain of cross-validated models (n=15). Model outputs identified aquatic macrophyte/algae coverage as the most important habitat feature at spawning locations. The relative probability of muskellunge spawning increased with the percent rank of total aquatic macrophyte/algae coverage, water velocity, and water depth and it was highest at points with muddy-sand to sand substrates. Mean test gain (0.68; SE=0.52) of the cross-validated models indicated that the likelihood of an average muskellunge spawning point was nearly two times greater than an average background point. Results from this research advance our knowledge of muskellunge reproductive ecology, while providing scientists and managers with quantitative measures to guide habitat conservation and restoration. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {1.Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) assess relationships between species distribution data and environmental features, to evaluate the environmental suitability (ES) of a given area for a species, by providing a measure of the probability of presence. If the output of SDMs represents the relationships between habitat features and species performance well, SDM results can be related also to other key parameters of populations, including reproductive parameters. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated whether SDM results can be used as a proxy of reproductive parameters (breeding output, territory size) in red-backed shrikes (Lanius collurio). 2.The distribution of 726 shrike territories in Northern Italy was obtained through multiple focused surveys; for a subset of pairs, we also measured territory area and number of fledged juveniles. We used Maximum Entropy modelling to build a SDM on the basis of territory distribution. We used generalized least squares and spatial generalized mixed models to relate territory size and number of fledged juveniles to SDM suitability, while controlling for spatial autocorrelation. 3.Species distribution models predicted shrike distribution very well. Territory size was negatively related to suitability estimated through SDM, while the number of fledglings significantly increased with the suitability of the territory. This was true also when SDM was built using only spatially and temporally independent data. 4.Results show a clear relationship between ES estimated through presence-only SDMs and two key parameters related to species' reproduction, suggesting that suitability estimated by SDM, and habitat quality determining reproduction parameters in our model system, are correlated. Our study shows the potential use of SDMs to infer important fitness parameters; this information can have great importance in management and conservation. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

Variables representing seafloor structure, generated from airborne bathymetric LiDAR were combined with spatially-explicit fishing event data, to characterize the geographic footprint of the western Victorian abalone fishery, in south-east Australia. A MaxEnt modeling approach determined that bathymetry, rugosity and complexity were the three most important predictors in defining suitable fishing grounds (AUC = 0.89).

Understanding the global potential distribution and ecological characteristics of this species is a prerequisite for its practical exploitation as a resource. Here, a maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) was used to simulate the potential distribution of this species around the world, and the dominant climatic factors affecting its distribution were selected by using a jackknife test and the regularized gain change during each iteration of the training algorithm. The results show that the MaxEnt model performs better than random, with an average test AUC value of 0.9165 (±0.0088). The coldness index, annual mean temperature and warmth index were the most important climatic factors affecting the species distribution, explaining 65.79{\%} of the variability in the geographical distribution. Species response curves showed unimodal relationships with the annual mean temperature and warmth index, whereas there was a linear relationship with the coldness index. The dominant climatic conditions in the core of the black locust distribution are a coldness index of -9.8 °C-0 °C, an annual mean temperature of 5.8 °C-14.5 °C, a warmth index of 66 °C-168 °C and an annual precipitation of 508-1867 mm. The potential distribution of black locust is located mainly in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, Chile and Argentina.

abstract = {Modern biogeographers recognize that humans are seen as constituents of ecosystems, drivers of significant change, and perhaps, the most invasive species on earth. We found it instructive to model humans as invasive organisms with the same environmental factors. We present a preliminary model of the spread of modern humans in the conterminous United States between 1992 and 2001 based on a subset of National Land Cover Data (NLCD), a time series LANDSAT product. We relied on the commonly used Maxent model, a species-environmental matching model, to map urbanization. Results: Urban areas represented 5.1{\%} of the lower 48 states in 2001, an increase of 7.5{\%} (18,112 km2) in the nine year period. At this rate, an area the size of Massachusetts is converted to urban land use every ten years. We used accepted models commonly used for mapping plant and animal distributions and found that climatic and environmental factors can strongly predict our spread (i.e., the conversion of forests, shrub/grass, and wetland areas into urban areas), with a 92.5{\%} success rate (Area Under the Curve). Adding a roads layer in the model improved predictions to a 95.5{\%} success rate. 8.8{\%} of the 1-km2 cells in the conterminous U.S. now have a major road in them. In 2001, 0.8{\%} of 1-km2 cells in the U.S. had an urbanness value of {\textgreater} 800, ({\textgreater}89{\%} of a 1-km2 cell is urban), while we predict that 24.5{\%} of 1-km2 cells in the conterminous U.S. will be {\textgreater} 800 eventually. Main conclusion: Humans have a highly predictable pattern of urbanization based on climatic and topographic variables. Conservation strategies may benefit from that predictability. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

A landscape model was created using maximum entropy distribution modelling (MaxEnt), predicting suitable nesting habitat for Wedge-tailed Eagles by extrapolating fi eld measurements. This study found that during the 2011 breeding season Wedge-tailed Eagles in the ACT showed a preference for northeast facing aspects (P {\textless}0.01). Nests were located midslope, at elevations between 457 and 777 metres on slopes less than 30 degrees. Nests averaged 13 ± 3 metres above the ground (range 5-19 m, n = 34), in trees averaging 18 ± 3 metres tall (rang e 11-26 m, n = 34).

As such, the distribution of most cetacean species is still poorly understood. Ecological niche models are useful in studying species distributions and their ecological determinants, and platforms of opportunity (e.g. commercial nautical operators) can provide an alternative source for that data in cetaceans. In this study, we modelled common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) habitat preferences using ecological niche modelling and presence data obtained from distinct platforms of opportunity in two different areas in the Portuguese coast (west and south mainland Portugal) for the period 2005-2007. Models from southern Portugal were projected to western Portugal and vice-versa, to check for robustness in predicting the species ecological niche. Our results show that data from platforms of opportunity can result in robust ecological models and provide extremely useful information on cetacean ecology. We found that common dolphins exhibit a patchy distribution pattern over the Portuguese coastline, and identified key habitats for their occurrence. The most important variable associated with this species' distribution was chlorophyll concentration which, given the results from previous research, we hypothesise reflects an ecological specialisation on pelagic schooling fish. Given that the most abundant schooling fish species in Portugal is increasingly overexploited and in constant decline, more attention should be given to the conservation of common dolphin in Portuguese waters. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {In the recent history, climatic changes have taken place at a planetary scale and organisms needed to adapt to these changes. The last glaciation is one of most documented climatic events responsible for the current distribution of living organisms. In the last two decades, conservationists have intensively discussed how extant organisms, some of which witnessed the last glaciation, will be able to cope with the new challenge: global warming. In this matter, several recently developed statistical algorithms (e.g., MaxEnt) and GIS techniques have been employed in species distribution modelling and identifying suitable conservation strategies. At the European level, the Natura 2000 network is one of the most extensive conservation strategies currently applied. But is this strategy always efficient? To respond to this main question we selected a typical glacial relict species (Ligularia sibirica (L.) Cass.) that is declining due to anthropogenic activities and which could also be influenced by global warming. We modelled the current and future distribution of the species in Romania using MaxEnt algorithm with bioclimatic data and investigated the efficiency of Natura 2000 in the long-term conservation of the target species. Our results showed that the niche of Ligularia sibirica has been conserved over time and is mostly influenced by cold and wet climate conditions. The projected climatic changes will not affect the future predicted distribution of the species' bioclimatic niche. We conclude that the efficiency of Natura 2000 in Romania for this species is less than optimal. In a broader conservation perspective, we recommend that information provided by species climatic distribution models (both present and future) should be taken into account to improve future protected area networks.},

In this study we investigated how future climatic changes could affect the climatic niche of Ixodes ricinus (Acari, Ixodida), among the most important vectors of pathogens of medical and veterinary concern in Europe. Methods. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) was used to reconstruct the climatic niche of I. ricinus, and to project it into the future conditions for 2050 and 2080, under two scenarios: a continuous human demographic growth and a severe increase of gas emissions (scenario A2), and a scenario that proposes lower human demographic growth than A2, and a more sustainable gas emissions (scenario B2). Models were reconstructed using the algorithm of "maximum entropy", as implemented in the software Maxent 3.3.3e; 4,544 occurrence points and 15 bioclimatic variables were used. Results: In both scenarios an increase of climatic niche of about two times greater than the current area was predicted as well as a higher climatic suitability under the scenario B2 than A2. Such an increase occurred both in a latitudinal and longitudinal way, including northern Eurasian regions (e.g. Sweden and Russia), that were previously unsuitable for the species. Conclusions: Our models are congruent with the predictions of range expansion already observed in I. ricinus at a regional scale and provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the future climatically suitable areas for I. ricinus at a continental scale. Although the use of SDM at a higher resolution should be integrated by a more refined analysis of further abiotic and biotic data, the results presented here suggest that under future climatic scenarios most of the current distribution area of I. ricinus could remain suitable and significantly increase at a continental geographic scale. Therefore disease outbreaks of pathogens transmitted by this tick species could emerge in previous non-endemic geographic areas. Further studies will implement and refine present data toward a better understanding of the risk represented by I. ricinus to human health. {\textcopyright} 2013 Porretta et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite important recent advances in modeling current and future global fire activity in relation to biophysical predictors there remain important uncertainties about finer-scale spatial heterogeneity of fire and especially about human influences which are typically assessed at coarse-spatial resolutions. The purpose of the current study is to quantify the influence of biophysical and anthropogenic variables on the spatial distribution of wildfire activity between 1984 and 2010 over an extensive southern Patagonian-Andean region from ca. 438 to 538 S extending from coastal rainforests to xeric woodland and steppe. We used satellite imagery to map all detectable fires .5 ha from 1984 to 2010 in four study areas (each of 13,100 to 36,635 km2) and field checked 65 of these burns for accuracy of burned vegetation class and fire perimeters. Then, we used the MaxEnt modeling technique to assess the relationships of wildfire distributions to biophysical and human environmental variables in each of the four regions. The 232 fires .5 ha mapped in the four study areas accounted for an area of 1,314 km2 indicating that at least 1.8{\%} of the total area burned between 1984 and 2010. In general, areas with intermediate productivity levels (e.g., shrublands) have higher fire probability compared with areas of low and high productivity levels, such as steppe and wet forests, respectively. There is a marked contrast in the flammability of broad vegetation classes in determining fire activity at a regional scale, as well as a strong spatial relationship of wildfires to anthropogenic variables. The juxtaposition of fire-resistant tall forests with fire-prone shrublands and woodlands creates the potential for positive feedbacks from human-set fires to gradually increase the flammability of extensive landscapes through repeated burning. Distance to roads and settlements were also strong predictors, suggesting that fire in all regions is ignition-limited. However, these anthropogenic predictors influenced probability of fire differently among study regions depending on their main land-use practices and their past and present socioeconomic contexts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Paritsis et al.},

It is rapid in freshwater swamp forest ecosystems, since they support disproportionate levels of biodiversity compared to their spatial coverage. The natural swamp forests of Bangladesh have been especially susceptible to climate change as they are limited in range to a few scattered patches in the north-eastern region. We sought to understand how climate change may impact the swamp forests of Bangladesh by modelling distributional changes in Pongamia pinnata and Barringtonia acutangula species, which dominate or co-dominate most swamp forest ecosystems across Bangladesh. We used the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling tool, combined presence-only data of species and bioclimatic variables for two climate scenarios (RCP6.0 and RCP8.5). We compared current, 2050 and 2070 distributions. Results suggest that plant extractable water holding capacity of soil, annual precipitation, precipitation of warmest quarter and mean annual actual evapotranspiration are the key bioclimatic variables for the distribution of both trees. The MaxEnt models indicate that Pongamia pinnata and Barringtonia acutangula trees of Bangladesh face increasing climate stress and may become extinction under both mid-range and extreme climate scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2016, Society of Wetland Scientists.},

abstract = {Background: Mapping the aboveground biomass of tropical forests is essential both for implementing conservation policy and reducing uncertainties in the global carbon cycle. Two medium resolution (500 m - 1000 m) pantropical maps of vegetation biomass have been recently published, and have been widely used by sub-national and national-level activities in relation to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). Both maps use similar input data layers, and are driven by the same spaceborne LiDAR dataset providing systematic forest height and canopy structure estimates, but use different ground datasets for calibration and different spatial modelling methodologies. Here, we compare these two maps to each other, to the FAO's Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) 2010 country-level data, and to a high resolution (100 m) biomass map generated for a portion of the Colombian Amazon.Results: We find substantial differences between the two maps, in particular in central Amazonia, the Congo basin, the south of Papua New Guinea, the Miombo woodlands of Africa, and the dry forests and savannas of South America. There is little consistency in the direction of the difference. However, when the maps are aggregated to the country or biome scale there is greater agreement, with differences cancelling out to a certain extent. When comparing country level biomass stocks, the two maps agree with each other to a much greater extent than to the FRA 2010 estimates. In the Colombian Amazon, both pantropical maps estimate higher biomass than the independent high resolution map, but show a similar spatial distribution of this biomass.Conclusions: Biomass mapping has progressed enormously over the past decade, to the stage where we can produce globally consistent maps of aboveground biomass. We show that there are still large uncertainties in these maps, in particular in areas with little field data. However, when used at a regional scale, different maps appear to converge, suggesting we can provide reasonable stock estimates when aggregated over large regions. Therefore we believe the largest uncertainties for REDD+ activities relate to the spatial distribution of biomass and to the spatial pattern of forest cover change, rather than to total globally or nationally summed carbon density. {\textcopyright} 2013 Mitchard et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is the world's highest and largest plateau. Due to increasing demands for environment exploration and tourism, a large transitional area is required for altitude adaptation. Hehuang valley, which locates in the transition zone between the Loess Plateau and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, has convenient transportation and relatively low elevation. Our question is whether the geographic conditions here are appropriate for adapted stay before going into the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Therefore, in this study, we examined the potential use of ecological niche modeling (ENM) for mapping current and potential distribution patterns of human settlements. We chose the Maximum Entropy Method (Maxent), an ENM which integrates climate, remote sensing and geographical data, to model distributions and assess land suitability for transition areas. After preprocessing and selection, the correlation between variables and spatial autocorrelation input data were removed and 106 occurrence points and 9 environmental layers were determined as the model inputs. The threshold-independent model performance was reasonable according to 10 times model running, with the area under the curve (AUC) values being 0.917 ± 0.01, and 0.923 ± 0.002 for test data. Cohen's kappa coefficient of model performance was 0.848. Results showed that 82.22{\%} of the study extent was not suitable for human settlement. Of the remaining areas, highly suitable areas accounted for 1.19{\%}, moderately for 5.3{\%} and marginally for 11.28{\%}. These suitable areas totaled 418.79 km2, and 86.25{\%} of the sample data was identified in the different gradient of suitable area. The decisive environmental factors were slope and two climate variables: mean diurnal temperature range and temperature seasonality. Our model showed a good performance in mapping and assessing human settlements. This study provides the first predicted potential habitat distribution map for human settlement in Ledu County, which could also help in land use management. {\textcopyright} 2013 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Amphibians are among the most threatened taxonomic groups worldwide. A fundamental step in species conservation is identifying the habitat requirements of the target species. However, this determination can often be problematic in endangered species because, by definition, they often only occupy a very limited number of sites. Moreover, when found, they are often in low abundance, and thus their detectability is low, yielding false "absence" data. Maximum entropy niche modeling provides a tool using only the presence data to predict potential habitat distributions of endangered species whose distributions have become highly limited. We provide two examples in the current study for the fire salamander, Salamandra infraimmaculata, and the green toad, Bufo viridis. S. infraimmaculata is considered endangered in Israel and near endangered worldwide. B. viridis is classified as locally endangered in Israel. Soil type was the most important predictor of the distribution of S. infraimmaculata and, to a lesser extent, also predicted the distribution of B. viridis. In addition, S. infraimmaculata larvae were also associated with high elevation areas. B. viridis was negatively associated with distance to urban areas and low solar radiation level. The potential distribution maps determined for S. infraimmaculata and B. viridis can help in planning future wetland use management around its existing populations, discovering new populations, identifying top-priority survey sites, or set priorities to restore its natural habitat for more effective conservation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Aim Three-quarters of Octocorallia species are found in deep waters. These cold-water octocoral colonies can form a major constituent of structurally complex habitats. The global distribution and the habitat requirements of deep-sea octocorals are poorly understood given the expense and difficulties of sampling at depth. Habitat suitability models are useful tools to extrapolate distributions and provide an understanding of ecological requirements. Here, we present global habitat suitability models and distribution maps for seven suborders of Octocorallia: Alcyoniina, Calcaxonia, Holaxonia, Scleraxonia, Sessiliflorae, Stolonifera and Subselliflorae. Location Global. Methods We use maximum entropy modelling to predict octocoral distribution using a database of 12,508 geolocated octocoral specimens and 32 environmental grids resampled to 30 arc-second (approximately 1km 2) resolution. Additionally, a meta-analysis determined habitat preferences and niche overlap between the different suborders of octocorals. Results Suborder Sessiliflorae had the widest potential habitat range, but all records for all suborders implied a habitat preference for continental shelves and margins, particularly the North and West Atlantic and Western Pacific Rim. Temperature, salinity, broad scale slope, productivity, oxygen and calcite saturation state were identified as important factors for determining habitat suitability. Less than 3{\%} of octocoral records were found in waters undersaturated for calcite, but this result is affected by a shallow-water sampling bias. Main conclusions The logistical difficulties, expense and vast areas associated with deep-sea sampling leads to a gap in the knowledge of faunal distributions that is difficult to fill without predictive modelling. Global distribution estimates are presented, highlighting many suitable areas which have yet to be studied. We suggest that approximately 17{\%} of oceans are suitable for at least one suborder but 3.5{\%} may be suitable for all seven. This is the first global habitat suitability modelling study on the distribution of octocorals and forms a useful resource for researchers, managers and conservationists. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Question: Given the current state of knowledge on plant species richness in Catalonia, how can we improve definition of sampled species richness patterns? We propose a concrete methodology that will highlight the most speciose areas and those areas that are insufficiently sampled. Location: Catalonia, covering 31 980 km 2 in northeast Spain. Methods: This study provides a quantitative assessment of plant richness using sampling units of 10 km × 10 km (n = 319). Generalized linear models (GLM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and a maximum entropy model (Maxent) were used for all plant species contained in the Catalonia Database of Biodiversity (Banc de Dades de Biodiversitat de Catalunya, BDBC). The projected presence/absence maps were combined to create species richness maps based on distribution models for 2738 species. Results: The modelling techniques were highly correlated, and we did not distinguish any differences in projections of geographic patterns of species richness among the modelling algorithms. However, MARS and Maxent achieved the best prediction success, whereas GLM tended to over-predict species number per quadrat. The MARS map gave the highest predictive performance based on both Kappa and the true skill statistic, and for the two components of disagreement (quantity and allocation disagreement). We were able to identify one previously known region of high diversity, the Pyrenees, and two additional areas, the coastal range and the pre-coastal mountain range. Conclusions: We obtain improved distribution patterns for plant species in Catalonia over the previously sampled patterns, and, most importantly, we provide an estimate of the number of species present in those areas where sampling data are incomplete, with an expected 300 species. The model-predicted richness maps presented here can be used to detect zones with low and high species richness and to develop strategies for either restoring or protecting landscape biodiversity as part of national conservation plans. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

In this study, we predict the potential distribution of 61 species of African estrildid finches in order to assess current and past diversity patterns. Models were projected onto two climatic scenarios (Community Climate System Model, CCSM, and Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, MIROC) representing past climate conditions, as might be expected during the Last Glacial Maximum 21 000 years BP. Subsequent overlays of the resulting potential distributions were conducted under different dispersal assumptions and compared with expert maps. Our results suggest highly similar current distribution patterns obtained by both methods. Projections onto Pleistocene scenarios showed similar patterns, with only small differences under limited and unlimited dispersal assumptions. Looking separately at diversity patterns predicted for forest and savannah species, diversity hot spots of forest species under MIROC conditions were consistent with suggested forest refugia, but were inconsistent under CCSM conditions. According to our models, savannah species were more widely distributed during the cooler and drier conditions of the Pleistocene. By using ecological niche models we show that current diversity patterns of a whole species group may have changed only slightly since the Pleistocene, suggesting a pattern of general spatial stability. However, we emphasize the importance of using different climatic scenarios as well as including the supposed dispersal of organisms in the modelling, as these factors influence results on a broad scale. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract = {Building monuments was one way that past societies reconfigured their landscapes in response to shifting social and ecological factors. Understanding the connections between those factors and monument construction is critical, especially when multiple types of monuments were constructed across the same landscape. Geospatial technologies enable past cultural activities and environmental variables to be examined together at large scales. Many geospatial modeling approaches, however, are not designed for presence-only (occurrence) data, which can be limiting given that many archaeological site records are presence only. We use maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt), which works with presence-only data, to predict the distribution of monuments across large landscapes, and we analyze MaxEnt output to quantify the contributions of spatioenvironmental variables to predicted distributions. We apply our approach to co-occurring Late Precontact (ca. A.D. 1000-1600) monuments in Michigan: (i) mounds and (ii) earthwork enclosures. Many of these features have been destroyed by modern development, and therefore, we conducted archival research to develop our monument occurrence database. We modeled each monument type separately using the same input variables. Analyzing variable contribution to MaxEnt output, we show that mound and enclosure landscape suitability was driven by contrasting variables. Proximity to inland lakes was key to mound placement, and proximity to rivers was key to sacred enclosures. This juxtaposition suggests that mounds met local needs for resource procurement success, whereas enclosures filled broader regional needs for intergroup exchange and shared ritual. Our study shows how MaxEnt can be used to develop sophisticated models of past cultural processes, including monument building, with imperfect, limited, presence-only data.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) have become a standard tool in ecology and applied conservation biology. Modelling rare and threatened species is particularly important for conservation purposes. However, modelling rare species is difficult because the combination of few occurrences and many predictor variables easily leads to model overfitting. A new strategy using ensembles of small models was recently developed in an attempt to overcome this limitation of rare species modelling and has been tested successfully for only a single species so far. Here, we aim to test the approach more comprehensively on a large number of species including a transferability assessment. For each species, numerous small (here bivariate) models were calibrated, evaluated and averaged to an ensemble weighted by AUC scores. These 'ensembles of small models' (ESMs) were compared to standard SDMs using three commonly used modelling techniques (GLM, GBM and Maxent) and their ensemble prediction. We tested 107 rare and under-sampled plant species of conservation concern in Switzerland. We show that ESMs performed significantly better than standard SDMs. The rarer the species, the more pronounced the effects were. ESMs were also superior to standard SDMs and their ensemble when they were evaluated using a transferability assessment. By averaging simple small models to an ensemble, ESMs avoid overfitting without losing explanatory power through reducing the number of predictor variables. They further improve the reliability of species distribution models, especially for rare species, and thus help to overcome limitations of modelling rare species. {\textcopyright} 2015 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Thibaud et al. (Methods in Ecology and Evolution 2014) present a framework for simulating species and evaluating the relative effects of factors affecting the predictions from species distribution models (SDMs). They demonstrate their approach by generating presence-absence data sets for different simulated species and analysing them using four modelling methods: three presence-absence methods and Maxent, which is a presence-background modelling tool. One of their results is striking: that their use of Maxent performs well in estimating occupancy probabilities and even outperforms the other methods on small sample sizes. This result is of concern to us, because it suggests that Maxent directly offers a useful alternative for modelling presence-absence data, which may prompt widespread adoption of this use of Maxent. In this paper, we explore why this would be a mistake. We draw on the theory underlying how the Maxent model operates and on simulations to discover: (i) why Maxent appears to fare as well as it does in their evaluation and (ii) why the best-suited presence-absence method for data analysis (the generating model; a GLM) does not perform as well as we would expect. We demonstrate that (i) the good performance observed for Maxent is largely a coincidence; the simulated species match well the arbitrary default parameter that Maxent applies to map its relative output into a 0-1 scale, but errors are much larger for other species we simulate; (ii) the performance of the GLM is poorer than expected because Thibaud et al. do not use model selection and fit a model that is too complex for the amount of data available. Maxent is a presence-background method and only provides estimates of relative suitability regardless of how the background sample is specified. When presence-absence data are available, one can transform Maxent's relative estimates into estimates of occupancy probability, and we provide methods to do so. However, this requires the user to post-process Maxent's output. Proper PA methods such as GLMs can perform well under small sample sizes, provided care is taken during modelling to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate an effective method using regularisation with the R package glmnet. {\textcopyright} 2014 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Species distribution models need adequate sets of data, particularly in the case of range-restricted species. The problem faced in the modeling of rare species is twofold: a small sample size and the occurrence of sampling biases. The present analysis combines spatial- and habitat-thinning approaches to improve maximum entropy models based on geographically incomplete data of relict and subendemic Festuca amethystina L. grass on Polish territory. The results show that models based on strongly incomplete historic data did not predict the occurrence of all important areas where the species was found in the following decades. However, the introduction of species-specific thinning allows for more precise prediction of the species range, i.e., the detection of suitable areas on a more local scale. The introduction of habitat thinning caused the diversity of important predictors in model to increase, but spatial thinning decreased the number of significant predictors and made interpretation easier. Additionally, a combination of thinning techniques allowed significant improvements to be made to the model predictions after the experimental addition of a lower number of localities to regions which had previously been poorly recognized. It can be concluded that in the case of incomplete data, the above corrections allow the true range of the species to be predicted after the discovery of a lower number and relatively dispersed new localities. {\textcopyright}2017.

abstract = {Invasive species can increase the susceptibility of ecosystems to disease by acting as reservoir hosts for pathogens. Invasive hosts are often sparsely recorded and not in equilibrium, so predicting their spatial distributions and overlap with other hosts is problematic. We applied newly developed methods for modelling the distribution of invasive species to the invasive shrub Rhododendron ponticum-a foliar reservoir host for the Phytophthora oomycete plant pathogens, P. ramorum and P. kernoviae, that threaten woodland and heathland habitat in Scotland. We compiled eleven datasets of biological records for R. ponticum (1,691 points, 8,455 polygons) and developed Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models incorporating landscape, soil and climate predictors. Our models produced accurate predictions of current suitable R. ponticum habitat (training AUC = 0. 838; test AUC = 0. 838) that corresponded well with population performance (areal cover). Continuous broad-leaved woodland cover, low elevation ({\textless}400 m a. s. l.) and intermediate levels of soil moisture (or Enhanced Vegetation Index) favoured presence of R. ponticum. The high coincidence of suitable habitat with both core native woodlands (54 {\%} of woodlands) and plantations of another sporulation host, Larix kaempferi (64 {\%} of plantations) suggests a high potential for spread of Phytophthora infection to woodland mediated by R. ponticum. Incorporating non-equilibrium modelling methods did not improve habitat suitability predictions of this invasive host, possibly because, as a long-standing invader, R. ponticum has filled more of its available habitat at this national scale than previously suspected. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

For this purpose, species distribution modelling has been suggested as an effective tool to assess the potential geographic distributions of species under different climate scenarios.Aims: The aim of this study was to generate suitability maps and predictive maps based on scenarios of climate change to identify areas with the most value for conservation for the western Iberian endemics Silene acutifolia, S. foetida subsp. foetida and S. foetida subsp. gayana.Methods: Maxent software was used to model and predict the distribution of the species based on environmental variables under climate change scenarios.Results: Our analysis indicated that the models performed well, predicting with high accuracy the current distributions of the species. Under two scenarios of increasing CO2, the species were predicted to be susceptible to a major reduction of suitable habitat; both S. foetida subspecies were shown to be at risk of extinction.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the inclusion of S. foetida in national conservation and long-term monitoring programmes must be considered. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright 2012 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Scant scientific attention has been given to the abundance and distribution of marine biota in the face of the lower sea level, and steeper latitudinal gradient in climate, during the ice-age conditions that have dominated the past million years. Here we examine the glacial persistence of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) populations using two ecological-niche-models (ENM) and the first broad synthesis of multi-locus gene sequence data for this species. One ENM uses a maximum entropy approach (Maxent); the other is a new ENM for Atlantic cod, using ecophysiological parameters based on observed reproductive events rather than adult distribution. Both the ENMs were tested for present-day conditions, then used to hindcast ranges at the last glacial maximum (LGM) ca 21kyr ago, employing climate model data. Although the LGM range of Atlantic cod was much smaller, and fragmented, both the ENMs agreed that populations should have been able to persist in suitable habitat on both sides of the Atlantic. The genetic results showed a degree of trans-Atlantic divergence consistent with genealogically continuous populations on both sides of the North Atlantic since long before the LGM, confirming the ENM results. In contrast, both the ENMs and the genetic data suggest that the Greenland G. morhua population post-dates the LGM. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

We argue that while the low predictability of vegetation plot data by the gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) models may average out at very large scales and thus be useful in that context, errors at the site-specific scale may confound the modeling used to develop critical habitat designations. We further found that GNN errors violate statistical assumptions and are not propagated through the modeling exercise. We found multiple lines of evidence for habitat model instability, which may result from GNN uncertainty. We believe our evidence for lack of demographic predictability from the MaxEnt RHS values remains relevant to judicious use of these models for conservation.

With global climate change, the spatial pattern of invasive species will also change. Two American states, Arizona and New Mexico, which were affected by southern pine beetle (SPB) (Dendroctonus frontalis), were chosen as the case study area. Environmental variables were extracted from the Daymet datasets, and the ecological niche modeling method of maximum entropy method (Maxent) was introduced to predict potential habitat for the invasive species, together with the generation of distribution maps under three climate change scenarios in 2000, 2050 and 2100 using the same model. Results showed that temperature seasonality and precipitation amount in the wettest quarter were the two most important environmental variables affecting the potential habitat of the invasive pest, contributing 46.7{\%} and 32.4{\%}, respectively. With the increase of temperature, suitability probability of SPB would decrease from 0.0677 to 0.0640 and the infected area would shrink from 1.2{\%} to 0.5{\%} (P {\textgreater} 0.5), contrasting with the increase of suitability probability in infected area from 0.548 9 to 0.6107. With the increase in annual temperature, the potential distribution of SPB would also shift from central Arizona to the southeast part of New Mexico, coinciding with the change of precipitation center from west to east in the wettest quarter.},

abstract = {Wind farms are steadily growing across Europe, with potentially detrimental effects on wildlife. Indeed, cumulative impacts in addition to local effects should be considered when planning wind farm development at a regional scale, and mapping the potential risk to bats at this scale would help in the large-scale planning of wind turbines and focus field surveys on vulnerable areas. Although modelling offers a powerful approach to tackle this goal, its application has been thus far neglected. We developed a simple regional-scale analysis in an area of central Italy (Molise region) that is undergoing considerable wind farm development. We implemented species distribution models (SDMs) for two bat species vulnerable to wind farm impact, Nyctalus leisleri and Pipistrellus pipistrellus. We developed risk maps by overlaying SDMs for the two species with turbine locations, assessed the alteration of the landscape patterns of foraging habitat patches determined by the wind turbines, and identified highly vulnerable areas where wind farm construction would be particularly risky. SDMs were statistically robust (AUC ≥0.8 for both species) and revealed that 41 {\%} of the region offers suitable foraging habitat for both species. These areas host over 50 {\%} of the existing or planned wind farms, with 21 {\%} of the turbines located within 150 m of forest edges, suggesting an increase in fatality risk. The alterations in suitable foraging patches consisted of a 7.7 {\%} increase in the number of patches, a 10.7 {\%} increase in the shape index, and a 8.1 {\%} decrease in the mean patch area. The region's western portion, which is most suitable to both species, requires careful consideration with regard to future wind farm planning. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Recently, the bag-of-words approach has been successfully applied to automatic image annotation, object recognition, etc. The method needs to first quantize an image using the visual terms and then extract the image-level statistics for classification. Although successful applications have been reported, it lacks the capability to model the spatial dependency and the correspondence between the patches and visual parts. Moreover, quantization deteriorates the descriptive power of patch feature. This paper proposes the hidden maximum entropy (HME) approach for modeling visual concepts. Each concept is composed of a set of visual parts, each part having a Gaussian distribution. The spatial dependency and image-level statistics of parts are modeled through the maximum entropy. The model is learned using the developed EM-IIS algorithm. We report the preliminary results on the 260 concepts in the Corel dataset and compared with the maximum entropy (ME) approach. Our experiments on concept detection show that (1) a relative increment of 10.3{\%} is observed when comparing the average AUC value of HME approach with that of the ME approach and (2) the HME approach reduces the average equal error rate from 0.412for the ME approach to 0.354. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

Recent theories state that such structures are bound to low-productivity environments and result from a self-organization process. Our objective was to test this relationship between periodic pattern occurrence and environmental factors at a global scale and to parametrize a predictive distribution model. Location: Arid and semi-arid areas world-wide. Methods: We trained an empirical predictive model (Maxent) for the occurrence of periodic vegetation patterns, based on environmental predictors and known occurrences verified on Landsat satellite images. Results: This model allowed us to discover previously unreported pattern locations, and to report the first ever examples of spotted patterns in natural systems. Relationships to the main environmental drivers are discussed. Main conclusions: These results confirm that periodic patterned vegetations are ubiquitous at the interface between arid and semi-arid regions. Self-organized patterning appears therefore to be a biome-scale response to environmental conditions, including soil and topography. The set of correlations between vegetation patterns and their environmental conditions presented in this study will need to be reproduced in future modelling attempts. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract = {Aim Environmental niche models that utilize presence-only data have been increasingly employed to model species distributions and test ecological and evolutionary predictions. The ideal method for evaluating the accuracy of a niche model is to train a model with one dataset and then test model predictions against an independent dataset. However, a truly independent dataset is often not available, and instead random subsets of the total data are used for 'training' and 'testing' purposes. The goal of this study was to determine how spatially autocorrelated sampling affects measures of niche model accuracy when using subsets of a larger dataset for accuracy evaluation. Location The distribution of Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed; Asteraceae) was modelled in six states in the western United States: California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. Methods Two types of niche modelling algorithms - the genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction (GARP) and maximum entropy modelling (as implemented with Maxent) - were used to model the potential distribution of C. maculosa across the region. The effect of spatially autocorrelated sampling was examined by applying a spatial filter to the presence-only data (to reduce autocorrelation) and then comparing predictions made using the spatial filter with those using a random subset of the data, equal in sample size to the filtered data. Results The accuracy of predictions from both algorithms was sensitive to the spatial autocorrelation of sampling effort in the occurrence data. Spatial filtering led to lower values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve plot but higher similarity statistic (I) values when compared with predictions from models built with random subsets of the total data, meaning that spatial autocorrelation of sampling effort between training and test data led to inflated measures of accuracy. Main conclusions The findings indicate that care should be taken when interpreting the results from presence-only niche models when training and test data have been randomly partitioned but occurrence data were non-randomly sampled (in a spatially autocorrelated manner). The higher accuracies obtained without the spatial filter are a result of spatial autocorrelation of sampling effort between training and test data inflating measures of prediction accuracy. If independently surveyed data for testing predictions are unavailable, then it may be necessary to explicitly account for the spatial autocorrelation of sampling effort between randomly partitioned training and test subsets when evaluating niche model predictions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

A recurring theme is that of reduced dimensionality experiments, in which time evolutions in the indirect dimensions are incremented together, rather than independently. Spectral analysis of such data is carried out using methods such as filtered back-projection, GFT, or parametric signal modeling. By using Maximum Entropy reconstruction of reduced-dimensionality data, we show that the artifacts that arise in reduced dimensionality experiments are intrinsic to the data sampling, and are not, in general, the result of the methods used to compute spectra. Our results illustrate that reduced dimensionality is a special case of non-uniform sampling in the time domain. We show that MaxEnt reconstruction yields more accurate spectra for reduced dimensionality data than back-projection reconstruction and that randomly choosing time increments based on an exponentially weighted distribution is more efficient, with fewer artifacts, than the systematic coupling of time increments used in most reduced dimensionality approaches. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {With an increase in the rate of species extinction, we should choose right methods that are sustainable on the basis of appropriate science and human needs to conserve ecosystems and rare species. Species distribution modeling (SDM) uses 3S technology and statistics and becomes increasingly important in ecology. Brainea insignis (cycad-fern, CF) has been categorized a rare, endangered plant species, and thus was chosen as a target for the study. Five sampling schemes were created with different combinations of CF samples collected from three sites in Huisun forest station and one site, 10 km farther north from Huisun. Four models, MAXENT, GARP, generalized linear models (GLM), and discriminant analysis (DA), were developed based on topographic variables, and were evaluated by five sampling schemes. The accuracy of MAXENT was the highest, followed by GLM and GARP, and DA was the lowest. More importantly, they can identify the potential habitat less than 10{\%} of the study area in the first round of SDM, thereby prioritizing either the field-survey area where microclimatic, edaphic or biotic data can be collected for refining predictions of potential habitat in the later rounds of SDM or search areas for new population discovery. However, it was shown unlikely to extend spatial patterns of CFs from one area to another with a big separation or to a larger area by predictive models merely based on topographic variables. Follow-up studies will attempt to incorporate proxy indicators that can be extracted from hyperspectral images or LIDAR DEM and substitute for direct parameters to make predictive models applicable on a broader scale.},

abstract = {Presence data for four mammals in the Turan Biosphere Reserve in Iran including the Asiatic cheetah ( Acinonyx jubatus venaticus), the Persian onager ( Equus hemionus onager), the wild sheep ( Ovis vignei), and the gazelle ( Gazelle Bennettii) were used to analyze and model their potential interaction, facilitation, habitat coverage and niche dimensions. A geostatistical approach using the spatial autocorrelation between the locality points, and their relationship with habitat resources and characteristics with application of remotely sensed maximum enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and surface temperature, elevation, aspect, vegetation cover and soil moisture was used to predict herbivores species niche. The potential suitable habitat of herbivores along with environmental variables was used to model the predator species (cheetah) niche. The model results were tested using fivefold cross validation by area under the curve (AUC) values on set of independent testing data and were compared to more commonly used models of generalized linear model (GLM) and MaxEnt. The results show that cheetah's potential suitable habitat has 61{\%} overlap with wild sheep, 36{\%} with onager, and 30{\%} with gazelle. Onager habitat has 64{\%} overlap with gazelle and 60{\%} the wild sheep. Wild sheep on the hand, shares only 37{\%} of its habitat with gazelle. The most prey and predator interaction exists between cheetahs and wild sheep, while onagers provides facilitation for gazelles and wild sheep by potentially providing extra water sources. Among the implemented modeling techniques, spatial GLM showed better performance over GLM and MaxEnt. We suggest that conservation effort should focus more on maintaining the population of wild sheep and onagers to support other species in the habitat. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {How complex does a model need to be to provide useful predictions is a matter of continuous debate across environmental sciences. In the species distributions modelling literature, studies have demonstrated that more complex models tend to provide better fits. However, studies have also shown that predictive performance does not always increase with complexity. Testing of species distributions models is challenging because independent data for testing are often lacking, but a more general problem is that model complexity has never been formally described in such studies. Here, we systematically examine predictive performance of models against data and models of varying complexity. We introduce the concept of computational complexity, widely used in theoretical computer sciences, to quantify model complexity. In addition, complexity of species distributional data is characterized by their geometrical properties. Tests involved analysis of models' ability to predict virtual species distributions in the same region and the same time as used for training the models, and to project distributions in different times under climate change. Of the eight species distribution models analyzed five (Random Forest, boosted regression trees, generalized additive models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, MaxEnt) showed similar performance despite differences in computational complexity. The ability of models to forecast distributions under climate change was also not affected by model complexity. In contrast, geometrical characteristics of the data were related to model performance in several ways: complex datasets were consistently more difficult to model, and the complexity of the data was affected by the choice of predictors and the type of data analyzed. Given our definition of complexity, our study contradicts the widely held view that the complexity of species distributions models has significant effects in their predictive ability while findings support for previous observations that the properties of species distributions data and their relationship with the environment are strong predictors of model success. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Information on the spatial distribution of fire danger is needed to improve local fire prevention actions. The Maxent (Maximun Entropy Models), which is prevalent in modeling habitat distribution, was used to predict the possibility of lightning fire occurrence in a 1 × 1 km grid based on history fire data and environment variables in Daxinganling Mountains during the period 2005-2010.We used a jack-knife test to assess the independent contributions of lightning characteristics, meteorological factors, topography and vegetation to the goodness-of-fit of models and evaluated the prediction accuracy with the kappa statistic and AUC (receiver operating characteristic curve) analysis. The results showed that rainfall, number of strikes and lightning current intensity were major factors, and vegetation and geographic variable were secondary, in affecting lightning fire occurrence. The predicted model performs well in terms of accuracy, with an average AUC and maximum kappa value of 0.866 and 0.782, respectively, for the validation sample. The prediction accuracy also increased with the sample size. Our study demonstrated that the Maxent model can be used to predict lightning fire occurrence in the Daxinganling Mountains. This model can provide guidance to forest managers in spatial assessment of daily fire danger. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

This study tests the use of ecosystem functioning variables, derived from satellite imagery data, to explore their potential use in modeling the distribution of the European badger in Mediterranean arid environments. We found that the performance of distribution models was enhanced by the inclusion of variables derived from the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), such as mean EVI (a proxy for primary production), the coefficient of variation of mean EVI (an indicator of seasonality), and the standard deviation of mean EVI (representing spatial heterogeneity of primary production). We also found that distributions predicted by remote sensing data were consistent with the ecological preferences of badger in those environments, which may be explained by the link between EVI-derived variables and the spatial and temporal variability of food resource availability. In conclusion, we suggest the incorporation of variables associated with ecosystem function into species modeling exercises as a useful tool for improving decision-making related to wildlife conservation and management. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Establishing protected area networks is a key strategy to reduce biodiversity loss and contributes to global conservation efforts. In the Philippines, where 240 protected areas have been designated and set aside for the conservation of biological diversity, approaches are needed to effectively conserve and manage these areas. Identifying High Conservation Value Areas (HCVA) is a practical approach to guide protected area managers for prioritising conservation action and monitoring conservation success. We applied the approach in seven sites (c. 555,000 ha) representing three major biogeographic regions of the Philippines National Integrated Protected Areas System. Using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm, we modeled species distributions from environmental predictors (e.g., topographic, bioclimatic, land cover, forest structure, and soil image layers) derived from remotely sensed data, and point occurrence data of species (comprised of birds, trees, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles) observed during field surveys in the selected protected areas. Species distributions from a total of 109 trigger species were modeled, and final species that fit the criteria were stacked to generate species richness maps for identifying HCVAs. Forest habitat change was delineated using official 2003 and 2010 national land cover maps that were generated from Landsat imagery. Results showed park boundaries that were inconsistent with areas of high species congruence. Forest habitat loss (c. 30,100 ha) was observed in all seven protected areas, mainly along forest edges and encroaching within park boundaries. Spatial analysis highlighted conservation hotspots where forest habitat loss threatened highly species-rich areas. The HCVA approach provided spatially explicit inputs for reformulating protected area management zones, setting measureable conservation targets, designing monitoring protocols, and establishing patrolling routes.},

abstract = {Climate and land-use changes are expected to cause many species to shift into or beyond the boundaries of protected areas, leading to large turnover in species composition. Here, we tested whether long-established protected areas in Canada were more robust to such climate change impacts than areas with no formal protection by measuring changes in modeled butterfly species distributions (n = 139) within them. We used a recently established distribution modeling technique, Maxent, to model butterfly species' distributions in two epochs (1900-1930 and 1960-1990). We compared rates of butterfly species richness and composition change within protected areas against distributions of randomly selected, ecologically similar, but non-protected, areas. Change in species richness and composition within protected areas were, for the most part, the same as changes observed among random areas outside protected area boundaries. These results suggest that existing protected area networks in Canada have provided little buffer against the impacts of climate change on butterfly species richness, possibly because land-use change surrounding long-standing protected areas has not been substantial enough to elevate the habitat protection afforded by these protected areas relative to other areas. Although protected areas are unarguably beneficial in conserving biological diversity, their capacity to maintain habitat appears insufficient to prevent broader-scale climate changes from sweeping species beyond their boundaries. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Since then, the species is spreading throughout the continent, with several economic and ecological negative consequences. Aim: To model, in the headwaters of Parana River, the spatial distribution ofL. fortunei and to understand the determinants of the current pattern of species distribution and the risk of invasion of areas not yet colonized. Methods: The ecological niche of L. fortunei was modeled using the algorithm MAXENT (Maximum Entropy Method) combined with records of occurrence of the bivalve, limnological data and the shear force measured by the index Hack (SL). The evaluation of the performance of different models was based on AUC (Area Under the Curve).The analysis of each variable's contribution to the responses of the models was made based on the Jackknife test, available in the Maxent program. The models were validated with real absence data collected between 2006 and 2007. Based on the limnological characterization of the area and on outputs of the models, this analysis sought to understand the contributing aspects to the current and potential spatial distribution and to verify the risk of invasion of environments not yet colonized by the species. Results/Conclusion: The limnological characterization showed that the ecological requirements for the species as, pH, calcium, oxygen and chlorophyll a, were appropriate in both the connected stretches, invaded and non-invaded. Turbidity showed significant spatial differences which proved to be higher in environments with higher levels of Hack (SL), i.e. higher energy fluvial. In addition, the algorithm showed the importance of hydrodynamical aspects expressed by Hack index (SL) to the spatial distribution of species, since the models with the best performances were those that considered the Hack index (SL) as one of the environmental layers of the mussel's niche.

abstract = {Context: Understanding and predicting the spatial patterns of species abundance is a critical need in macroecology. But, widespread abundance data are rare, and habitat models based on species occurrences are typically poor predictors of abundance. Objectives: I ask whether presence-only species distribution models based on locations of high species abundance can more effectively predict abundance than models based on occurrences. Methods: I created climatic suitability models for fifteen problematic, non-native, invasive plants in the continental US using each of three datasets (1) occurrence data derived from herbarium records, (2) occurrence data derived from regional expert knowledge surveys, and (3) locations of high invasive plant abundance derived from regional expert knowledge surveys. Results: Models based on occurrences from regional surveys were most effective for distinguishing presence from absence. Models based on locations of high abundance were most effective for characterizing both intermediate and high ranks of abundance. Occurrence data from herbarium records were poor predictors of both presence and abundance. Conclusions: This analysis suggests that climate suitable for abundant populations is predictable with species distribution modeling, but not using distribution data alone. High probability of species occurrence does not equal high probability of species abundance, suggesting environmental factors differentially influence abundance and distribution. This difference highlights the need for a macrosystems approach to regional habitat modeling to consider how local-scale processes (e.g., biotic interactions) affect regional patterns. Moreover, as abundance is critical for understanding species roles and impacts on ecosystems, large-scale surveys of quantitative or qualitative species abundance are strongly needed. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Aim: Ecological niche theory states that realized niche breadth should increase with population growth. This relationship has been studied extensively in the context of density-dependent habitat selection, and there is evidence that animal populations at higher density occupy a wider range of vegetation types. To our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the relationship between population growth and climate niche breadth (i.e. the range of climatic conditions occupied). Here we aim to estimate the influence of population trend, as well as changes in distribution, on realized climate niche breadth. Location: North America. Methods: We estimated changes in realized climate niche breadth and distribution between 1980 and 2012 for 46 bird species using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and standard ecological niche modelling techniques. We analysed changes in niche breadth in relation to population trends and distributional changes from the BBS for these same species. Results: Changes in realized climate niche breadth were significantly and positively associated with population growth, as reflected by BBS population trends, and with changes in distributional extent. Using variance partitioning, we showed that 44.2{\%} of the variation in change in niche breadth can be explained by population trend, and that roughly half of this was independent of changes in distribution. Conclusions: Realized climate niche breadth is variable on an ecological time-scale as a function of population trend. Mechanisms associated with changes in distribution and those acting within current species range limits appear to be equally important in driving this relationship. Observed changes in niche breadth may violate distribution modelling assumptions of niche conservatism. Studying how population growth influences realized climate niche breadth is therefore important for understanding dynamic species distributions, responses to climate change and our ability to model future species distributions. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

The aim of this study is to identify the potential suitable habitat for 17 Italian endemic species of flea beetles (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae) by assessing which environmental factors are mostly responsible for current distributions. Potential species distributions were reconstructed by using Maxent application with nineteen bioclimatic variables and three topographic factors. We evaluated the model accuracy by AUC values based on test data, training data and total records, highlighting the high power of Maxent to create potential habitat distribution. Presence records were used to build the final habitat map to obtain the best estimate of the species distribution. To distinguish unsuitable from suitable areas, a reclassification of the probability maps was performed using a 10th percentile training presence logistic threshold. The results of our analysis indicate that species occurrences are significantly associated with bioclimatic factors mainly characterized by annual trend, such as "temperature seasonality" (BIO4) and "precipitation seasonality" (BIO15), and to a lesser extent by variables with quarterly intervals, such as the "mean temperature of driest quarter" (BIO9). Furthermore we performed a cluster analysis finding significant correlation between the distribution of the species considered in the Maxent models and the bioclimatic and topographic variables used for the predictions. Potential suitability distribution modeling of endemic flea beetle species is an appropriate method to identify particular environmental situations that require maximum attention both for the conservation of particular species and the protection of their habitat. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier GmbH.},

Perrier) to climate change and the effectiveness of the protected area network (PAN) for the future conservation of these species. To estimate the environmental niche of the species, we used an original data-set based on satellite image analysis to detect species presence and an ensemble modelling approach using three species distribution models (GLM, GAM and MaxEnt). We projected the species distribution in 2050 and 2080 using an ensemble forecasting approach combining the three species distribution models and three global circulation models for climate projections. Measures of connectivity were employed to assess the present and future effectiveness of the existing PAN. Among the three baobab species studied, two are severely threatened by climate change (A. perrieri and A. suarezensis), in part because the present PAN does not overlap with future species distribution areas. Recently, strong efforts have been made in designing an optimised PAN to conserve Madagascar outstanding biodiversity. Nevertheless, its future effectiveness is questioned by the potential shifts in species distributions due to predicted changes in climate. In the context of climate change, alternative strategies such as ecological restoration would also have to be adopted to conserve biodiversity in Madagascar. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Existing niche model predictions are of limited utility because they are restricted to the US, were constructed in the absence of higher latitude records in Canada, and did not consider potentially important soil-related predictors. Here, we address these gaps, and include more than 1400 new occurrence records for Canada, most of which were collected using Google Street View.

abstract = {This work is concerned with the construction of stochastic models for random elasticity matrices, allowing either for the generation of elasticity tensors exhibiting some material symmetry properties almost surely (integrating the statistical dependence between the random stiffness components) or for the modeling of random media that requires the mean of a stochastic anisotropy measure to be controlled apart from the level of statistical fluctuations. To this aim, we first introduced a decomposition of the stochastic elasticity tensor on a deterministic tensor basis and considered the probabilistic modeling of the random components, having recourse to the MaxEnt principle. Strategies for random generation and estimation were further reviewed, and the approach was exemplified in the case of a material that was transversely isotropic almost surely. In a second stage, we made use of such derivations to propose a generalized model for random elasticity matrices that took into account, almost separately, constraints on both the level of stochastic anisotropy and the level of statistical fluctuations. An example was finally provided and showed the efficiency of the approach. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {In a world with poor biological inventorying and rapid land-use change, predicting the spatial distribution of species is fundamental for the effective management and conservation of threatened taxa. However, on a regional scale, predicting the distribution of rare terrestrial mammals is often unreliable and/or impractical, especially in tropical forests. We apply a recently developed analytic process that integrates density estimation (kernel smoothing), niche-analysis and geostatistics (regression-kriging) to model the occupancy and density distribution of a threatened population of white-lipped peccaries Tayassu pecari in a Brazilian Atlantic forest. Locations (n=45) within a protected area of the Serra-do-Mar state park were obtained from diurnal line transect census (233km), camera-trapping (751 camera-trap days) and surveys ({\textgreater}626km) conducted by park rangers. Niche modelling (environmental niche-factor analysis and MAXENT) revealed a restricted niche compared with the available habitat as defined by seven environmental variables. From the occupancy model obtained from regression-kriging, we found that 72{\%} of a 170km2 protected area is likely to be used by peccaries. We demonstrate that the distribution of large mammals can be restricted within continuous areas of Atlantic forest and therefore population estimates based on the size of protected areas can be overestimated. Our findings suggest that the generation of realized density distributions should become the norm rather than the exception to enable conservation managers and researchers to extrapolate abundance and density estimates across continuous habitats and protected areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Ecological niche modeling (ENM) has become an important tool in conservation biology. Despite its recent success, several basic issues related to algorithm performance are still being debated. We assess the ability of two of the most popular algorithms, GARP and Maxent, to predict distributions when sampling is geographically biased. We use an extensive data set collected in the Brazilian Cerrado, a biodiversity hotspot in South America. We found that both algorithms give richness predictions that are very similar to other traditionally used richness estimators. Also, both algorithms correctly predicted the presence of most species collected during fieldwork, and failed to predict species collected only in very few cases (usually species with very few known localities, i.e., {\textless}5). We also found that Maxent tends to be more sensitive to sampling bias than GARP. However, Maxent performs better when sampling is poor (e.g., low number of data points). Our results indicates that ENM, even when provided with limited and geographically biased localities, is a very useful technique to estimate richness and composition of unsampled areas. We conclude that data generated by ENM maximize the utility of existing biodiversity data, providing a very useful first evaluation. However, for reliable conservation decisions ENM data must be followed by well-designed field inventories, especially for the detection of restricted range, rare species. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

We developed a Maxent model for the rare cerambycid beetle Rosalia longicorn Rosalia alpina L. in Italy and neighbouring regions and identified the variables best explaining the species' occurrence on a large scale. Once successfully validated, we used the model to (a) evaluate the current degree of fragmentation of R. alpina range in Italy; and (b) quantify the amount of the Italian territory with the highest probability of beetle presence within the existing national conservation areas (Natura 2000 network, parks and reserves). Low ({\textless}0.5) probability scores of R. alpina presence corresponded to 89{\%} of the total area considered, whereas high scores ({\textgreater}0.9) covered only 2.5{\%}. R. alpina was predicted to occur mostly in broadleaved deciduous forest at 1000-1700. m a.s.l. with warm maximum spring temperatures and May and November precipitation {\textgreater}80. mm. We found a high degree of fragmentation; gaps were mainly covered with farmland or other unsuitable habitat. Over 52{\%} of potential habitat is unprotected. While the Natura 2000 network protects 42{\%} of potential habitat, parks and reserve covers less than 29{\%}. To preserve R. alpina, we urge to create, or restore, forest corridors to bridge the otherwise impermeable gaps our model detected and grant protection to the still largely unprotected area of the Italian territory e.g. by including it in further Natura 2000 sites. Models such as ours may also help focus field surveys in selected areas to save resources and increase survey success. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {The EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy requires the gathering of information on biodiversity to aid in monitoring progress towards its main targets. Common species are good proxies for the diversity and integrity of ecosystems, since they are key elements of the biomass, structure, functioning of ecosystems, and therefore of the supply of ecosystem services. In this sense, we aimed to develop a spatially-explicit indicator of habitat quality (HQI) at European level based on the species included in the European Common Bird Index, also grouped into their major habitat types (farmland and forest). Using species occurrences from the European Breeding Birds Atlas (at 50 km × 50 km) and the maximum entropy algorithm, we derived species distribution maps using refined occurrence data based on species ecology. This allowed us to cope with the limitations arising from modelling common and widespread species, obtaining habitat suitability maps for each species at finer spatial resolution (10 km × 10 km grid), which provided higher model accuracy. Analysis of the spatial patterns of local and relative species richness (defined as the ratio between species richness in a given location and the average richness in the regional context) for the common birds analysed demonstrated that the development of a HQI based on species richness needs to account for the regional species pool in order to make objective comparisons between regions. In this way, we proved that relative species richness compensated for the bias caused by the inherent heterogeneous patterns of the species distributions that was yielding larger local species richness in areas where most of the target species have the core of their distribution range. The method presented in this study provides a robust and innovative indicator of habitat quality which can be used to make comparisons between regions at the European scale, and therefore potentially applied to measure progress towards the EU Biodiversity Strategy targets. Finally, since species distribution models are based on breeding birds, the HQI can be also interpreted as a measure of the capacity of ecosystems to provide and maintain nursery/reproductive habitats for terrestrial species, a key maintenance and regulation ecosystem service. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

To determine these ecological characteristics of 5 Geocoris species for use in conservation efforts, an extensive sampling was done in 152 localities of Iran. A richness model was developed using a maximum entropy modelling approach (Maxent) and ArcGIS software for the five species based on collection records in conjunction with eight environmental variables. Maps for habitat overlap were created for paired species using ArcGIS 10.2 and ENMTools. The species displayed different overlapping niche ranges from 1.97{\%} to 37.25{\%} in pair-wise comparisons. For species richness three categories (habitats dominated by 0–1, 2–3, and 4–5 species) represented 38.44{\%}, 46.07{\%}, and 15.49{\%} of the modelled landscape, respectively. A direct relationship was found between humidity and the number of species present in different locations. Understanding the degree of ecological overlap between the Geocoris species, and their effective predation of aphids and mites, is critical in designing biological control methods in agroecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

abstract = {Aim: The use of ecological niche models (ENMs) to predict potential distributions of species is steadily increasing. A necessary assumption is that climatic niches are conservative, but recent findings of niche shifts during biological invasion indicate that this assumption is not always valid. Selection of predictor variables may be one reason for the observed shifts. In this paper we assess differences in climatic niches in the native and invaded ranges of the Mediterranean house gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus) in terms of commonly applied climate variables in ENMs. We analyse which variables are more conserved versus relaxed (i.e. subject to niche shift). Furthermore, we study the predictive power of different sets of climate variables. Location: The Mediterranean region and North America. Methods: We developed models using Maxent and various subsets of variables out of 19 bioclimatic layers including: (1) two subsets comprising almost all variables excluding only highly collinear ones; (2) two subsets with minimalistic variable sets of water availability and energy measures; (3) two subsets focused on temperature-related parameters; (4) two subsets with precipitation-related parameters; and (5) one subset comprising variables combining temperature and precipitation characteristics. Occurrence data from the native Mediterranean range were used to predict the potential introduced range in North America and vice versa. Degrees of niche similarity and conservatism were assessed using both Schoener's index and Hellinger distances. The significance of the results was tested using null models. Results: The degree of niche similarity and conservatism varied greatly among the predictors and variable sets applied. Shifts observed in some variables could be attributed to active habitat selection while others apparently reflected background effects. Main conclusions: The study was based on comprehensive occurrence data from all regions where Hemidactylus turcicus is present in Europe and North America, providing a robust foundation. Our results clearly indicate that the degree of conservatism of niches in H. turcicus largely varies among predictors and variable sets applied. Therefore, the extent of niche conservatism of variables applied should always be tested in ENMs. This has an important impact on studies of biological invasion, impacts of climate change and niche evolution. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The native tropical seaweed Kappaphycus alvarezii from the Indo-Pacific region has been introduced in many countries because it is the main source of raw material for the carrageenan industry. In Brazil, K. alvarezii aquaculture is allowed in 300. km of the southeastern coast. The aim of this study was to analyze the risk of invasion of this species along the entire Brazilian coast to design public policies and to minimize environmental risks associated with aquaculture. The risk analysis was based on: K. alvarezii suitability models (GARP and MAXENT), coral reef presence, substrate preferences for establishment, and the probability of occurrence of nine species of herbivores that are potential feeders. An invasibility index was created from these parameters and published data of field experiments were used for calibration. The maximum values of suitability corresponded to regions with low temperature ranges, low nitrate availability, high irradiance, and high salinity. Three invasion risk classes were established. The areas of high risk are the eastern and northeastern regions, where the main Atlantic coral reefs are found. This is a priority area for global marine conservation. K. alvarezii introduction is not recommended in this area and the cultivation of native species must be prioritized. The area of medium risk is mainly in the northern region, where local field scale experiments are recommended before widespread introduction. The area of low risk is the southeastern region, where K. alvarezii farming has been established since 2004 with no evidence of invasion. However, considering the high capacity of acclimation of this species, permanent monitoring is recommended, even in areas having a low risk of invasion. Statement of relevance: We state the relevance of our paper in commercial aquaculture since we presented a consistent environmental risk analysis for K. alvarezii that according to FAO is the most cultivated seaweed in the world. Our aim is to contribute for development of sustainable seaweed aquaculture, subsiding data to minimize environmental risks associated with K. alvarezii introduction. This kind of analysis also can be adapted to other countries. Our results indicate safe areas to extend K. alvarezii cultivation, areas where the native seaweed should be cultivated and with those conclusions encouraging the expansion of the commercial seaweed aquaculture and highlight for high environmental risks in coral reef areas. {\textcopyright} 2015.},

The current study was conducted to map the distribution of current and future climatic niche of endangered Himalayan musk deer, a species endemic to Asia. Maxent and GARP modeling algorithms were individually employed to forecast current and future climatic niche of the species using randomly collected occurrence records of the species and bioclimatic variables with 30″ resolution from ‘WorldClim' datasets. Both the modeling processes performed optimally with regard to AUC and TSS values and forecasted an increase/expansion of climatically-suitable geographical space in the future. A final climatic niche distribution map was produced by combining the binary maps generated from each of the processes to produce a relatively realistic and potentially accurate distribution of climatic niche of the species over space and time. Conservation of forecasted suitable geographical space is recommended and future survey efforts for potentially unexplored populations of the species in the forecasted suitable area are suggested. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Today, only relict populations remain in Ethiopia and Eritrea. The current Ethiopian population persists in the Danakil Desert at a very low density. Wildlife managers need to identify the extent of the remaining suitable habitat and understand human-wildlife interactions for appropriate conservation strategies. This study employed the maximum entropy model (Maxent) to determine suitable habitat and seasonal distribution of African wild ass in the Danakil Desert of Ethiopia. Field surveys were conducted four times annually, twice during the wet season and twice during the dry season, for 2 years. Field data and predictor variables were separated into the dry and wet seasons, and models were generated for each season independently. Distance from water, distance from settlements, herbaceous cover and slope were the best predictors of suitable habitat for both dry and wet seasons. Evaluations of model performances were high with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.94 and 0.95 for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Our results will be critical for identifying the available suitable habitat that should be conserved to safeguard this species from extinction. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {This article addresses error detection in broadcast news automatic transcription, as a post-processing stage. Based on the observation that many errors appear in bursts, we investigated the use of Markov Chains (MC) for their temporal modelling capabilities. Experiments were conducted on a large Amercian English broadcast news corpus from NIST. Common features in error detection were used, all decoder-based. MC classification performance was compared with a discriminative maximum entropy model (Maxent), currently used in our in-house decoder to estimate confidence measures, and also with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The MC classifier obtained the best results, by detecting 16.2{\%} of the errors, with the lowest classification error rate of 16.7{\%}. To be compared with the GMM classifier, MC allowed to lower the number of false detections, by 23.5{\%} relative. The Maxent system achieved the same CER, but detected only 7.2{\%} of the errors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {We generated a risk map to forecast the potential effects of the spreading of zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha across the Italian territory. We assessed the invader's potential impact on rivers, lakes, watersheds and dams at a fine-grained scale and detected those more at risk that should be targeted with appropriate monitoring. We developed a MaxEnt model and employed weighted overlay analyses to detect the species' potential distribution and generate risk maps for Italy. D. polymorpha has a greater probability of occurring at low to medium altitudes in areas characterised by fluviatile deposits of major streams. Northern and central Italy appear more at risk. Some hydroelectric power dams are at high risk, while most dams for irrigation, drinkable water reservoirs and other dam types are at medium to low risk. The lakes and rivers reaches (representing likely expansion pathways) at medium-high or high risk mostly occur in northern and central Italy. We highlight the importance of modelling potential invasions on a country scale to achieve the sufficient resolution needed to develop appropriate monitoring plans and prevent the invader's harmful effects. Further high-resolution risk maps are needed for other regions partly or not yet colonised by the zebra mussel. {\textcopyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

In previous work, we have developed hiddenMarkov model (HMM) and maximum entropy (Maxent) classifiers that integrate textual and prosodic knowledge sources for detecting sentence boundaries. In this paper, we evaluate the use of a conditional random field (CRF) for this task and relate results with this model to our prior work. We evaluate across two corpora (conversational telephone speech and broadcast news speech) on both human transcriptions and speech recognition output. In general, our CRF model yields a lower error rate than the HMM and Maxent models on the NIST sentence boundary detection task in speech, although it is interesting to note that the best results are achieved by three-way voting among the classifiers. This probably occurs because each model has different strengths and weaknesses for modeling the knowledge sources. {\textcopyright} 2005 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

In the present study, we predicted the probable distribution of two invasive plant species Mimosa diplotricha Sauvalle and Mikania micrantha Kunth in a protected tropical grassland of Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park, Assam, Northeast India using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) distribution modelling algorithm. We found that about 30–40{\%} (25–30 km2) area of the protected area (78.8 km2) have high chances of being invaded by both the invasive plants that are prime habitat to the greater one horned Rhinoceros and other important grassland dwellers. Both the models have an accuracy of AUC {\textgreater} 0.99. Precipitation in warmest quarters played a major role among the environmental variables in spread of both the invasive plants. The findings of the present study will help the management authority to take the necessary steps in the identified area to chalk out a comprehensive strategy for control of the invasive plant species. The probable areas most likely to be invaded by the invasive plant species have to be monitored regularly, and intervention like manual uprooting needs to be scheduled during the early stage of its life cycle and before flowering.

This population is comprised of facultative, elevational winter migrants and access to winter habitat is an important component of their ecology. Winter observations and remotely sensed habitat variables were used to inform a predictive model of the environmental requirements and geographic distribution of this owl population. Using the modeled distribution map we assessed the distribution of 20{\%} probability of occurrence classes relative to owl habitat associations, ownership, current development, and projected future development patterns. Our findings indicate that high probability class (81-100{\%}) areas and the broader joint medium/medium-high/high probability class (41-100{\%}) areas are uncommon on the landscape (0.2{\%} and 5.0{\%} of study area, respectively). High probability areas were characterized by Sierran Yellow Pine forest surrounding relatively small, flat areas of grassland, wet meadow, and riparian habitats, within the mid-elevation range. Approximately 32{\%} of the high probability areas and 48{\%} of the medium/medium-high/high probability areas occur on private lands. Of the areas on private lands, 32{\%} of the high probability and 42{\%} of the medium/medium-high/high probability areas occur on currently developed lands. Projected future development on private lands indicated that an additional 12{\%} of the high and 18{\%} of medium/medium-high/high suitability areas are slated for development by the year 2040. Future conservation planning efforts for the great gray owl in the Sierra Nevada will need to address management issues on both public and private lands. For future planning of development projects around great gray owl wintering habitat, the results from our study supplement current knowledge of breeding distributions to provide land and wildlife managers guidance on conservation priorities. {\textcopyright} The Wildlife Society, 2011.},

It is medicinally important: tubers are nutritive and edible, leaves are digestive and a cure for dysentery and diarrhea. Exploitation for its tubers and poor regeneration of this species has shrunk its distribution. In order to know its present status, we report here the results of its appraisal in Rajasthan, using remote sensing and ground truthing in the past five years (2009-14). A base map of C. bulbosa was prepared using Geographical Information System (GIS), open source software Quantum GIS, SAGA. The Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) +Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Satellite Data were used in this study. ASTER and GDEM Data was clipped with district boundary and provided color range to get elevation information. A digital elevation model of Rajasthan physiography was developed from ASTER GDEM of 30-m resolution. GIS layers of Area of occurrences for C. bulbosa plant and elevation were created. This map along with topographic sheets of 1:50000 were used for field traversing and ground truthing as per GPS location inferred from map. Its geographic distribution was assessed using MaxEnt distribution modelling algorithm that employed 12 presence locality data, 19 bioclimatic variables, and elevation data. Results of this modelling predicted occurrence of C. bulbosa in the districts of Sirohi, Jalore, Barmer, Pali, Ajmer, Jhalawar, Dungarpur, Banswara, Baran, Kota, Bundi and Chittorgarh. Ground validation in these districts revealed its presence only at four places in three districts confirming its rarity. Analysis of dominance at their sites of occurrence revealed their poor populations and sub dominant status (RIV= 20-32) and very low density (2-12 plants per tenth ha).},

abstract = {Terrestrial plant invaders (TPIs) have a large potential to threaten plant diversity under climate change. To prevent the spread of TPIs under climate change, we must identify the risk hotspots for TPIs. However, the risk hotspots for TPIs have not yet been explicitly addressed at the global scale under climate change. Here, we selected 336 TPIs from the Invasive Species Specialist Group list and used species distribution modelling and Hot Spot Analysis to map the risk hotspots of TPIs based on the terrestrial ecoregions in the current, low and high gas concentration scenarios. The risk hotspots of TPIs were mainly distributed in South America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and northern and southern Africa. Climate change may decrease the areas of hotspots that allow for TPI expansion, but the potential distribution probabilities of TPIs may increase in the high concentration scenario. Furthermore, TPIs, particularly herbaceous and woody ones, might still expand into critical or endangered ecoregions of these risk hotspots in the current, low and high concentration scenarios. We also need to focus on the impact of TPI expansion on both vulnerable and relatively stable ecoregions due to the increasing potential distribution probabilities of TPIs in risk hotspots and should integrate climate change into the risk assessment of plant invasion in the vulnerable and relatively stable ecoregions. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This study aimed to predict the geographical distribution of Artemisia sieberi and find the influential variables in the distribution of A. sieberi in the desert rangelands of central Iran. Maps of environmental variables were generated by GIS software (version 9.3). Predictive distribution maps of A. sieberi were produced with Maximum Entropy Method (MaxEnt) and the existing data regarding this species. The agreement of predictive map with the actual map was checked by calculating Kappa coefficient value. Accuracy of predictive models was evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Results showed that soil pH and lime content in the surface layer (0-30 cm) and silt percent in both surface and sub-surface soil depths (0-30 and 30-60) had the greatest impacts on the distribution of A. sieberi in the study area. Correspondence of actual map with the predictive one was assessed at a satisfactory level (Kappa coefficient = 0.70). MaxEnt is widely used as compared with the other standard methods since it only requires the presence data of a specific plant species to draw the distribution map of its habitat. Additionally, MaxEnt is a generative method and its output can be easily understood by the field practitioners.},

abstract = {Sea-level rise is expected to dramatically alter low-lying coastal and intertidal areas, which provide important habitat for shoreline-dependent species. The Snowy Plover ( Charadrius alexandrinus) is a threatened shorebird that relies on Florida Gulf Coast sandy beaches for nesting and breeding. Selecting a management strategy for the conservation of this species under sea-level rise is a complex task that entails the consideration of multiple streams of information, stakeholder preferences, value judgments, and uncertainty. We use a spatially explicit linked modeling process that incorporates geomorphological (SLAMM), habitat (MaxEnt), and metapopulation (RAMAS GIS) models to simulate the effect of sea-level rise on Snowy Plover populations. We then apply multi-criteria decision analysis to identify preferred management strategies for the conservation of the species. Results show that nest exclosures are the most promising conservation strategy followed by predator management, species focused beach nourishment, and no action. Uncertainty in these results remains an important concern, and a better understanding of decision-maker preferences and the Snowy Plover's life history would improve the reliability of the results. This is an innovative method for planning for sea-level rise through pairing a linked modeling system with decision analysis to provide management focused results under an inherently uncertain future. {\textcopyright} 2013 .},

Most wildfires in the north-eastern US occur in the wildland-urban interface, those regions of intermingling urban and non-developed vegetated lands, where access to firefighting resources can be limited. We created monthly wildfire ignition probability maps from environmental predictors and wildfires occurring between 2000 and 2009 for the states of New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Predictor variables included a drought index, long-term soil moisture, percentage forest and wildland-urban interface classifications. Probability maps generated from modelled (Maxent) extrapolations were used to create monthly hazard maps to aid agencies and managers with resource allocation and likelihood projections of wildfires across the region. Our results suggest that monthly hazard assessments provide a better indication of potential wildfires than does a single mean annual probability.

abstract = {Questions: Which environmental variables influence grass diversity in West Africa? What are the effects of climate and grass functional traits on the spatial patterns (richness and abundance) of the grass clades Andropogoneae, Paniceae and Chloridoideae? Location: West Africa, demarcated by the Atlantic Ocean in the west and south (20° W and 4° N), the Sahara desert in the north (25° N) and the border between Niger and Chad in the east (20° E). Methods: Based on 38 912 georeferenced occurrence records, we modelled the distribution of 302 grass species (51{\%} of West African grass diversity). We integrated species richness, abundance and functional traits (life cycle, photosynthetic type and height) to determine the contribution of the most speciose grass clades (Andropogoneae, Paniceae and Chloridoideae) to overall grass diversity in West Africa. Results: Precipitation is the variable most often influencing the species distribution models of grasses in West Africa. Richness and relative abundance of the tribe Andropogoneae show a centre of diversity in Sudanian savanna regions. The height of Andropogoneae species, generally {\textgreater}150 cm, is driving this ecological dominance. Species richness of the tribe Paniceae is more dispersed and shows two main centres of abundance: The southern regions with higher mean annual precipitation and tree density are dominated by C3 Paniceae species. The Sahelian regions in the north are dominated by short Paniceae species with the C4 NAD-ME photosynthetic subtype, as well as Chloridoideae possessing the same functional attributes. Conclusions: Our study provides insight into the environmental correlates of grass species richness in West Africa and contributes to the much-needed research on tropical rangelands. Moreover, the integration of evolutionary history significantly improves our understanding of large-scale biodiversity patterns. {\textcopyright} 2016 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

Models were first trained using two calibration areas: the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF) and the whole of South America (SA). All modeling methods showed good levels of predictive power and accuracy with mean AUC ranging from 0.77 (BIOCLIM/BAF) to 0.99 (MAXENT/SA). MAXENT and SVM were the most accurate presence-only methods among those tested here. All but the SVM models calibrated with SA predicted larger distribution areas when compared to models calibrated in BAF. OM-GARP dramatically overpredicted the species distribution for the model calibrated in SA, with a predicted area around 106 km2 larger than predicted by other SDMs. With increased calibration area (and environmental space), OM-GARP predictions followed changes in the environmental space associated with the increased calibration area, while MAXENT models were more consistent across calibration areas. MAXENT was the only method that retrieved consistent predictions across calibration areas, while allowing for some overprediction, a result that may be relevant for modeling the distribution of other spatially restricted organisms. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This study employed Maxent modeling to investigate the geographic distribution of goitered gazelle, Gazella subgutturosa (Guldenstadt, 1780), in central Iran using uncorrelated variables at a spatial resolution of 250 m. We used spatial downscaling to downscale WorldClim data to 250-m resolution. We evaluated the sensitivity of the model to different grain and extent sizes from 250 m to 3 km. We compared the performance of the model at different scales using suitability indexes (AUC) and predicted habitat areas. Two models performed with AUC values higher than random (AUCun = 0.957, AUCpu = 0.953). The distribution of potential habitats at 250- m grid size was strongly influenced by bioclimatic data, vegetation type and density, and elevation. There were few spatial divergences between uncorrelated and pruned models. The mean AUC across eight different spatial scales ranged from 0.936 to 0.959. There was a significant negative correlation between grain size and AUC (R2 = 0.57). An increase in grain size increased the predicted habitat area. The extent size and AUC showed a positive correlation (R2 = 0.18). Predicted suitability habitat also decreased as extent size increased (R2 = 0.49). Spatial congruence AUC fluctuated within a small range and the maximum difference occurred between models of 1 × 1 and 2.5 × 2.5 km. These results showed that an increase in extent size is more accurate than an increase in grain size, and the maximum accuracy for predicting distribution of goitered gazelle in Iran was obtained if the grain size and extent size were 750 m. {\textcopyright} T{\"{U}}BİTAK.},

abstract = {The spiny rats of the genus Trinomys Thomas, 1921 have a broad distribution in the Atlantic Forests of southeastern Brazil. However, some species are known only from their type locality and adjacent areas. In our study, nine areas in the state of Rio de Janeiro were surveyed and three species of the genus were captured - Trinomys dimidiatus (G{\"{u}}nther, 1877), T. setosus (Desmarest, 1817) and T. gratiosus bonafidei (Moojen, 1948). We extended the distribution of T. gratiosus bonafidei in 100 km, in a straight line to the northwest, and into an area of Semidecidual Seasonal Forest. We captured T. setosus, which had not been previously recorded in the state, in the municipality of Cambuci, extending its distribution 150 km, in a straight line to the east of its closest record, in Juiz de Fora, state of Minas Gerais. The state of Rio de Janeiro has now six recognized species of Trinomys, however none of them were collected above 1300 m of altitude. We used occurrence points provided by our inventories data and from the literature to model the potential distribution of Trinomys species. We used climatic, topographic and phytogeographic variables to prepare the potential distribution maps. The algorithm used for modeling was provided by the software Maxent, version 3.2.1. Although species boundaries within Trinomys in Rio de Janeiro State are not yet clear, their distributions seem to be parapatric, except for T. iheringi and T. dimidiatus. {\textcopyright} 2009 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.},

abstract = {To understand patterns of biodiversity and whether populations and species are in decline, the detection and description of cryptic biodiversity are essential. Salamanders are of particular conservation interest because they potentially harbor many undescribed species due to morphological conservatism. The dusky salamanders, genus Desmognathus, are a species-rich group in which morphologically cryptic species are especially common. Using a portion of the mitochondrial genome and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), we investigated the genetic diversity of the highly endemic, stream-dwelling salamander, Desmognathus folkertsi, across its known range in the Appalachian Mountains. Mitochondrial data revealed three well-supported lineages, one of which consisted of only one specimen; however, AFLP data were not congruent with the mitochondrial data. There was 1. 11{\%} uncorrected sequence divergence between the two well-sampled lineages. Desmognathus folkertsi exhibited 4. 29{\%} sequence divergence from the closely related D. quadramaculatus. Isolation by distance was found for both the AFLP and mitochondrial data when stream distance, rather than when straight-line (i. e., geographic) distance was used. Although genetic diversity is often partitioned by river drainages in freshwater taxa, we did not observe such a pattern in D. folkertsi. We propose that human-mediated dispersal by bait-bucket release may augment natural gene flow via aquatic dispersal across streams. Because this species was only recently discovered, the full extent of the geographic range is unknown. Therefore, an ecological niche model, using climate variables and the Maxent algorithm, was used to determine whether additional regions may be suitable for the species. The model predicted a small range limited to extreme southwestern North Carolina and extreme northeastern Georgia. We suggest future surveys be focused in these regions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The popularity of MaxEnt in species distribution modeling has been driven by several factors including its high degree of accuracy, and flexibility to tailor efforts to species-specific situations. Although many recent studies have identified the importance of adjusting mathematical transformation (feature class) and regularization of coefficient values, collectively known as tuning, few studies have addressed the need to customize the variables used in species distribution modeling, and use unselected variable sets. This study presents two novel methods to select for environmental variables in MaxEnt. The first involves selecting from a priori determined environmental variable sets (pre-selected based on ecological or biological knowledge), and the second utilizes a reiterative process of model formation and stepwise removal of least contributing variables. Both methods were tested on eight known species of invasive crayfish, with results reinforcing the need for species-specific environmental variable sets. While the reiterative process generally performs better than the a priori selected variables, selection of method can be based on information availability. These techniques appear to outperform the current practice of utilizing unselected variable sets and is especially important considering the increasing application of species distribution modeling (across spatial and temporal barriers) in conservation and management efforts whereby inaccurate predictions might have adverse effects. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background: The Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys (St{\aa}l) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), native to Asia, is becoming an invasive species with a rapidly expanding range in North America and Europe. In the US, it is a household pest and also caused unprecedented damage to agriculture crops. Exploring its climatic limits and estimating its potential geographic distribution can provide critical information for management strategies. Methodology/Principals: We used direct climate comparisons to explore the climatic niche occupied by native and invasive populations of BMSB. Ecological niche modelings based on the native range were used to anticipate the potential distribution of BMSB worldwide. Conversely, niche models based on the introduced range were used to locate the original invasive propagates in Asia. Areas with high invasion potential were identified by two niche modeling algorithms (i.e., Maxent and GARP). Conclusions/Significance: Reduced dimensionality of environmental space improves native model transferability in the invade area. Projecting models from invasive population back to native distributional areas offers valuable information on the potential source regions of the invasive populations. Our models anticipated successfully the current disjunct distribution of BMSB in the US. The original propagates are hypothesized to have come from northern Japan or western Korea. High climate suitable areas at risk of invasion include latitudes between 30°-50° including northern Europe, northeastern North America, southern Australia and the North Island of New Zealand. Angola in Africa and Uruguay in South America also showed high climate suitability. {\textcopyright} 2012 Zhu et al.},

Black pepper is naturally distributed in India in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot and is the only known existing source of its wild germplasm in the world. We used ecological niche models to predict the potential distribution of wild P. nigrum in the present and two future climate change scenarios viz (A1B) and (A2A) for the year 2080. Three topographic and nine uncorrelated bioclim variables were used to develop the niche models. The environmental variables influencing the distribution of wild P. nigrum across different climate change scenarios were identified. We also assessed the direction and magnitude of the niche centroid shift and the change in niche breadth to estimate the impact of projected climate change on the distribution of P. nigrum. The study shows a niche centroid shift in the future climate scenarios. Both the projected future climate scenarios predicted a reduction in the habitat of P. nigrum in Southern Western Ghats, which harbors many wild accessions of P. nigrum. Our results highlight the impact of future climate change on P. nigrum and provide useful information for designing sound germplasm conservation strategies for P. nigrum. {\textcopyright} 2016, The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer Japan.},

abstract = {Indigenous fruit tree species such as tamarind (Tamarindus indica L.) in African sub-Saharan traditionally act to build resilience into the farming system in terms of food security, income generation and ecosystem stability. Therefore, increasing our knowledge on their ecology and distribution is a priority. Tamarind is mainly grown for the fruits but is also a valuable timber species. The fruit pulp has a high content of vitamin B and is eaten fresh or made into jam, chutney, juice or sweets. Flowers, leaves and seeds are also edible and used in a variety of dishes. The main objective of this study is to evaluate actual density of tamarind in Senegal and the climate change effects on its distribution for better conservation strategies. Tamarind's distribution and density around villages were recorded and modelled in different agro-ecological zones in Senegal using transect method and under current and future climates. Distribution under two future climate scenarios were modelled using four climate models and three time slices (2020, 2050 and 2080). Results show a decreasing gradient in tree density (from 7 to 1 trees km-2) from the Sudano agro-ecological zone (in the south) to the Sahel (in the north). Future climate predictions show that although tamarind distribution will increase in the north-west and south of the country in 2020; by 2050, the area identified as suitable for its growth will be greatly reduced. Areas in the north-west basin appear to be an important refugia for the species under future climate conditions. However, density around villages in this area was found to be relatively low indicating that this could lead to problems of poor connectivity and inbreeding depression. This region should therefore be highlighted as important conservative management and protection strategies of tamarind in this region. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Wildlife habitat mapping has evolved at a rapid pace over the last few decades. Beginning with simple, often subjective, hand-drawn maps, habitat mapping now involves complex species distribution models (SDMs) using mapped predictor variables derived from remotely sensed data. For species that inhabit large geographic areas, remote sensing technology is often essential for producing range wide maps. Habitat monitoring for northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina), whose geographic covers about 23. million. ha, is based on SDMs that use Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery to create forest vegetation data layers using gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) methods. Vegetation data layers derived from GNN are modeled relationships between forest inventory plot data, climate and topographic data, and the spectral signatures acquired by the satellite. When used as predictor variables for SDMs, there is some transference of the GNN modeling error to the final habitat map.Recent increases in the use of light detection and ranging (lidar) data, coupled with the need to produce spatially accurate and detailed forest vegetation maps have spurred interest in its use for SDMs and habitat mapping. Instead of modeling predictor variables from remotely sensed spectral data, lidar provides direct measurements of vegetation height for use in SDMs. We expect a SDM habitat map produced from directly measured predictor variables to be more accurate than one produced from modeled predictors.We used maximum entropy (Maxent) SDM modeling software to compare predictive performance and estimates of habitat area between Landsat-based and lidar-based northern spotted owl SDMs and habitat maps. We explored the differences and similarities between these maps, and to a pre-existing aerial photo-interpreted habitat map produced by local wildlife biologists. The lidar-based map had the highest predictive performance based on 10 bootstrapped replicate models (AUC. = 0.809 ± 0.011), but the performance of the Landsat-based map was within acceptable limits (AUC. = 0.717 ± 0.021). As is common with photo-interpreted maps, there was no accuracy assessment available for comparison. The photo-interpreted map produced the highest and lowest estimates of habitat area, depending on which habitat classes were included (nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat. = 9962. ha, nesting habitat only. = 6036. ha). The Landsat-based map produced an estimate of habitat area that was within this range (95{\%} CI: 6679-9592. ha), while the lidar-based map produced an area estimate similar to what was interpreted by local wildlife biologists as nesting (i.e., high quality) habitat using aerial imagery (95{\%} CI: 5453-7216). Confidence intervals of habitat area estimates from the SDMs based on Landsat and lidar overlapped.We concluded that both Landsat- and lidar-based SDMs produced reasonable maps and area estimates for northern spotted owl habitat within the study area. The lidar-based map was more precise and spatially similar to what local wildlife biologists considered spotted owl nesting habitat. The Landsat-based map provided a less precise spatial representation of habitat within the relatively small geographic confines of the study area, but habitat area estimates were similar to both the photo-interpreted and lidar-based maps.Photo-interpreted maps are time consuming to produce, subjective in nature, and difficult to replicate. SDMs provide a framework for efficiently producing habitat maps that can be replicated as habitat conditions change over time, provided that comparable remotely sensed data are available. When the SDM uses predictor variables extracted from lidar data, it can produce a habitat map that is both accurate and useful at large and small spatial scales. In comparison, SDMs using Landsat-based data are more appropriate for large scale analyses of amounts and general spatial patterns of habitat at regional scales. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

It is used in different ailments of obesity, arthritis, rheumatism and high cholesterol. Due to overexploitation its natural populations declined to large extent. IUCN has put it under Data Deficient (DD) category due to lack of data on its extent of occurrence in nature. Hence, the study was carried out using MaxEnt distribution modelling algorithm to estimate its geographic distribution and to identify potential habitats for its reintroduction. For modelling employed 68 presence locality data, 19 bioclimatic variables, Normalize Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and elevation data. These were tested for multicollinearity and those variables having r-value less than 0.8 were selected for further analysis, which was carried out in two ways i) Bioclimatic variables and elevation; ii) NDVI and elevation. Area Under the Curve (AUC) in both analysis was above 0.9 for all variables, indicating very high accuracy of prediction. Variables governing distribution of C. wightii in the analysis using bioclimatic and elevation data set are precipitation seasonality (56.6{\%}),annual precipitation (16.4{\%}) and elevation (14.7{\%}). Extent of occurrence of C.wightii predicted by model closely matched in the districts of Jaisalmer and Barmer. In the second analysis elevation (48.3{\%}), NDVI of June (11.1{\%}) and August (11.2{\%}) contributed for NDVI and Elevation data set. NDVI of June corresponds to its leafing phase while NDVI of August to flowering phase. Area of its occurrence predicted for NDVI and elevation data set are Bikaner, Churu, Jhunjhunun some part of Jodhpur which are completely sandy, where C. wightii is totally absent. Extent of occurrence was also validated in ground survey. Potential areas for its reintroduction were identified as Jaisalmer and Barmer districts in Indian arid zone.},

Species distribution models have become important tools to test biogeographical, ecological and evolutionary hypotheses. Moreover, from an ecological and evolutionary perspective, these models help to elucidate the spatial strategies of species at a regional scale. We modelled species distributions of two phylogenetically, geographically and ecologically close Tupinambis species (Teiidae) that occupy the southernmost area of the genus distribution in South America. We hypothesized that similarities between these species might have induced spatial strategies at the species level, such as niche differentiation and divergence of distribution patterns at a regional scale. Using logistic regression and MaxEnt we obtained species distribution models that revealed interspecific differences in habitat requirements, such as environmental temperature, precipitation and altitude. Moreover, the models obtained suggest that although the ecological niches of Tupinambis merianae and T. rufescens are different, these species might co-occur in a large contact zone.We propose that niche plasticity could be the mechanism enabling their co-occurrence. Therefore, the approach used here allowed us to understand the spatial strategies of two Tupinambis lizards at a regional scale. {\textcopyright} 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

abstract = {Terrestrial long-distance migrations are declining globally: in North America, nearly 75{\%} have been lost. Yet there has been limited research comparing habitat suitability and connectivity models to identify migration corridors across increasingly fragmented landscapes. Here we use pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) migrations in prairie habitat to compare two types of models that identify habitat suitability: maximum entropy (Maxent) and expert-based (Analytic Hierarchy Process). We used distance to wells, distance to water, NDVI, land cover, distance to roads, terrain shape and fence presence to parameterize the models. We then used the output of these models as cost surfaces to compare two common connectivity models, least-cost modeling (LCM) and circuit theory. Using pronghorn movement data from spring and fall migrations, we identified potential migration corridors by combining each habitat suitability model with each connectivity model. The best performing model combination was Maxent with LCM corridors across both seasons. Maxent out-performed expert-based habitat suitability models for both spring and fall migrations. However, expert-based corridors can perform relatively well and are a cost-effective alternative if species location data are unavailable. Corridors created using LCM out-performed circuit theory, as measured by the number of pronghorn GPS locations present within the corridors. We suggest the use of a tiered approach using different corridor widths for prioritizing conservation and mitigation actions, such as fence removal or conservation easements. {\textcopyright} 2012 Poor et al.},

abstract = {Recent advances in ecological modeling have focused on novel methods for characterizing the environment that use presence-only data and machine-learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of species occurrence. These novel methods may have great potential for land suitability applications in the developing world where detailed land cover information is often unavailable or incomplete. This paper assesses the adaptation and application of the presence-only geographic species distribution model, MaxEnt, for agricultural crop suitability mapping in a rural Thailand where lowland paddy rice and upland field crops predominant. To assess this modeling approach, three independent crop presence datasets were used including a social-demographic survey of farm households, a remote sensing classification of land use/land cover, and ground control points, used for geodetic and thematic reference that vary in their geographic distribution and sample size. Disparate environmental data were integrated to characterize environmental settings across Nang Rong District, a region of approximately 1300. sq. km in size. Results indicate that the MaxEnt model is capable of modeling crop suitability for upland and lowland crops, including rice varieties, although model results varied between datasets due to the high sensitivity of the model to the distribution of observed crop locations in geographic and environmental space. Accuracy assessments indicate that model outcomes were influenced by the sample size and the distribution of sample points in geographic and environmental space. The need for further research into accuracy assessments of presence-only models lacking true absence data is discussed. We conclude that the MaxEnt model can provide good estimates of crop suitability, but many areas need to be carefully scrutinized including geographic distribution of input data and assessment methods to ensure realistic modeling results. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Although well-studied vertebrates such as the Northern Spotted Owl (NSO) are often used as focal species in regional conservation plans, range shifts associated with climate change may compromise this role. I used the Maxent (maximum entropy) method to develop NSO distribution models from data on NSO locations, forest age, and an ensemble of climate projections. NSO presence was positively associated with the proportion of old and mature forest at two spatial scales. Winter precipitation was the most important climate variable, consistent with previous studies suggesting negative effects on survival and recruitment. Model results suggest that initial niche expansion may be followed by a contraction as climate change intensifies, but this prediction is uncertain due to variability in predicted changes in precipitation between climate projections. Although new reserves created by the US Northwest Forest Plan prioritized areas with greater biological importance for the NSO than did pre-existing reserves, the latter areas, which lie predominantly at higher elevations, increase in importance under climate change. In contrast with previous analyses of the region's localized old-forest-associated species, vegetation rather than climate dominated NSO distribution models. Rigorous assessment of the implications of climate change for focal species requires development of dynamic vegetation models that incorporate effects of competitor species and altered disturbance regimes. The results suggest that, lacking such data, models that combine climate data with current data on habitat factors such as vegetation can inform conservation planning by providing less-biased estimates of potential range shifts than do niche models based on climate variables alone. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {From a mechanistic viewpoint, it is desirable to predict the distribution of species based on ecological parameters (e.g. rainfall or temperature) that are causal factors for their distribution. Data for such ecological factors are difficult or expensive to collect and are usually insufficient. Terrain-related variables are used as proxies of ecological factors in the study since data for them can be easily obtained by remote sensing. Taiwan red cypress (TRC) grow in fog-forest belt (FFB) with rich moisture brought by northeastern (NE) season wind but with lower solar radiation due to high moisture in fogs and clouds. TRCs grow on the north part of the study area, but almost do not grow in the Huisun Experimental Forest Station (HEFS), except Shou-Cheng Mountain, in the south part of the study area. The study attempted to determine if the NE wind blocked by topographic obstacles is a key to above-mentioned distribution by reversely thinking their positive effect with another case of Taiwan fir. Topographic sheltering index (TSI) thus was developed. The accuracy of ecological niche model (ENM) using MAXENT with elevation plus TSI was better than that of the ENM using MAXENT with elevation plus slope, NDVI, and PCT bands. Consequently, TSI was useful for explaining the above-mentioned distribution. Moreover, the greater the TSI, the fewer TRCs grow in the study area, especially in the HEFS due to the negative effect of topographic obstacles opposite to the case of Taiwan fir. This proxy therefore may be a critical predictor variable for ENMs. The rise in accuracy is relatively limited despite TSI improving the predictive ability of these ENMs. Hence, the more refined TSI, the proxy of solar radiation (SR), and high-resolution DEM will be included into ENMS so that their predictive ability can be greatly improved.},

abstract = {This study was conducted in Dez and Karkheh regions in southwestern Iran to model habitat suitability of the Persian fallow deer Dama dama mesopotamicus and assessing trend of habitat changes since 1989. A total of 22 confirmed presence records of the species were collected from 1988 to 2003. MaxEnt approach was used to develop habitat suitability model with regards to nine environmental variables, including density of farmlands, forests, and disturbed forests, density of livestock, vegetation, residential areas and distance to the forest edge, residential areas, protected areas and frequency of surface water bodies. After validation of the model for all parameters used for 1989, relative developed map was extrapolated to the habitat conditions in 2007. Comparing the habitat suitability maps developed for 1989 and 2007 reveals that area of suitable habitats for the Persian fallow deer has declined by 30{\%} within 18 years. A total of 1000 ha of forests (within suitable habitats for the species) has been degraded. About 100 ha of these habitats were converted to farmlands and less than 0.5 ha was altered to the residential areas. In addition, area of about 1000 ha has lost the suitability without any land use changes. Currently, reintroduction of the Persian fallow deer to the area is under consideration by Department of Environment of Iran. Therefore, results of this study are recommended for choosing reintroduction sites based on the predicted suitable maps to enhance the probability of survival for reintroduced individuals. {\textcopyright} 2015, University of Tehran.

abstract = {When predicting the potential and future invasive range of a species, there is a growing appreciation that insights about factors limiting distributions can be provided by using multiple modelling approaches and by incorporating information from different parts of a species range. Here we apply this strategy to build on previous CLIMEX models to predict the invasion potential of Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, in mainland Australia. A combination of CLIMEX and MAXENT modelling indicated that the mosquito was expected to become widespread along the eastern seaboard and extend into northern Tasmania, but to remain restricted to the coastal fringe, a pattern which is not expected to shift much under climate change. However, a recent expansion of A.albopictus in North America points to evolutionary changes affecting the distribution of this species; when the North American range is included in models, A.albopictus is predicted to become much more widespread and extend inland and into Western Australia. These patterns highlight the potential impact of evolution on species distributions arising from multiple introductions or in situ evolution. By considering future climate scenarios, we demonstrate that there is likely to be a persistent public health threat associated with invasion by this species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Ecological Society of Australia.},

abstract = {Background: For {\textgreater}100 years cattle production in the southern United States has been threatened by cattle fever. It is caused by an invasive parasite-vector complex that includes the protozoan hemoparasites Babesia bovis and B. bigemina, which are transmitted among domestic cattle via Rhipicephalus tick vectors of the subgenus Boophilus. In 1906 an eradication effort was started and by 1943 Boophilus ticks had been confined to a narrow tick eradication quarantine area (TEQA) along the Texas-Mexico border. However, a dramatic increase in tick infestations in areas outside the TEQA over the last decade suggests these tick vectors may be poised to re-invade the southern United States. We investigated historical and potential future distributions of climatic habitats of cattle fever ticks to assess the potential for a range expansion. Methods. We built robust spatial predictions of habitat suitability for the vector species Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus and R. (B.) annulatus across the southern United States for three time periods: 1906, present day (2012), and 2050. We used analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) to identify persistent tick occurrences and analysis of bias in the climate proximate to these occurrences to identify key environmental parameters associated with the ecology of both species. We then used ecological niche modeling algorithms GARP and Maxent to construct models that related known occurrences of ticks in the TEQA during 2001-2011 with geospatial data layers that summarized important climate parameters at all three time periods. Results: We identified persistent tick infestations and specific climate parameters that appear to be drivers of ecological niches of the two tick species. Spatial models projected onto climate data representative of climate in 1906 reproduced historical pre-eradication tick distributions. Present-day predictions, although constrained to areas near the TEQA, extrapolated well onto climate projections for 2050. Conclusions: Our models indicate the potential for range expansion of climate suitable for survival of R. microplus and R. annulatus in the southern United States by mid-century, which increases the risk of reintroduction of these ticks and cattle tick fever into major cattle producing areas. {\textcopyright} 2014Giles et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim The presence-only data stored in natural history collections is the most important source of information available regarding the distribution of organisms. These data and profile techniques can be used to generate species distribution models (SDMs), but pseudo-absences must be generated to use group discriminative techniques. In this study, we evaluated whether the SDMs generated with pseudo-absences are reliable and also if there are differences in the results obtained with profile and group discriminative techniques. Location Ecuador, South America. Methods The SDMs were generated with a training data set for each of the five species of Anthurium and six different methods: two profile techniques (BIOCLIM and Gower's distance index), three group discriminative techniques [logistic multiple regression (LMR), multivariate adaptative regression splines (MARS) and Maxent] and a mixed modelling approach genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP), which employs a combination of profile and group discriminative techniques and generates its own pseudo-absences. For LMR, MARS and Maxent, three types of absences were generated: (1) random pseudo-absences in equal number to presences and excluding a buffer area around presences (except for Maxent, which assumes that this background sample includes presences), (2) a large number (10,000) of random pseudo-absences, also excluding a buffer area around each presence and (3) 'target-group absences' (TGA), consisting of sites where other species of the group have been collected by the specialist, but not the species being modelled. To compare the predictive performance of the SDMs, the area under the curve statistic was calculated using an independent testing data set for each species. Results MARS, Maxent and LMR produce better results than the profile techniques. The models created with TGA are generally more accurate than those generated with pseudo-absences. Main conclusions The advantages and disadvantages of different options for using pseudo-absences and TGA with profile and group discriminative modelling techniques are explained and recommendations are made for the future. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

This plant is an invasive weed becoming naturalized over a wide range of the world, and has caused agricultural damage mainly due to its toxicity to livestock. In Japan, fireweed was first found in 1976, and has been spreading throughout the country. In this study, the current distribution of fireweed in Japan was investigated. Using a maximum entropy ecological niche modeling algorithm, the relationship between the distribution records of fireweed and climatic variables was modeled, and the potential distribution of fireweed was predicted. Many growing sites of fireweed have been observed on the Pacific coast and Seto Inland Sea coast. The northern and southern ends of the current distribution were the Pacific coast of southern Tohoku (36.9172°N, 140.8613°E) and southern Kyushu (31.5654°N, 130.3438°E), respectively. The results of modeling showed that mean temperature in the warmest quarter was the most influential predictor, and suggested that geographical distribution of fireweed in Japan is restricted mainly by temperature, not by precipitation. The predicted areas of potential distribution were mainly on the Pacific coast and eastern Seto Inland Sea coast. Of the regions where fireweed had not been found, the following regions were predicted as potential distribution areas of fireweed: southern Kanto region along Tokyo Bay, coastal area of western Tokai region, western part of Seto Inland Sea coast and northern Kyushu. The Pacific coast of central Tohoku (39.058°N, 141.843°E) was predicted as the northern end of the potential distribution, and Amami-oshima Island (28.304°N, 129.519°E) as the southern end. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author.

The model was developed using 16 locality data in the native range of Khasi hills, and 16 environmental parameters including enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and digital elevation data. The model predicted that the suitable habitats of I. khasiana was restricted to an area of ≈500km 2 in the Khasi hills of Meghalaya. The distribution of potential habitats was strongly influenced by elevation and the EVI layers for the period April-May, which corresponds to the flowering phase of the species, thus indicating the importance of flowering stage in determining the species distribution. Population status was positively correlated with higher model thresholds in the undisturbed habitats confirming the usefulness of the habitat model in population monitoring, particularly in predicting the successful establishment of the species.

abstract = {Understanding the factors that contribute to population genetic structures and ecological niche divergence is crucial for elucidating the biogeographical history and speciation of plants. To disentangle the present phylogeographical patterns and evolutionary history of two closely related parapatric species from Ephedra (Ephedra sinica and E. intermedia), we systematically profiled their population genetic structures, niche divergence and potential speciation processes based on sequence variation of four chloroplast DNA fragments and climate-based ecological niche modelling (ENM). Phylogenetic analyses suggested that E. sinica formed a monophyly which was nested in E. intermedia. The latter species formed two paraphyletic subclades, corresponding to Western and Eastern lineages. Furthermore, the phylogeographical analysis results indicated very significant inter- and intra-species genetic differentiation, and BEAST inference suggested that E. sinica diverged from E. intermedia at 3.20 million years ago (Ma; 95 {\%} HPD: 2.05–8.10 Ma), while the Western lineage of E. intermedia diverged much earlier at 6.10 Ma (95 {\%} HPD: 4.10–11.82 Ma). In addition, niche identity tests performed using MaxEnt strongly supported the hypothesis that the two sister species had significantly diverged on their ecological niches. Isolation by geographical and environment distance (IBD and IBE) tests suggested that the overall divergence of the populations from the two species were more influenced by environmental factors. Our data provide new insight into the ecological speciation of Ephedra and also provides molecular evidence for the identification and genetic conservation of these important pharmaceutical plants. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

They usually occupy different habitats (e.g. shallow versus deep water) at a local scale, while occurring in the same broad regions at a large scale. The present study assesses the extent to which the habitat partitioning observed at local scales extends to niche partitioning at the global scale. Species distribution models (SDMs, using MaxEnt) were used to model the potential distributions of both species based on a set of environmental and dispersal related predictors. According to environmental SDMs calibrated with bioclimatic, geographic and geological factors, only 75{\%} of the predicted quagga mussel distribution overlaps with the distribution of zebra mussel, demonstrating that the niches of the two species are moderately different at a global scale. Quagga mussels were found to occur at higher average temperature and lower average precipitation, leading to the prediction that their niche includes Mediterranean and arid regions such as California and southern Spain, two areas currently unaffected by zebra mussel. A second set of SDMs illustrated a notable influence of dispersal-related factors (e.g. human population density, closeness to commercial ports and reservoirs), on quagga mussel distribution. These models suggest that the distribution of quagga mussel is more constrained by dispersal-related factors than is the distribution of zebra mussel. Evidence suggests that economic and environmental impacts can differ between the two species; joint accurate predictions may therefore prove important for targeting precautionary management plans at the right species. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Climate change is affecting many freshwater species, particularly fishes. Predictions of future climate change suggest large and deleterious effects on species with narrow dispersal abilities due to limited hydrological connectivity. In turn, this creates the potential for population isolation in thermally unsuitable habitats, leading to physiological stress, species declines or possible extirpation. The current extent of many freshwater fish species' spatio-temporal distribution patterns and their sensitivity to thermal impacts from climate change − critical information for conservation planning − are often unknown. Carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus) is an ecologically important species listed as threatened or imperilled nationally (Canada) and regionally (South Dakota, United States) due to its restricted range and sensitivity to water quality and temperature. This research aimed to determine the current distribution and spatio-temporal variability in projected suitable habitat for Carmine shiner using niche-based modeling approaches (MaxEnt, BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN models). Statistically downscaled, bias-corrected Global Circulation Models (GCMs) data was used to model the distribution of Carmine shiner in central North America for the period of 2041–2060 (2050s). Maximum mean July temperature and temperature variability were the main factors in determining Carmine shiner distribution. Patterns of projected habitat change by the 2050s suggest the spatial extent of the current distribution of Carmine shiner would shift north, with {\textgreater} 50{\%} of the current distribution changing with future projections based on two Representative Concentrations Pathways for CO2 emissions. Whereas the southern extent of the distribution would become unsuitable for Carmine shiner, suitable habitats are predicted to become available further north, if accessible. Importantly, the majority of habitat gains for Carmine shiner would be in areas currently inaccessible due to dispersal limitations, suggesting current populations may face an extinction debt within the next half century. These results provide evidence that Carmine shiner may be highly vulnerable to a warming climate and suggest that management actions - such as assisted migration - may be needed to mitigate impacts from climate change and ensure the long-term persistence of the species. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Unfortunately, scientific data regarding the actual status of populations is lacking. We combined satellite image analysis, species-specific habitat assessment, and a field survey technique using playback to focus conservation efforts for this species. First, we identified remaining forest via a LANDSAT mosaic and then applied species-specific criteria to delineate remaining forest with potential to hold populations. By combining this with the historical distribution from ecological niche modeling and predicted hunting intensity we generated a species-specific landscape map. Within our study area, forest capable of sustaining Ateles fusciceps covers 5872 km2, of which 2172 km2 (40{\%}) is protected. Unprotected forest considered suitable for Ateles fusciceps extends to 3700 km2 but within this only 989 km2 (23{\%}) is under low hunting pressure and likely to maintain healthy populations of Ateles fusciceps. To overcome problems of sampling at low primate density and in difficult mountain terrain we developed a field survey technique to determine presence and estimate abundance using acoustic sampling. For sites under low hunting pressure density of primates varied with altitude. Densities decreased from 7.49 individuals/km2 at 332 masl to 0.9 individuals/km2 at 1570 masl. Based on combining data sets in a gap analysis, we recommend conservation action focus on unprotected lowland forest to the south and west of the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve where hunting pressure is low and population densities of Ateles fusciceps are greatest. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Predicting the current and potential distributions of established invasive species is critical for evaluating management options, but methods for differentiating these distributions have received little attention. In particular, there is uncertainty among invasive species managers about the value of information from incidental sightings compared to data from designed field surveys. This study compares the two approaches, and develops a unifying framework, using the case of invasive sambar deer Cervus unicolor in Victoria, Australia. 2.We first used 391 incidental sightings of sambar deer and 12 biophysical variables to construct a presence-only habitat suitability model using Maxent. We then used that model to stratify field sampling, with proportionately greater sampling of cells with high predicted habitat suitability. Field sampling, consisting of faecal pellet surveys, sign surveys and camera trapping, was conducted in 80 4-km2 grid cells. A Bayesian state-space occupancy model was used to predict probability of suitable habitat from the field data. 3.The Maxent and occupancy models predicted similar spatial distributions of habitat suitability for sambar deer in Victoria and there was a strong positive correlation between the rankings of cells by the two approaches. The congruence of the two models suggests that any spatial and detection biases in the presence-only data were relatively unimportant in our study. 4.We predicted the extent of suitable habitat from the occupancy model using a threshold that gave a false negative error rate of 0.05. The current distribution was the suitable habitat within a kernel that had a 99.5{\%} chance of including the presence locations pooled from incidental sightings and field surveys: the potential distribution was suitable habitat outside that kernel. Several discrete areas of potential distribution were identified as priorities for surveillance monitoring with the aim of detecting and managing incursions of sambar deer. 5.Synthesis and applications.Our framework enables managers to robustly estimate the current and potential distributions of established invasive species using either presence-only and/or presence-absence data. Managers can then focus control and/or containment actions within the current distribution and establish surveillance monitoring to detect incursions within the potential distribution. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Context: Managers are faced with numerous methods for delineating wildlife movement corridors, and often must make decisions with limited data. Delineated corridors should be robust to different data and models. Objectives: We present a multi-method approach for delineating and validating wildlife corridors using multiple data sources, which can be used conserve landscape connectivity. We used this approach to delineate and validate migration corridors for wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) in the Tarangire Ecosystem of northern Tanzania. Methods: We used two types of locational data (distance sampling detections and GPS collar locations), and three modeling methods (negative binomial regression, logistic regression, and Maxent), to generate resource selection functions (RSFs) and define resistance surfaces. We compared two corridor detection algorithms (cost-distance and circuit theory), to delineate corridors. We validated corridors by comparing random and wildebeest locations that fell within corridors, and cross-validated by data type. Results: Both data types produced similar RSFs. Wildebeest consistently selected migration habitat in flatter terrain farther from human settlements. Validation indicated three of the combinations of data type, modeling, and corridor detection algorithms (detection data with Maxent modeling, GPS collar data with logistic regression modeling, and GPS collar data with Maxent modeling, all using cost-distance) far outperformed the other seven. We merged the predictive corridors from these three data-method combinations to reveal habitat with highest probability of use. Conclusions: The use of multiple methods ensures that planning is able to prioritize conservation of migration corridors based on all available information. {\textcopyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht},

abstract = {Aim: Intercomparison of mechanistic and empirical models is an important step towards improving projections of potential species distribution and abundance. We aim to compare suitability and productivity estimates for a well-understood crop species to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of mechanistic versus empirical modelling. Location: South Africa. Methods: We compared four habitat suitability models for dryland maize based on climate and soil predictors. Two were created using maximum entropy (MAXENT), the first based on national crop distribution points and the second based only on locations with high productivity. The third approach used a generalized additive model (GAM) trained with continuous productivity data derived from the satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The fourth model was a mechanistic crop growth model (DSSAT) made spatially explicit. We tested model accuracy by comparing the results with observed productivity derived from MODIS NDVI and with observed suitability based on the current spatial distribution of maize crop fields. Results: The GAM and DSSAT results were linearly correlated to NDVI-measured yield (R2 = 0.75 and 0.37, respectively). MAXENT suitability values were not linearly related to yield (R2 = 0.08); however, a MAXENT model based on occurrences of high-productivity maize was linearly related to yield (R2 = 0.62). All models produced crop suitability maps of similarly good accuracy (Kappa = 0.73-75). Main conclusions: These findings suggest that empirical models can achieve the same or better accuracy as mechanistic models for predicting both suitability (i.e. species range) and productivity (i.e. species abundance). While MAXENT could not predict productivity across the species range when trained on all occurrences, it could when trained with a high-productivity subset, suggesting that ecological niche models can be adjusted to better correlate with species abundance. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new approach for the evaluation of the probability density function (pdf) of a random variable from the knowledge of its lower moments is presented. At first the classical moment problem (MP) is revisited, which gives the conditions such that the assigned sequence of sample moments represent really a sequence of moments of any distribution. Then an alternative approach is presented, termed as the kernel density maximum entropy (MaxEnt) method by the authors, which approximates the target pdf as a convex linear combination of kernel densities, transforming the original MP into a discrete MP, which is solved through a MaxEnt approach. In this way, simply solving a discrete MaxEnt problem, not requiring the evaluation of numerical integrals, an approximating pdf converging toward the MaxEnt pdf is obtained. The method is first demonstrated by approximating some known analytical pdfs (the chi-square and the Gumbel pdfs) and then it is applied to some experimental engineering problems, namely for modelling the pdf of concrete strength, the circular frequency and the damping ratio of strong ground motions, the extreme wind speed in Messina's Strait region. All the developed numerical applications show the goodness and efficacy of the proposed procedure. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Current presence records for these species were gathered, and potential distribution models were built using Maximum Entropy niche modeling (MaxEnt). Model suitability surfaces were used to calculate remaining potential habitat areas in the region, as well as the potential sympatric area and representation of these areas in Natural Protected Areas. Biological and anthropogenic variables were the best species distribution predictors. Landscape composition (the proportion of different land-use and land-cover classes: forest, agriculture, and pasture) within approximately 120 ha, was the most important variable for all models, influencing each species differently with respect to their tolerance of altered habitats. The remaining potential area of all three species is fragmented and has apparently been nearly lost in plains ({\textless}14{\%} remaining). Distribution models allowed us to detect an important location in the western portion of our study area which may function as a large biological corridor in the Sierra Madre Oriental mastogeographic province, a region heavily transformed by land use change. In the context of habitat transformation, management promoting quality matrix at the landscape level promises to be a viable alternative for ungulate conservation in tropical regions of Mexico.},

abstract = {Can we model the potential habitat of natural regeneration of Mediterranean woody species in forest plantations using distribution models? In this paper, dasometric variables from a forest inventory of Sierra de Baza Natural Park, combined with environmental variables (climatic, topographic) and biotic variables were analyzed to assess which factors influence the regeneration of seven woody species (Pinus sylvestris, P. nigra, P. pinaster, P. halepensis, Quercus ilex, Crataegus monogyna and Acer opalus). Modeling potential habitat for regeneration was done using Maxent in the current climate, and two future climate scenarios. The combination of biotic and climatic variables was important to predict regeneration of Pinus species, A. opalus subsp. granatense and C. monogyna, while the regeneration of Q. ilex was more related to climate predictors. In future climate change scenarios, P. halepensis optimum regeneration habitat could increase significantly, whereas the remaining species tend to moderate decreases (25{\%}) for the period 2000-2050. Our results highlight the importance of species distribution models as a useful tool for achieving greater naturalization of forest plantations by identifying areas of future climatic optimum distribution. We further demonstrate the potential of forest inventory data to monitor changes in regeneration and prioritize restoration actions to facilitate regeneration. {\textcopyright} 2016 Los Autores.

abstract = {Background: The Middle East North Africa (MENA) region is under continuous threat of the re-emergence of West Nile virus (WNV) and Rift Valley Fever virus (RVF), two pathogens transmitted by the vector species Culex pipiens. Predicting areas at high risk for disease transmission requires an accurate model of vector distribution, however, most Cx. pipiens distribution modeling has been confined to temperate, forested habitats. Modeling species distributions across a heterogeneous landscape structure requires a flexible modeling method to capture variation in mosquito response to predictors as well as occurrence data points taken from a sufficient range of habitat types. Methods. We used presence-only data from Egypt and Lebanon to model the population distribution of Cx. pipiens across a portion of the MENA that also encompasses Jordan, Syria, and Israel. Models were created with a set of environmental predictors including bioclimatic data, human population density, hydrological data, and vegetation indices, and built using maximum entropy (Maxent) and boosted regression tree (BRT) methods. Models were created with and without the inclusion of human population density. Results: Predictions of Maxent and BRT models were strongly correlated in habitats with high probability of occurrence (Pearson's r = 0.774, r = 0.734), and more moderately correlated when predicting into regions that exceeded the range of the training data (r = 0.666,r = 0.558). All models agreed in predicting high probability of occupancy around major urban areas, along the banks of the Nile, the valleys of Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan, and southwestern Saudi Arabia. The most powerful predictors of Cx. pipiens habitat were human population density (60.6{\%} Maxent models, 34.9{\%} BRT models) and the seasonality of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) (44.7{\%} Maxent, 16.3{\%} BRT). Maxent models tended to be dominated by a single predictor. Areas of high probability corresponded with sites of independent surveys or previous disease outbreaks. Conclusions: Cx. pipiens occurrence was positively associated with areas of high human population density and consistent vegetation cover, but was not significantly driven by temperature and rainfall, suggesting human-induced habitat change such as irrigation and urban infrastructure has a greater influence on vector distribution in this region than in temperate zones. {\textcopyright} 2014 Conley et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Concern over bycatch of protected species has become a key factor in shaping fisheries management decisions. In 2001, the National Marine Fisheries Service established an annual closure of a large mesh drift gillnet fishery targeting swordfish from central Oregon to central California between August 15 and November 15 because of concerns of bycatch of endangered leatherback turtles (the Pacific Leatherback Conservation Area, PLCA). The spatio-temporal constraints of the PLCA were developed to encompass nearly all previously observed leatherback turtle bycatch events in the fishery. The PLCA has been effective at reducing bycatch of leatherback turtles but has reduced fishing opportunities. In this study, we examined whether the timing of the current PLCA closure is optimal for leatherback turtle conservation, by developing statistical models of leatherback turtle presence inside the PLCA based on environmental variables. We also examined finer-scale spatiotemporal patterns of potential overlap between the fishery and leatherback turtle foraging habitat using Maxent and Random Forests applied to logbook data and leatherback turtle telemetry data. Our results suggest that the temporal extent of the current static closure period is the shortest and most effective for protecting the turtles while allowing fishing during low bycatch-risk periods. We also found that it is possible to predict foraging habitat of leatherback turtles and fishing effort using environmental variables. Identification of spatial and temporal hotspots of potential overlap between fishing effort and leatherback turtle distribution can form a basis for dynamic management approaches. Published 2016.

We test the hypothesis that major fronts in the region (Tasman Front, Subtropical Convergence, Subantarctic Front) represent zoogeographic boundaries. A four-region zoogeographic scheme is hypothesised: Coral Sea region, Subtropical Lower Water region, Subtropical Convergence/South Tasman region and Subantarctic region. The Tasman Front, Subtropical Convergence and Subantarctic Front represented zoogeographic boundaries. An additional boundary at ∼25°S (coined the 'Capricorn' boundary) was adopted to delineate the Coral Sea from Subtropical Lower Water regions. Lanternfish zoogeographic regions are congruent with some aspects of two prevailing physicochemical biogeographic schema in the region, but neither of these schema alone accurately predicts lanternfish distributions. As lanternfishes integrate vertical ocean processes, the hypothesised lanternfish zoogeography may represent a useful model for a generalised pelagic biogeography that should be tested for other oceanic groups. {\textcopyright} 2013 Flynn, Marshall.},

Culex tritaeniorhynchus is the primary vector of the JE virus, while wading birds are natural reservoirs and swine amplifying hosts. As part of a JE risk analysis, the ecological niche modeling programme, Maxent, was used to develop a predictive model for the distribution of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus in the Republic of Korea, using mosquito collection data, temperature, precipitation, elevation, land cover and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The resulting probability maps from the model were consistent with the known environmental limitations of the mosquito with low probabilities predicted for forest covered mountains. July minimum temperature and land cover were the most important variables in the model. Elevation, summer NDVI (July-September), precipitation in July, summer minimum temperature (May-August) and maximum temperature for fall and winter months also contributed to the model. Comparison of the Cx. tritaeniorhynchus model to the distribution of JE cases in the Republic of Korea from 2001 to 2009 showed that cases among a highly vaccinated Korean population were located in high-probability areas for Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. No recent JE cases were reported from the eastern coastline, where higher probabilities of mosquitoes were predicted, but where only small numbers of pigs are raised. The geographical distribution of reported JE cases corresponded closely with the predicted high-probability areas for Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, making the map a useful tool for health risk analysis that could be used for planning preventive public health measures.},

Results: Models of plague activity in California ground squirrels, based on recent climate conditions, accurately identified case locations (AUC of 0.913 to 0.948) and were significantly correlated with coyote samples. The final models were used to identify potential plague risk areas based on an ensemble of six future climate scenarios. These models suggest that by 2050, climate conditions may reduce plague risk in the southern parts of California and increase risk along the northern coast and Sierras. Conclusion: Because different modeling approaches can yield substantially different results, care should be taken when interpreting future model predictions. Nonetheless, niche modeling can be a useful tool for exploring and mapping the potential response of plague activity to climate change. The final models in this study were used to identify potential plague risk areas based on an ensemble of six future climate scenarios, which can help public managers decide where to allocate surveillance resources. In addition, Maxent model results were significantly correlated with coyote samples, indicating that carnivore surveillance programs will continue to be important for tracking the response of plague to future climate conditions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Holt et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Early detection of invasive plant species is vital for the management of natural resources and protection of ecosystem processes. The use of satellite remote sensing for mapping the distribution of invasive plants is becoming more common, however conventional imaging software and classification methods have been shown to be unreliable. In this study, we test and evaluate the use of five species distribution model techniques fit with satellite remote sensing data to map invasive tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) along the Arkansas River in Southeastern Colorado. The models tested included boosted regression trees (BRT), Random Forest (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), generalized linear model (GLM), and Maxent. These analyses were conducted using a newly developed software package called the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM). All models were trained with 499 presence points, 10,000 pseudo-absence points, and predictor variables acquired from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor over an eight-month period to distinguish tamarisk from native riparian vegetation using detection of phenological differences. From the Landsat scenes, we used individual bands and calculated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and tasseled capped transformations. All five models identified current tamarisk distribution on the landscape successfully based on threshold independent and threshold dependent evaluation metrics with independent location data. To account for model specific differences, we produced an ensemble of all five models with map output highlighting areas of agreement and areas of uncertainty. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of species distribution models in analyzing remotely sensed data and the utility of ensemble mapping, and showcase the capability of SAHM in pre-processing and executing multiple complex models. {\textcopyright} 2016 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.},

The range and population of this species have been significantly reduced through multiple anthropogenic impacts. Classified as vulnerable, the ngwayir is highly susceptible to extremes of temperature and reduced water intake. Ngwayir distribution was determined using three different species distribution models using ngwayir presence records related to a set of 19 bioclimatic variables derived from historical climate data, overlaid with 2050 climate change scenarios. MaxEnt was used to identify core habitat and demonstrate how this habitat may be impacted. A supplementary modelling exercise was also conducted to ascertain potential impacts on the tree species that are core habitat for ngwayir. All models predicted a reduction of up to 60{\%} in the range of the ngwayir and its habitat, as a result of global warming towards the south-west of the project area, with a mean potential distribution of 10.3{\%} of the total modelled area of 561 059 km2. All three tree species modelled (jarrah, marri and peppermint) were predicted to experience similar contractions in range throughout most of the predicted ngwayir range, although their distributions differed. Populations of ngwayir persisting outside core habitat may indicate potential conservation opportunities. {\textcopyright} Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2013.},

abstract = {Despite widespread recognition that social-value information is needed to inform stakeholders and decision makers regarding trade-offs in environmental management, it too often remains absent from ecosystem service assessments. Although quantitative indicators of social values need to be explicitly accounted for in the decision-making process, they need not be monetary. Ongoing efforts to map such values demonstrate how they can also be made spatially explicit and relatable to underlying ecological information. We originally developed Social Values for Ecosystem Services (SolVES) as a tool to assess, map, and quantify nonmarket values perceived by various groups of ecosystem stakeholders. With SolVES 2.0 we have extended the functionality by integrating SolVES with Maxent maximum entropy modeling software to generate more complete social-value maps from available value and preference survey data and to produce more robust models describing the relationship between social values and ecosystems. The current study has two objectives: (1) evaluate how effectively the value index, a quantitative, nonmonetary social-value indicator calculated by SolVES, reproduces results from more common statistical methods of social-survey data analysis and (2) examine how the spatial results produced by SolVES provide additional information that could be used by managers and stakeholders to better understand more complex relationships among stakeholder values, attitudes, and preferences. To achieve these objectives, we applied SolVES to value and preference survey data collected for three national forests, the Pike and San Isabel in Colorado and the Bridger-Teton and the Shoshone in Wyoming. Value index results were generally consistent with results found through more common statistical analyses of the survey data such as frequency, discriminant function, and correlation analyses. In addition, spatial analysis of the social-value maps produced by SolVES provided information that was useful for explaining relationships between stakeholder values and forest uses. Our results suggest that SolVES can effectively reproduce information derived from traditional statistical analyses while adding spatially explicit, social-value information that can contribute to integrated resource assessment, planning, and management of forests and other ecosystems. {\textcopyright} Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Algorithms for producing ecological niche models and species distribution models are widely applied in biogeography and conservation biology. However, in some cases models produced by these algorithms may not represent optimal levels of complexity and, hence, likely either overestimate or underestimate the species' ecological tolerances. Here, we evaluate a delete-one jackknife approach for tuning model settings to approximate optimal model complexity and enhance predictions for datasets with few (here, {\textless}10) occurrence records. We apply this approach to tune two settings that regulate model complexity (feature class and regularization multiplier) in the presence-background modeling program Maxent for two species of spiny pocket mice in Ecuador and southwestern Colombia. For these datasets, we identified an optimal feature class parameter that is more complex than the default. Highly complex features are not typically recommended for use with small sample sizes in Maxent. However, when coupled with higher regularization, complex features (that allow more flexible responses to environmental variables) can obtain models that out-perform those built using default settings (employing less complex feature classes). Although small sample sizes remain a serious limitation to model building, this jackknife optimization approach can be used for species with few localities ({\textless}approximately 20-25) to produce models that maximize the utility of the little information available. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aim Globally, species distribution patterns in the deep sea are poorly resolved, with spatial coverage being sparse for most taxa and true absence data missing. Increasing human impacts on deep-sea ecosystems mean that reaching a better understanding of such patterns is becoming more urgent. Cold-water stony corals (Order Scleractinia) form structurally complex habitats (dense thickets or reefs) that can support a diversity of other associated fauna. Despite their widely accepted ecological importance, records of scleractinian corals on seamounts are patchy and simply not available for most of the global ocean. The objective of this paper is to model the global distribution of suitable habitat for stony corals on seamounts. Location Seamounts worldwide. Methods We compiled a database containing all accessible records of scleractinian corals on seamounts. Two modelling approaches developed for presence-only data were used to predict global habitat suitability for seamount scleractinians: maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) and environmental niche factor analysis (ENFA). We generated habitat-suitability maps and used a cross-validation process with a threshold-independent metric to evaluate the performance of the models. Results Both models performed well in cross-validation, although the Maxent method consistently outperformed ENFA. Highly suitable habitat for seamount stony corals was predicted to occur at most modelled depths in the North Atlantic, and in a circumglobal strip in the Southern Hemisphere between 20° and 50° S and shallower than around 1500 m. Seamount summits in most other regions appeared much less likely to provide suitable habitat, except for small near-surface patches. The patterns of habitat suitability largely reflect current biogeographical knowledge. Environmental variables positively associated with high predicted habitat suitability included the aragonite saturation state, and oxygen saturation and concentration. By contrast, low levels of dissolved inorganic carbon, nitrate, phosphate and silicate were associated with high predicted suitability. High correlation among variables made assessing individual drivers difficult. Main conclusions Our models predict environmental conditions likely to play a role in determining large-scale scleractinian coral distributions on seamounts, and provide a baseline scenario on a global scale. These results present a first-order hypothesis that can be tested by further sampling. Given the high vulnerability of cold-water corals to human impacts, such predictions are crucial tools in developing worldwide conservation and management strategies for seamount ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are broadly used in ecological and evolutionary studies. Almost all SDM methods require extensive data preparation in a geographic information system (GIS) prior to model building. Often, this step is cumbersome and, if not properly done, can lead to poorly parameterized models or in some cases, if too difficult, prevents the realization of SDMs. Further, for many studies, the creation of SDMs is not the final result and the post-modelling processing can be equally arduous as other steps. SDMtoolbox is designed to facilitate many complicated pre- and post-processing steps commonly required for species distribution modelling and other geospatial analyses. SDMtoolbox consists of 59 Python script-based GIS tools developed and compiled into a single interface. A large set of the tools were created to complement SDMs generated in Maxent or to improve the predictive performance of SDMs created in Maxent. However, SDMtoolbox is not limited to analyses of Maxent models, and many tools are also available for additional analyses or general geospatial processing: for example, assessing landscape connectivity of haplotype networks (using least-cost corridors or least-cost paths); correcting SDM over-prediction; quantifying distributional changes between current and future SDMs; or for calculating several biodiversity metrics, such as corrected weighted endemism. SDMtoolbox is a free comprehensive python-based toolbox for macroecology, landscape genetic and evolutionary studies to be used in ArcGIS 10.1 (or higher) with the Spatial Analyst extension.

abstract = {In times of anthropogenic climate change and increasing rates of habitat loss in many areas of the world, spatially explicit predictions of species' ranges using species distribution models (SDMs) have become of central interest in conservation biology. Such predictions can be derived using species records from museum collections or field surveys combined with, for example, climate and/or land cover data stored in geographic information systems (GIS). Although much attention has been paid to the application of bioclimatic data for SDMs development, the inclusion of land cover information derived from remote sensing is still at the beginning. Herein, we tested for the first time whether SDMs can be improved by inclusion of seasonality information derived from multi-temporal remote-sensing data. We compared models computed for eight Mexican anurans using five different sets of predictors comprising either bioclimatic or remote-sensing data or combinations thereof. Our results suggested that the appropriate set of predictor variables is very much dependent on the species-specific habitat preferences and the patchiness/spatial fragmentation of the suitable habitat types. For species occupying spatially fragmented habitats, spatial predictions based on pure bioclimatic data were less detailed. On the contrary, especially for rather generalist species, SDMs using only remote-sensing data for model development tended to overpredict the species' ranges. For most species, the best strategy for SDM development was a combined model design using both climate and remote-sensing data, while the best methodology of combining the two data sets varied between species. This combined model design allowed us to incorporate the advantages of both approaches, i.e., inclusion of habitat availability using only remote-sensing data and high spatial definition by using bioclimatic variables, by avoidance of the drawbacks of each of them {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

The dynamic nature of oceanographic processes and the wide-ranging behavior of many marine vertebrates create further difficulties, as distribution data must incorporate both the spatial and temporal dimensions. Cetaceans play an essential role in structuring and maintaining marine ecosystems and face increasing threats from human activities. The Azores holds a high diversity of cetaceans but the information about spatial and temporal patterns of distribution for this marine megafauna group in the region is still very limited. To tackle this issue, we created monthly predictive cetacean distribution maps for spring and summer months, using data collected by the Azores Fisheries Observer Programme between 2004 and 2009. We then combined the individual predictive maps to obtain species richness maps for the same period. Our results reflect a great heterogeneity in distribution among species and within species among different months. This heterogeneity reflects a contrasting influence of oceanographic processes on the distribution of cetacean species. However, some persistent areas of increased species richness could also be identified from our results. We argue that policies aimed at effectively protecting cetaceans and their habitats must include the principle of dynamic ocean management coupled with other area-based management such as marine spatial planning. {\textcopyright} 2016 Tobe{\~{n}}a, Prieto, Machete and Silva.},

Bolivia is a centre of wild relative diversity for several crops, among them potato, which is an important staple worldwide and the principal food crop in this country. Despite their relevance for plant breeding, limited knowledge exists about their in situ conservation status. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and distribution modelling with the software Maxent to better understand geographic patterns of endemic wild potato diversity in Bolivia. In combination with threat layers, we assessed the conservation status of all endemic species, 21 in total. We prioritised areas for in situ conservation by using complementary reserve selection and excluded 25{\%} of the most-threatened collection sites because costs to implement conservation measures at those locations may be too high compared to other areas. Some 70{\%} (15 of 21 species) has a preliminary vulnerable status or worse according to IUCN red list distribution criteria. Our results show that four of these species would require special conservation attention because they were only observed in {\textless}15 locations and are highly threatened by human accessibility, fires and livestock pressure. Although highest species richness occurs in south-central Bolivia, in the departments Santa Cruz and Chuquisaca, the first priority area for in situ conservation according to our reserve selection exercise is central Bolivia, Cochabamba; this area is less threatened than the potato wild relatives' hotspot in south-central Bolivia. Only seven of the 21 species were observed in protected areas. To improve coverage of potato wild relatives' distribution by protected areas, we recommend starting inventories in parks and reserves with high modelled diversity.

abstract = {When species distribution models (SDMs) are used to predict how a species will respond to environmental change, an important assumption is that the environmental niche of the species is conserved over evolutionary time-scales. Empirical studies conducted at ecological time-scales, however, demonstrate that the niche of some species can vary in response to environmental change. We use habitat and locality data of five species of stream fishes collected across seasons to examine the effects of niche variability on the accuracy of projections from Maxent, a popular SDM. We then compare these predictions to those from an alternate method of creating SDM projections in which a transformation of the environmental data to similar scales is applied. The niche of each species varied to some degree in response to seasonal variation in environmental variables, with most species shifting habitat use in response to changes in canopy cover or flow rate. SDMs constructed from the original environmental data accurately predicted the occurrences of one species across all seasons and a subset of seasons for two other species. A similar result was found for SDMs constructed from the transformed environmental data. However, the transformed SDMs produced better models in ten of the 14 total SDMs, as judged by ratios of mean probability values at known presences to mean probability values at all other locations. Niche variability should be an important consideration when using SDMs to predict future distributions of species because of its prevalence among natural populations. The framework we present here may potentially improve these predictions by accounting for such variability. Copyright: {\textcopyright} 2012 Michel, Knouft.},

Our approach is based on the concept of machine learning, wherein the MaxEnt parametric model is used for supervised classification and prediction serving as the central (global) decision rule. Therefore, the system is able to learn the detection performance of the sensors as a function of time without prior knowledge of the actual probabilities of local decisions, only requiring an initial set of random training data. Thus it is demonstrated that the system is adaptive and can learn contextual changes of the sensors.

Whale shark aggregations have been documented in large numbers in the NGOM since 2003, and species distribution models provide a unique approach to analyzing these presence data. We used maximum entropy and ecological niche factor analysis, 2 algorithms designed for predicting spe cies distribution based only on presence data, to analyze data for the summer period in 2008 and 2009. Cohen's kappa (kappa) and the 'area under the receiver operating characteristic curve' (AUC) were used to evaluate model performance with an external testing dataset. Kappa values ranged from 0.28 to 0.69, and AUC values ranged from 0.73 to 0.80, indicating that the predicted distribution had a fair to substantial agreement with the testing data. Distance to continental shelf edge, distance to adjacent petroleum platforms, and chlorophyll a were the variables most strongly related to whale shark sightings, likely due to an association of these variables with high food availability. Suitable habitat was predicted along the continental shelf edge, with the most suitable habitat predicted south of the Mississippi River Delta. The spatial distribution of suitable habitat is dynamic; therefore, a multi-year study is underway to better delineate temporal trends in regional whale shark distribution and to identify consistent areas of high suitability. Presenceonly habitat models are a powerful tool for delineating important regional habitat for a vulnerable, highly migratory species. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract = {The extensive spatial and temporal coverage of many citizen science datasets (CSD) makes them appealing for use in species distribution modeling and forecasting. However, a frequent limitation is the inability to validate results. Here, we aim to assess the reliability of CSD for forecasting species occurrence in response to national forest management projections (representing 160,366 km2) by comparison against forecasts from a model based on systematically collected colonization–extinction data. We fitted species distribution models using citizen science observations of an old-forest indicator fungus Phellinus ferrugineofuscus. We applied five modeling approaches (generalized linear model, Poisson process model, Bayesian occupancy model, and two MaxEnt models). Models were used to forecast changes in occurrence in response to national forest management for 2020-2110. Forecasts of species occurrence from models based on CSD were congruent with forecasts made using the colonization–extinction model based on systematically collected data, although different modeling methods indicated different levels of change. All models projected increased occurrence in set-aside forest from 2020 to 2110: the projected increase varied between 125{\%} and 195{\%} among models based on CSD, in comparison with an increase of 129{\%} according to the colonization–extinction model. All but one model based on CSD projected a decline in production forest, which varied between 11{\%} and 49{\%}, compared to a decline of 41{\%} using the colonization–extinction model. All models thus highlighted the importance of protected old forest for P. ferrugineofuscus persistence. We conclude that models based on CSD can reproduce forecasts from models based on systematically collected colonization–extinction data and so lead to the same forest management conclusions. Our results show that the use of a suite of models allows CSD to be reliably applied to land management and conservation decision making, demonstrating that widely available CSD can be a valuable forecasting resource. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

abstract = {Understanding the spatial pattern of species distributions is fundamental in biogeography, and conservation and resource management applications. Most species distribution models (SDMs) require or prefer species presence and absence data for adequate estimation of model parameters. However, observations with unreliable or unreported species absences dominate and limit the implementation of SDMs. Presence-only models generally yield less accurate predictions of species distribution, and make it difficult to incorporate spatial autocorrelation. The availability of large amounts of historical presence records for freshwater fishes of the United States provides an opportunity for deriving reliable absences from data reported as presence-only, when sampling was predominantly community-based. In this study, we used boosted regression trees (BRT), logistic regression, and MaxEnt models to assess the performance of a historical metacommunity database with inferred absences, for modeling fish distributions, investigating the effect of model choice and data properties thereby. With models of the distribution of 76 native, non-game fish species of varied traits and rarity attributes in four river basins across the United States, we show that model accuracy depends on data quality (e.g., sample size, location precision), species' rarity, statistical modeling technique, and consideration of spatial autocorrelation. The cross-validation area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) tended to be high in the spatial presence-absence models at the highest level of resolution for species with large geographic ranges and small local populations. Prevalence affected training but not validation AUC. The key habitat predictors identified and the fish-habitat relationships evaluated through partial dependence plots corroborated most previous studies. The community-based SDM framework broadens our capability to model species distributions by innovatively removing the constraint of lack of species absence data, thus providing a robust prediction of distribution for stream fishes in other regions where historical data exist, and for other taxa (e.g., benthic macroinvertebrates, birds) usually observed by community-based sampling designs. {\textcopyright} 2015 Huang, Frimpong.

Dareh Anjir wildlife refuge in central Iran is one of the best and the most secure habitats for this species. This study used the MAXENT method to study data from 2011 to 2013 to determine the suitability of habitat and specify factors affecting the presence of cheetahs. Environmental variables used in modeling were: height layers, slope, prey distribution (Gazella bennettii, Ovis orientalis, Capra aegagrus), distance to water resources, vegetation, distance to villages, distance to roads (asphalt, unpaved), distance to mines, and distance to railways. The results show that the most important factor affecting the presence of the cheetah is distance-to-water-resources. The parameters of prey distribution and level of vegetation were identified as the most effective factors for determining a plan to preserve and predict desirable areas for the presence of cheetahs. These predictions indicate that central and southeastern portions of Dareh Anjir wildlife refuge are the most suitable for the cheetah.

abstract = {Aim: Ecological niche modelling is being widely applied to help us understand the geographic distributions of species, despite challenges regarding the estimation of fundamental niches that limit model transferability over time and space. Mechanistic models are an alternative, but they can be difficult to implement owing to the detailed knowledge that they require about the organism for full parameterization. In this paper we explore the geographic projection of physiological measurements of optimal temperature, precipitation and relative humidity requirements, as measured under controlled conditions using a climate dataset with high temporal resolution, as a case study for Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides), and compare scaling effects with correlative niche models calibrated in Maxent. Location: The Americas. Methods: We used climate data with a high temporal resolution to understand how often and where populations of Spanish moss occur under optimal and suboptimal conditions with respect to different environmental variables across their geographic range. We used weather station data for the United States with higher spatial resolution to provide a finer-grained view. We also developed an ecological niche model to show how averaged climate data can present inaccurate views of physiological thresholds for the species. Results: Few populations of Spanish moss are located at sites that present suboptimal conditions for more than two environmental parameters. The northern distributional limit of Spanish moss is set by minimum temperature requirements, whereas maximum temperatures are less limiting. However, when the same occurrences are analysed with respect to averaged climate data, 95{\%} of populations appear to fall within the optimal physiological intervals. Main conclusions: Our analyses revealed that most populations of Spanish moss do not experience optimal ecophysiological conditions for all environmental variables, even over long time-scales. Physiological data may be of limited utility in delimiting suitable areas for populations of species, but they offer unique perspectives on the causes of range limitation. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecological conservation. SDM building generally considers climate, soil, organism, and topography. SDMs base predictions on the relationship between species and direct predictors (the first three factors). Regardless of modeling methods involved, a reliable SDM prediction depends on the quality of data. High accuracy and resolution of data may be the primary requirements for SDMs. This is especially true for soils and vegetation. Accuracy problem becomes even more crucial to models for mountainous terrain. Climate and soil data are difficult to measure, biotic data are even more difficult to collect owing to fine spatiotemporal resolution of biotic dimensions, and they tend to be inaccurate. By contrast, topographic data derived from DEM are accurate, even in mountainous terrain. It is thus not surprising that SDMs are based partially or completely on topographic variables. Even worse, it is extremely difficult to get all of the data for SDMs simultaneously. Topographic wetness index (TWI), soil-moisture surrogate, was developed. The base models and expanded models (including TWI) were built by MAXENT and Decision Tree for predicting the potential habitats of tree species in the Huisun study area. The two methods improved SDM performance, but they are not decisive in this work. Tolerance of soil-moisture deficit of species substantially affects SDM performance. TWI can help to refine predictions; however, the improvement is limited because of moderate resolution DEM being used. Accordingly, high accuracy and resolution of data play a pivotal role. SDMs should run on an iterative basis with topographic variables in initial rounds and direct predictors in later rounds after much smaller field-survey areas have been prioritized from the output of initial rounds. High-resolution DEM will be used to derive topographic variables and be incorporated in the next round of SDM iterative process.},

Methods: In this study, we used a large database of Coprophagous Scarabaeidae beetle records collected between 1970 and 1980 in continental France and the Iberian Peninsula to assess the relative performance of different modelling methods in predicting species distributions using current climate and land use information. We used maxent with standard settings and boosted regression trees with three different approaches to generate pseudo-absences. We used historical data to model species distribution and then projected the models into the present. Each method's performance was then assessed by specific field sampling conducted at 20 different sites. Results: Field validation demonstrated that model predictions were more accurate when pseudo-absence data were selected from a sampling bias grid and that model evaluations based on test datasets can lead to false conclusions if not correctly calibrated. The study also demonstrated that the method in which pseudo-absences are dealt with has a major impact on ecological conclusions.

We used presence (131) and absence (219) records of the marine angiosperm Zostera marina L. from the archipelago of SW Finland, northern Baltic Sea, to model its distribution in a 5400 km2 area. We used depth, slope, turbidity, wave exposure and distance to sandy shores as environmental predictors, and compared a presence-absence method: generalised additive model (GAM), with a presence only method: maximum entropy (Maxent). Models were validated using semi-independent data sets. Both models performed well and described the niche of Z. marina fairly consistently, although there were differences in the way the models weighted the environmental variables, and consequently the spatial predictions differed somewhat. A notable outcome from the process was that with relatively equal model performance, the area actually predicted in geographical space can vary by twofold. The area predicted as suitable for Z. marina by the ensemble was almost half of that predicted by the GAM model by itself. The ensemble of model predictions increased the model predictive capability marginally and clearly shifted the model towards a more conservative prediction, increasing specificity, but at the same time sacrificing sensitivity. The environmental predictors selected into the final models described the potential distribution of Z. marina well and showed that in the northern Baltic the species occupies a narrow niche, typically thriving in shallow and moderately exposed to exposed locations near sandy shores. We conclude that a prediction based on a combination of model results provides a more realistic estimate of the core area suitable for Z. marina and should be the modelling approach implemented in conservation planning and management. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Most early studies applying species distribution models (SDM) at large spatial scales (e.g. global, continental or regional scale) use climatic/topographic predictors only. Remotely sensed datasets are increasingly being used in local scale SDM for identifying, characterizing and predicting animal habitats at the finer scales that are more relevant for on ground biodiversity management. However, the SDMs based on remotely sensed data are rarely assessed in highly fragmented landscapes, such as floodplains. In this study, we explore the efficiency of using variables derived from time series of MODIS NDVI in models predicting three turtle distributions in the highly fragmented Murray Darling Basin (MDB), Australia. For each of the three broadly distributed turtles, namely, Macrochelodina expansa, Chelodina longicollis and Emydura macquarii, we built five sets of Maxent (maximum entropy modelling) SDMs, using a combination of the three classes of predictors (climatic, topographic, and remotely sensed). We assessed the predictive power of these models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC). In addition, we compared the models in terms of niche overlap and the landscape metrics computed from the predicted distribution maps. Our results demonstrated that the full models, which integrated all three classes of predictors, were superior to other models with significantly higher AUC values (. p{\textless}0.001), and was consistent for all three turtle species. For the best performing models, the NDVI-based predictors had a larger contribution. Comparing with models with bioclimatic/topographic variables, the models with topographic and NDVI-derived predictors had much higher niche similarity with the best model (Schoener's D was 0.95, 0.95 and 0.94 for C. longicollis, E. macquarii and M. expansa, respectively).

abstract = {In 2007 African swine fever (ASF) entered Georgia and in the same year the disease entered the Russian Federation. From 2007 to 2012 ASF spread throughout the southern region of the Russian Federation. At the same time several cases of ASF were detected in the central and northern regions of the Russian Federation, forming a northern cluster of outbreaks in 2011. This northern cluster is of concern because of its proximity to mainland Europe. The aim of this study was to use details of recorded ASF outbreaks and human and swine population details to estimate the spatial distribution of ASF risk in the southern region of the European part of the Russian Federation. Our model of ASF risk was comprised of two components. The first was an estimate of ASF suitability scores calculated using maximum entropy methods. The second was an estimate of ASF risk as a function of Euclidean distance from index cases. An exponential distribution fitted to a frequency histogram of the Euclidean distance between consecutive ASF cases had a mean value of 156 km, a distance greater than the surveillance zone radius of 100-150 km stated in the ASF control regulations for the Russian Federation. We show that the spatial and temporal risk of ASF expansion is related to the suitability of the area of potential expansion, which is in turn a function of socio-economic and geographic variables. We propose that the methodology presented in this paper provides a useful tool to optimize surveillance for ASF in affected areas. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Models of species distributions are increasingly being used to address a variety of problems in conservation biology. In many applications, perfect or constant detectability of species, given presence, is assumed. While this problem has been acknowledged and addressed through the development of occupancy models, we still know little regarding whether addressing the potential for imperfect detection improves the predictive performance of species distribution models in nature. Here, we contrast logistic regression models of species occurrence that do not correct for detectability to hierarchical occupancy models that explicitly estimate and adjust for detectability, and maximum entropy models that attempt to circumvent the detectability problem by using data from known presence locations only. We use a large-scale, long-term monitoring database across western Montana and northern Idaho to contrast these models for nine landbird species that cover a broad spectrum in detectability. Overall, occupancy models were similar to or better than other approaches in terms of predictive accuracy, as measured by the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and Kappa, with maximum entropy tending to provide the lowest predictive accuracy. Models varied in the types of errors associated with predictions, such that some model approaches may be preferred over others in certain situations. As expected, predictive performance varied across a gradient in species detectability, with logistic regression providing lower relative performance for less detectable species and Maxent providing lower performance for highly detectable species. We conclude by discussing the advantages and limitations to each approach for developing large-scale species distribution models. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Aim: Climate change threatens biodiversity in all ecosystems, and major shifts in species distributions are expected. Freshwater ecosystems are considered particularly vulnerable due to the ectothermic physiology of most freshwater species and their limited habitat extent and capacity to track climate trends. In this study, we examined what broad patterns in freshwater riverine species turnover might be expected under climate change across continental Australia and what are the implications of these patterns for aquatic species and the low aquatic biodiversity of some bioregions?. Location: Continental Australia. Methods: We built statistical relationships between bioclimatic environments and the occurrence of species of four freshwater taxa (freshwater fish, crayfish, turtles and frogs) and examined trends in projected species turnover for a ‘business as usual' climate scenario. We used Maxent to model species distributions and present the median projection across 18 global climate models. A recently derived national stream network was used to generate estimates of mean annual river flow and to produce realistic species distributions and migration options by restricting dispersal and migration opportunities usually available to riverine fauna. Results: High species turnover was driven overwhelmingly by potential local extinctions particularly for stream frogs and crayfish where their current biodiversity is largely confined to higher elevation headwater streams. We predicted high turnover for inland regions of Australia, which are arid and generally support fewer freshwater species. Main conclusions: Our analysis indicates that under the most severe emissions pathway, projected climate change is likely to cause substantial changes to the composition of faunal assemblages in Australian rivers well before the end of this century. While freshwater systems globally are subject to immediate and pressing threats from anthropogenic land and water use, management interventions addressing these pressures need to be considered within the context of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

abstract = {In 2006 the United Nations called on states to implement measures to prevent significant adverse impacts to vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) in the deep sea. It has been widely recognised that a major limitation to the effective application of these measures to date is uncertainty regarding the distribution of VMEs. Conservationists, researchers, resource managers and governmental bodies are increasingly turning to predictive species distribution models (SDMs) to identify the potential presence of species in areas that have not been sampled. In particular, the development of robust 'presence-background' model algorithms has accelerated the application of these techniques for working with presence-only species data. This has allowed scientists to exploit the large amounts of species data held in global biogeographic databases. Despite improvements in model algorithms, environmental data and species presences, there are still limitations to the reliability of these techniques, especially in poorly studied areas such as the deep sea. Recent studies have begun to address a key limitation, the quality of data, by using multibeam echosounder surveys and species data from video surveys to acquire high-resolution data. Whilst these data are often amongst the very best that can be acquired, the surveys are highly localised, often targeted towards known VME-containing areas, are very expensive and time consuming. It is financially prohibitive to survey whole regions or ocean basins using these techniques, so alternative cost-effective approaches are required. Here, we review 'presence-background' SDMs in the context of those studies conducted in the deep sea. The issues of sampling bias, spatial autocorrelation, spatial scale, model evaluation and validation are considered in detail, and reference is made to recent developments in species distribution modelling literature. Further information is provided on how these approaches are being used to influence ocean management, and best practises are outlined to aid the effective adoption of these techniques in the future. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Understanding the impact of past climatic events on species may facilitate predictions of how species will respond to future climate change. To this end, we sampled populations of the common pond snail Radix balthica over the entire species range (northwestern Europe). Using a recently developed analytical framework that employs ecological niche modelling to obtain hypotheses that are subsequently tested with statistical phylogeography, we inferred the range dynamics of R. balthica over time. A Maxent modelling for present-day conditions was performed to infer the climate envelope for the species, and the modelled niche was used to hindcast climatically suitable range at the last glacial maximum (LGM) c. 21 000 years ago. Ecological niche modelling predicted two suitable areas at the LGM within the present species range. Phylogeographic model selection on a COI mitochondrial DNA data set confirmed that R. balthica most likely spread from these two disjunct refuges after the LGM. The match observed between the potential range of the species at the LGM given its present climatic requirements and the phylogeographically inferred refugial areas was a clear argument in favour of niche conservatism in R. balthica, thus allowing to predict the future range. The subsequent projection of the potential range under a global change scenario predicts a moderate pole-ward shift of the northern range limits, but a dramatic loss of areas currently occupied in France, western Great Britain and southern Germany. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.},

abstract = {Why does the neutral theory, which is based on unrealistic assumptions, predict diversity patterns so accurately? Answering questions like this requires a radical change in the way we tackle them. The large number of degrees of freedom of ecosystems pose a fundamental obstacle to mechanistic modelling. However, there are tools of statistical physics, such as the maximum entropy formalism (MaxEnt), that allow transcending particular models to simultaneously work with immense families of models with different rules and parameters, sharing only well-established features. We applied MaxEnt allowing species to be ecologically idiosyncratic, instead of constraining them to be equivalent as the neutral theory does. The answer we found is that neutral models are just a subset of the majority of plausible models that lead to the same patterns. Small variations in these patterns naturally lead to the main classical species abundance distributions, which are thus unified in a single framework. {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

It harbours more endemic carnivores than does any other island except Madagascar. Almost half the Bornean carnivore species have been classified by The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as threatened. Because little is known about most Bornean carnivores, predicting their spatial distribution is important for management strategies to improve the conservation of these species. As a part of the 1st Borneo Carnivore Symposium (BCS) we started to assemble a knowledge base of Bornean carnivores. We established the Borneo Carnivore Database which contains the previously largely fragmented occurrence records of carnivores on the island and then used these records to predict the distribution of 20 Bornean carnivores (all native species except sun bear Helarctos malayanus and the four otter species, Eurasian otter Lutra lutra, Asian smallclawed otter Aonyx cinereus, hairy-nosed otter Lutra sumatrana and smooth-coated otter Lutrogale perspicillata). We describe general considerations – the underlying assumptions, advantages, and most importantly the limitations and constraints – of species distribution modelling. We then summarise the methodological framework of our modelling approach and results of the sensitivity analyses. We emphasise that despite the extensive efforts to compile existing information, so few or spatially biased occurrence records exist for some species that the model outcomes presented in this journal issue must be interpreted cautiously. We recommend using new data as they become available to test our projections and improve our understanding of carnivore distributions on Borneo. {\textcopyright} 2016 National University of Singapore.},

Using a novel method, we show how to exploit satellite data to analyse whether and how a migratory species responds to fluctuating environmental conditions in its wintering area. This is particularly crucial for establishing comprehensive conservation measures for rare species in areas that are threatened by increasing land use and climate change. 2.We use ST data of Eleonora's falcon Falco eleonorae, a long-distance migratory raptor that winters in Madagascar, and assess the performance of static species distribution models (SDM) as well as multi-temporal models. ST data were derived from seven falcons tracked during three consecutive wintering periods and for a total of 2410 bearings, of which 512 locations were used in SDMs. We employed environmental predictors (climate, topography and land cover) with a spatial resolution of 30arc seconds (c. 1km 2) to match rigorously filtered ST data with an accuracy of ≤1km. 3.We first created a model with low temporal but high spatial resolution (half-year). To predict suitable habitat for each month of the wintering season, we took advantage of the high temporal resolution inherent in ST data and employed temporally corresponding remote sensing data [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 10-day composites] together with other variables to create monthly models. 4.We show that ST data are suited to build robust and transferable SDMs despite a low number of tracked individuals. Multi-temporal SMDs further revealed seasonal responses of the study species to changing environmental conditions in its wintering area. 5.Synthesis and applications. We present a transferable approach to predict the potential distribution of organisms as well as their dynamic response to changing environmental conditions. Future conservation management plans could include the prediction of a species' reaction to changing land-use practices or climate change based on the methodology proposed here.

abstract = {The abundant centre model predicts that species abundance will decline from the centre towards the periphery of the geographic range. Thus, we expect to find decreases from the centre towards the edge in variables related to population dynamics such as population density and reproductive output. However, evidence for this pattern is contradictory, suggesting that geographically peripheral sites may not be ecologically peripheral. Populations may thrive in pockets of suitable habitat at the edge of the range or may be locally adapted to peripheral conditions. This study examines how the position of a site within geographic and climatic ranges of 13 species is related to the population dynamics at one common location, The Desert Laboratory at Tumamoc Hill, Tucson, AZ, USA. We used data on survival, fecundity, germination fraction and population density from a 25-year long-term data set on winter annual plants to determine whether there was a relationship between distance to the centre of the range and population dynamics. Geographic distance was calculated by determining the distance from the Desert Laboratory to the centre of the observed range determined from locality records. Climatic distance was calculated using the niche modelling software, maxent, and subtracting the mean climatic profile for the species range from that of the Desert Laboratory. There was no relationship between mean population metrics and distance metrics. We found significant relationships between some geographic distance metrics and variance in fecundity, survival and per-germinant fecundity, but not germination fraction or population density. We did not find a relationship with any metric of population dynamic variation and climatic distance. Synthesis.Our results indicate that geographic distance from the centre of the range of 13 annual plant species more strongly predicts their population dynamics than climatic distance. This study reinforces the importance of examining vital rates and their variation in order to properly capture the effect of position within a range on population dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Background and Aims: Recent climatic warming trends are evident from observational studies, and investigating the likely impact of climate change on biological systems is of substantial importance. In this study, MaxEnt modelling has been applied to predict the possible effect of climate change on winegrape distribution across Europe using the basic bioclimatic variables. The proportion of potential area lost because of warming was estimated for the most important wine-producing countries. Methods and Results: A MaxEnt modelling approach was used to predict the possible effect of climate change on the distribution of winegrape (Vitis vinifera) across Europe using basic bioclimatic variables. The predictions of the climate models, Hadley Centre Coupled Model 3 and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization MK3, were used to obtain potential changes in climatic suitability for growing winegrapes. The area loss is calculated for the main wine-producing countries in Europe, Portugal, Spain, France and Italy. Annual mean temperature was significant to model performance, and predicted suitable areas fitted well against the known winegrowing regions. Future predictions showed consistent changes based on a range of climate scenarios, with winegrowing regions predicted to shift northward. At the same time, additional problems may arise in the Mediterranean region as the most significant area loss is predicted for these regions. Conclusions: The predicted range stability until 2050 is dynamic, implying adaptations such as changing of grape cultivar and selection or modification of grapevine management could be necessary even in those regions which remain suitable in the future. Significance of the Study: To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the future distribution of winegrapes in Europe in response to global warming using MaxEnt modelling. Area loss was considered for only those locations where viticulture was covered by the CORINE database. This approach provides more realistic information, since the area suitable for winegrape cultivation is evidently much larger than the realised range. {\textcopyright} 2016 Australian Society of Viticulture and Oenology Inc.},

abstract = {Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), the cause of chytridiomycosis, is a pathogenic fungus that is found worldwide and is a major contributor to amphibian declines and extinctions. We report results of a comprehensive effort to assess the distribution and threat of Bd in one of the Earth's most important biodiversity hotspots, the Albertine Rift in central Africa. In herpetological surveys conducted between 2010 and 2014, 1018 skin swabs from 17 amphibian genera in 39 sites across the Albertine Rift were tested for Bd by PCR. Overall, 19.5{\%}of amphibians tested positive from all sites combined. Skin tissue samples from163 amphibians were examined histologically; of these two had superficial epidermal intracorneal fungal colonization and lesions consistent with the disease chytridiomycosis. One amphibian was found dead during the surveys, and all others encountered appeared healthy. We found no evidence for Bd-induced mortality events, a finding consistent with other studies. To gain a historical perspective about Bd in the Albertine Rift, skin swabs from 232 museum-archived amphibians collected as voucher specimens from1925-1994 were tested for Bd. Of these, one sample was positive; an Itombwe River frog (Phrynobatrachus asper) collected in 1950 in the Itombwe highlands. This finding represents the earliest record of Bd in the Democratic Republic of Congo.We modeled the distribution of Bd in the Albertine Rift using MaxEnt software, and trained our model for improved predictability.Our model predicts that Bd is currently widespread across the Albertine Rift, with moderate habitat suitability extending into the lowlands. Under climaticmodeling scenarios our model predicts that optimal habitat suitability of Bd will decrease causing a major range contraction of the fungus by 2080. Our baseline data and modeling predictions are important for comparative studies, especially if significant changes in amphibian health status or climactic conditions are encountered in the future. {\textcopyright} 2015 Copyright Seimon et al.

abstract = {Delimiting the distribution of a species is a complex task because many determining factors are difficult to assess in the field. This is important because distribution is a key factor in the decision-making process for conservation. One example is the Bearded Wood Partridge Dendrortyx barbatus, a species endemic to the temperate forests of the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMO) mountain range in Mexico. Lack of knowledge of its distribution has generated confusion over the assignment of the correct risk category. With the aim of predicting the distribution area of the Bearded Wood Partridge and contributing to strategies for its conservation, we updated and extended the knowledge of its distribution by modelling its ecological niche using GARP and MaxEnt algorithms. We also analysed its environmental distribution using principal components analysis, and contrasted the two most important environmental variables with the species's distribution based on vegetation type. We found that the area potentially occupied by this species covers 17,956 km2 according to GARP and 12,974 km2 according to MaxEnt. We suggest that there is a biogeographic barrier which limits the distribution of this species in the southern part of its range. The abiotic variables that best explain its distribution are average annual precipitation and elevation, both of which coincide well with the distribution of cloud forest. A redefinition of the current range as recognised by IUCN is proposed along with the need to change its national risk category. {\textcopyright} BirdLife International 2012.},

When we used only climate variables to model the human settlement suitability, the AUC value for training and test was 0.783 and 0.766. Then, we added DEM and its derived variables, the AUC value for training and test was raised to 0.812 and 0.802. The predicted higher proper extent was coincidence with population distribution and the main city distribution, which includes Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei Province, Shandong Province, Henan Province, Jiangsu Province, Anhui Province, Hubei Province, Sichuan Province and Shaanxi Province.

abstract = {Aim: Ecological niche models are increasingly being used to aid in predicting the effects of future climate change on species distributions. Complex models that show high predictive performance on current distribution data may do a poor job of predicting new data due to overfitting. In addition, model performance is often evaluated using techniques that are sensitive to spatial sampling bias. Here, we explore the effects of model complexity and spatial sampling bias on niche models for 90 vertebrate taxa of conservation concern. Location: California, USA. Methods: We used Akaike information criterion (AICc) to select variables and tune Maxent's built-in regularization parameter ($\beta$) to constrain model complexity. In addition, we incorporated several estimates of spatial sampling bias based on interpolations of target group data. Ensemble forecasts were developed for future conditions from two emission scenarios and three climate change models for the year 2050. Results: Reducing the number of predictors and tuning $\beta$ resulted in a reduction in the number of parameters in models built with sample sizes greater than approximately 10 occurrence points. Reducing the number of predictors had a substantially higher impact on the relative prioritization of different grid cells than did increasing regularization. There was little difference in prioritization of habitat when comparing models built using different spatial sampling bias estimates. Over half of the taxa were predicted to experience {\textgreater}80{\%} reductions in environmental suitability in currently occupied cells, and this pattern was consistent across taxonomic groups. Main Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that reducing the number of correlated predictor variables tends to decrease the breadth of models, while tuning regularization using AICc tends to increase it. These two strategies may provide a reasonable bracketing strategy for assessing climate change impacts. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Information on exotic species' current and potential distribution is vital for decisions on management. Species distribution models can predict where colonizations are likely; however, the collection of species' distribution data over large areas in order to parameterize the models is costly. Therefore, modelling methods that are able to use low-cost information such as citizen-reported data are potentially very useful. In this study, we used the species habitat modelling program Maxent to predict the potential geographical distribution of two non-native insect species in Sweden, the butterfly Araschnia levana and the shield bug Graphosoma lineatum. For this we used citizen-reported presence-only open-access data in combination with climate and land cover data from national databases. Our models showed that presence of A. levana was best predicted by winter temperature and habitats related to open grasslands. For G. lineatum, summer temperature and open green areas, in both urban and rural areas were the best predictors for species presence. These models show that large areas of non-colonized potential habitats exist within Sweden. For A. levana these yet-to-be-colonized habitats are mainly in the south, while for G. lineatum these habitats occur in the south and along the Baltic Sea coast. Comparisons of temporal patterns in species reporting for A. levana and G. lineatum to similar insects with known stable populations revealed large 'willingness to report' effects that could potentially bias range expansion rates. Once corrected for, current distribution expansion rates were estimated as 1.9 km/yr and 1.07 km/yr respectively. The study shows the use of public reports in conservation science as a way of gathering species information over large areas. This increases the data sources available for researchers to predict the distribution of species and have the additional value of the involvement of the public in conservation efforts. {\textcopyright} 2014 Widenfalk et al.},

abstract = {Background: The lack of available vaccines and consistent sporadic transmission of WNV justify the need for mosquito vector control and prediction of their geographic distribution. However, the distribution of WNV transmission is dependent on the mosquito vector and the ecological requirements, which vary from one place to another. Methods: Presence/density data of two WNV mosquito vectors, Culex nigripalpus and Cx. quinquefasciatus, was extracted within 5 km buffer zones around seropositive records of sentinel chickens in order to delineate their predicting variables and model the habitat suitability of probable infective mosquito using MaxEnt software. Different correlations between density data of the extracted mosquito vectors and 27 climate, land use-land cover, and land surface terrain variables were analyzed using linear regression analysis. Accordingly, the correlated predicting variables were used in building up habitat suitability model for the occurrence records of both mosquito vectors using MaxEnt. Results: The density of both WNV mosquito vectors showed variation in their ecological requirements. Eight predicting variables, out of 27, had significant influence on density of Cx. nigripalpus. Precipitation of driest months was shown to be the best predicting variable for the density of this vector (R 2 = 41.70). Whereas, two variables were proven to predict the distribution of Cx. quinquefasciatus density. Vegetation showed the maximum predicting gain to the density of this mosquito vector (R 2 = 15.74), where nestling birds, in particular exotics, are found. Moreover, Jackknife analysis in MaxEnt demonstrated that urbanization and vegetation data layers significantly contribute in predicting habitat suitability of Cx. nigripalpus and Cx. quinquefasciatus occurrence, respectively, which justifies the contribution of the former in urban and the latter in epizootic transmission cycles of WNV. In addition, habitat suitability risk maps were produced for both vectors in response to their predicting variables. Conclusions: For the first time in the study area, a quantitative relationship between 27 predicting variables and two WNV mosquito vectors within their foraging habitats was highlighted at the local scale. Accordingly, the predicting variables were used to produce a practical distribution map of probable infective mosquito vectors. This substantially helps in determining where suitable habitats are found. This will potentially help in designing target surveillance and control programmes, saving money, time and man-power. However, the suitability risk maps should be updated when serological and entomological data updates are available. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s).},

After determination of homogeneous units, vegetation sampling was carried out using random systematic method. Depending on the plant species, the plot size was determined using Minimal Area method from 2 to 25m2. Sample size was also determined to be 60 plots with respect to vegetation cover variations using statistical method. In order to sample the soil at each habitat, eight holes was drilled and samples were taken from 0 to 30 and 30 to 80cm depths. Plant distribution modeling was conducted using LR, the MaxEnt and ANN. After implementation of the model, to evaluate and predict the actual maps conformity, Kappa coefficient and true skill statistic (TSS) were measured. On the basis of Kappa and TSS values calculated, prediction accuracy of the methods used varies for different habitats. Results indicate that LR model is capable to predict habitats distribution of Halocnemum strobilaceum, which has limited ecological niche at very good level ($\kappa$=0.71). The model obtained from the MaxEnt could predict habitat distribution of Artemisia sieberi at very good level. However, the prediction maps derived from ANN models for all studied habitats were obtained to be at good and very good level. Results indicate a strong relationship between model performance and the kinds of species distributions being modeled. Some methods performed generally better, but no method was superior in all circumstances. Based on these results it can be said that in order to choose the optimal approach of habitats distribution modeling in addition to the statistical considerations, purpose and expected accuracy, data available types, ecological niche range of species and be interpreted of method in terms of ecological concepts also should be considered. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Ecological niche modeling (ENM), a process that utilizes computer-based algorithms to mathematically estimate a species ecological niche, was employed to test this hypothesis. Additionally, the efficacy of using the ENM program Maxent with fossil data was tested against a well-established ENM method (GARP). Results indicate that during intervals of gradual change, species conserved the parameters of their ecological niches to higher degrees than during intervals of ecological rapid biotic change, when niche evolution was common. Native and invasive species displayed congruent patterns of niche stability, but niche conservatism was more common in broadly adapted generalist species than ecological specialists. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The optimistic scenario, based in a 0.5{\%} increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, predicts an increase of up to 2 °C in the Earth's average temperature; in the pessimistic scenario, based on a 1{\%} increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, temperature increase may reach 4 °C. Using these parameters, the occurrence points of the studied species registered in literature, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Predictions/GARP and Maximum entropy modeling of species geographic distributions/MaxEnt we developed models of present and future possible occurrence of each species, considering Earth's mean temperature by 2050 with the optimistic and the pessimistic scenarios of CO2 emission. The results obtained show an alarming reduction in the area of possible occurrence of the species studied, as well as a shift towards southern areas of Brazil.

Designated outbreaks were used as input presence data, while the bioclim set of ecological and climatic variables, together with some geographic factors, were used as explanatory variables. The model demonstrated a high predictive ability. The area under the curve for farm livestock was 0.782, for domestic animals -0.859 and for wild animals - 0.809. Based on the model, the map of integral risk was designed by following four categories: negligible risk (disease-free or favourable zone), low risk (surveillance zone), medium risk (vaccination zone), and high risk (unfavourable zone). The map was produced to allow developing a set of preventive measures and is expected to contribute to a better distribution of supervisory efforts from the veterinary service of the country. {\textcopyright} S.K.

abstract = {Analysis of an invasive species' niche shift between native and introduced ranges, along with potential distribution maps, can provide valuable information about its invasive potential. The tawny crazy ant, Nylanderia fulva, is a rapidly emerging and economically important invasive species in the southern United States. It is originally from east-central South America and has also invaded Colombia and the Caribbean Islands. Our objectives were to generate a global potential distribution map for N. fulva, identify important climatic drivers associated with its current distribution, and test whether N. fulva's realized climatic niche has shifted across its invasive range. We used MaxEnt niche model to map the potential distribution of N. fulva using its native and invaded range occurrences and climatic variables. We used principal component analysis methods for investigating potential shifts in the realized climatic niche of N. fulva during invasion. We found strong evidence for a shift in the realized climatic niche of N. fulva across its invasive range. Our models predicted potentially suitable habitat for N. fulva in the United States and other parts of the world. Our analyses suggest that the majority of observed occurrences of N. fulva in the United States represent stabilizing populations. Mean diurnal range in temperature, degree days at ≥10°C, and precipitation of driest quarter were the most important variables associated with N. fulva distribution. The climatic niche expansion demonstrated in our study may suggest significant plasticity in the ability of N. fulva to survive in areas with diverse temperature ranges shown by its tolerance for environmental conditions in the southern United States, Caribbean Islands, and Colombia. The risk maps produced in this study can be useful in preventing N. fulva's future spread, and in managing and monitoring currently infested areas. {\textcopyright} 2015 Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {The southern European peninsulas (Iberian, Italian and Balkan) are traditionally recognized as glacial refugia from where many species colonized central and northern Europe after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, evidence that some species had more northerly refugia is accumulating from phylogeographic, palaeontological and palynological studies, and more recently from species distribution modelling (SDM), but further studies are needed to test the idea of northern refugia in Europe. Here, we take a rarely implemented multidisciplinary approach to assess if the pygmy shrew Sorex minutus, a widespread Eurasian mammal species, had northern refugia during the LGM, and if these influenced its postglacial geographic distribution. First, we evaluated the phylogeographic and population expansion patterns using mtDNA sequence data from 123 pygmy shrews. Then, we used SDM to predict present and past (LGM) potential distributions using two different training data sets, two different algorithms (Maxent and GARP) and climate reconstructions for the LGM with two different general circulation models. An LGM distribution in the southern peninsulas was predicted by the SDM approaches, in line with the occurrence of lineages of S. minutus in these areas. The phylogeographic analyses also indicated a widespread and strictly northern-central European lineage, not derived from southern peninsulas, and with a postglacial population expansion signature. This was consistent with the SDM predictions of suitable LGM conditions for S. minutus occurring across central and eastern Europe, from unglaciated parts of the British Isles to much of the eastern European Plain. Hence, S. minutus likely persisted in parts of central and eastern Europe during the LGM, from where it colonized other northern areas during the late-glacial and postglacial periods. Our results provide new insights into the glacial and postglacial colonization history of the European mammal fauna, notably supporting glacial refugia further north than traditionally recognized. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Context. The impacts of climate change on the climate envelopes, and hence, distributions of species, are of ongoing concern for biodiversity worldwide. Knowing where climate refuge habitats will occur in the future is essential to conservation planning. The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is recognised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a species highly vulnerable to climate change. However, the impact of climate change on its distribution is poorly understood. Aims. We aimed to predict the likely shifts in the climate envelope of the koala throughout its natural distribution under various climate change scenarios and identify potential future climate refugia. Methods. To predict possible future koala climate envelopes we developed bioclimatic models using Maxent, based on a substantial database of locality records and several climate change scenarios. Key results. The predicted current koala climate envelope was concentrated in south-east Queensland, eastern New South Wales and eastern Victoria, which generally showed congruency with their current known distribution. Under realistic projected future climate change, with the climate becoming increasingly drier and warmer, the models showed a significant progressive eastward and southward contraction in the koala's climate envelope limit in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The models also indicated novel potentially suitable climate habitat in Tasmania and south-western Australia. Conclusions. Under a future hotter and drier climate, current koala distributions, based on their climate envelope, will likely contract eastwards and southwards to many regions where koala populations are declining due to additional threats of high human population densities and ongoing pressures from habitat loss, dog attacks and vehicle collisions. In arid and semiarid regions such as the Mulgalands of south-western Queensland, climate change is likely to compoundthe impacts of habitat loss, resulting in significant contractions in the distribution of this species. Implications. Climate change pressures will likely change priorities for allocating conservation efforts for many species. Conservation planning needs to identify areas that will provide climatically suitable habitat for a species in a changing climate. In the case of the koala, inland habitats are likely to become climatically unsuitable, increasing the need to protect and restore the more mesic habitats, which are under threat from urbanisation. National and regional koala conservation policies need to anticipate these changes and synergistic threats. Therefore, a proactive approach to conservation planning is necessary to protect the koala and other species that depend on eucalypt forests. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2011.},

abstract = {Assessment of the suitability of anthropogenic landscapes for wildlife species is crucial for setting priorities for biodiversity conservation. This study aimed to analyse the environmental suitability of a highly fragmented region of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the world's 25 recognized biodiversity hotspots, for forest bird species. Eight forest bird species were selected for the analyses, based on point counts (n = 122) conducted in April-September 2006 and January-March 2009. Six additional variables (landscape diversity, distance from forest and streams, aspect, elevation and slope) were modelled in Maxent for (1) actual and (2) simulated land cover, based on the forest expansion required by existing Brazilian forest legislation. Models were evaluated by bootstrap or jackknife methods and their performance was assessed by AUC, omission error, binomial probability or p value. All predictive models were statistically significant, with high AUC values and low omission errors. A small proportion of the actual landscape (24.41 ± 6.31{\%}) was suitable for forest bird species. The simulated landscapes lead to an increase of c.30{\%} in total suitable areas. In average, models predicted a small increase (23.69 ± 6.95{\%}) in the area of suitable native forest for bird species. Being close to forest increased the environmental suitability of landscapes for all bird species; landscape diversity was also a significant factor for some species. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that species distribution modelling (SDM) successfully predicted bird distribution across a heterogeneous landscape at fine spatial resolution, as all models were biologically relevant and statistically significant. The use of landscape variables as predictors contributed significantly to the results, particularly for species distributions over small extents and at fine scales. This is the first study to evaluate the environmental suitability of the remaining Brazilian Atlantic Forest for bird species in an agricultural landscape, and provides important additional data for regional environmental planning. {\textcopyright} Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2012.},

abstract = {In 2007 African swine fever (ASF) entered Georgia and in the same year the disease entered the Russian Federation. From 2007 to 2012 ASF spread throughout the southern region of the Russian Federation. At the same time several cases of ASF were detected in the central and northern regions of the Russian Federation, forming a northern cluster of outbreaks in 2011. This northern cluster is of concern because of its proximity to mainland Europe. The aim of this study was to use details of recorded ASF outbreaks and human and swine population details to estimate the spatial distribution of ASF risk in the southern region of the European part of the Russian Federation. Our model of ASF risk was comprised of two components. The first was an estimate of ASF suitability scores calculated using maximum entropy methods. The second was an estimate of ASF risk as a function of Euclidean distance from index cases. An exponential distribution fitted to a frequency histogram of the Euclidean distance between consecutive ASF cases had a mean value of 156. km, a distance greater than the surveillance zone radius of 100-150. km stated in the ASF control regulations for the Russian Federation. We show that the spatial and temporal risk of ASF expansion is related to the suitability of the area of potential expansion, which is in turn a function of socio-economic and geographic variables. We propose that the methodology presented in this paper provides a useful tool to optimize surveillance for ASF in affected areas. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: The species Zea mays includes both domesticated maize (ssp. mays) and its closest wild relatives known as the teosintes. While genetic and archaeological studies have provided a well-established history of Z. mays evolution, there is currently minimal description of its current and past distribution. Here, we implemented species distribution modeling using paleoclimatic models of the last interglacial (LI; {\~{}}135,000 BP) and the last glacial maximum (LGM; {\~{}}21,000 BP) to hindcast the distribution of Zea mays subspecies over time and to revisit current knowledge of its phylogeography and evolutionary history. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a large occurrence data set and the distribution modeling MaxEnt algorithm, we obtained robust present and past species distributions of the two widely distributed teosinte subspecies (ssps. parviglumis and mexicana) revealing almost perfect complementarity, stable through time, of their occupied distributions. We also investigated the present distributions of primitive maize landraces, which overlapped but were broader than those of the teosintes. Our data reinforced the idea that little historical gene flow has occurred between teosinte subspecies, but maize has served as a genetic bridge between them. We observed an expansion of teosinte habitat from the LI, consistent with population genetic data. Finally, we identified locations potentially serving as refugia for the teosintes throughout epochs of climate change and sites that should be targeted in future collections. Conclusion/Significance: The restricted and highly contrasting ecological niches of the wild teosintes differ substantially from domesticated maize. Variables determining the distributions of these taxa can inform future considerations of local adaptation and the impacts of climate change. Our assessment of the changing distributions of Zea mays taxa over time offers a unique glimpse into the history of maize, highlighting a strategy for the study of domestication that may prove useful for other species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Hufford et al.},

abstract = {The Aurignacian technocomplex comprises a succession of culturally distinct phases. Between its first two subdivisions, the Proto-Aurignacian and the Early Aurignacian, we see a shift from single to separate reduction sequences for blade and bladelet production, the appearance of split-based antler points, and a number of other changes in stone tool typology and technology as well as in symbolic material culture. Bayesian modeling of available 14C determinations, conducted within the framework of this study, indicates that these material culture changes are coincident with abrupt and marked climatic changes. The Proto-Aurignacian occurs during an interval (ca. 41.5-39.9 k cal BP) of relative climatic amelioration, Greenland Interstadials (GI) 10 and 9, punctuated by a short cold stadial. The Early Aurignacian (ca. 39.8-37.9 k cal BP) predominantly falls within the climatic phase known as Heinrich Stadial (HS) 4, and its end overlaps with the beginning of GI 8, the former being predominantly characterized by cold and dry conditions across the European continent. We use eco-cultural niche modeling to quantitatively evaluate whether these shifts in material culture are correlated with environmental variability and, if so, whether the ecological niches exploited by human populations shifted accordingly. We employ genetic algorithm (GARP) and maximum entropy (Maxent) techniques to estimate the ecological niches exploited by humans (i.e., eco-cultural niches) during these two phases of the Aurignacian. Partial receiver operating characteristic analyses are used to evaluate niche variability between the two phases.Results indicate that the changes in material culture between the Proto-Aurignacian and the Early Aurignacian are associated with an expansion of the ecological niche. These shifts in both the eco-cultural niche and material culture are interpreted to represent an adaptive response to the relative deterioration of environmental conditions at the onset of HS4. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Caatinga biome has been identified as one of the important wilderness areas on earth. However, less than 1{\%} of the region is under strictly legal protection although Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTFs) are globally highly endangered. There is an urgent need to increase the understanding of diversity pattern and threaten status of Caatinga plant species to preserve the unique biodiversity and protect endangered species. Species distribution modelling (SDM) can support strategic decisions in nature conservation for poorly researched tropical regions. This study provides the first highly representative, spatially explicit overview of plant diversity and threat status for the entire Caatinga, a semi-arid area in Northeast Brazil. For this purpose, we developed (a) a stacked species distribution modelling (S-SDM) approach to predict quantitatively floristic species richness and patterns of threatened plant species and (b) a combined approach of diversity hot spots and hubs of threatened species to derive conservation importance units (CIU) to contribute to improved nature reserve management. We applied the modelling technique MaxEnt to establish predictive distribution models with 22 uncorrelated predictors including climate, topography, solar radiation and soil information at a high spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds (approx. 1 km). Spatial patterns of species richness and threat status were derived by stacking 1062 plant species and 27 endangered species, respectively. These outputs were compared to two levels of protected areas (Brazilian and international standards) and intensive human land use patterns to define a set of recommendations for conservation management. Our complementary S-SDM approach showed that our predicted CIUs covered an area of 24{\%} across the entire biome, whereas only 7{\%} of the Caatinga is currently protected based on the Brazilian standards. We found that apart from an excellent overlap of 38{\%} between CIUs and the current protected areas, a substantial proportion of CIUs (89{\%}) was predicted outside the existing reserve network. Moreover, our findings enable targeted surveys to be done in order to enhance conservation efforts and ensure the efficient use of available resources in this poorly studied tropical region. Future upcoming local and regional studies could focus on a multi-taxonomic approach including e.g. insects, reptiles or mammals as a holistic perspective towards biodiversity conservation. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

Future climate change predictions agree that changes in rainfall, temperature, and seasonality will impact Ethiopia with dramatic consequences. When, where, and how these changes will transpire has not been adequately addressed. The objective of our study was to model how projected climate change scenarios will spatially and temporally impact cereal production, a dietary staple for millions of Ethiopians. We used Maxent software fit with crop data collected from household surveys and bioclimatic variables from the WorldClim database to develop spatially explicit models of crop production in Ethiopia. Our results were extrapolated to three climate change projections (i.e., Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis, Hadley Centre Coupled Model v3, and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization), each having two emission scenarios. Model evaluations indicated that our results had strong predictability for all four cereal crops with area under the curve values of 0.79, 0.81, 0.79, and 0.83 for teff, maize, sorghum, and barley, respectively. As expected, bioclimatic variables related to rainfall were the greatest predictors for all four cereal crops. All models showed similar decreasing spatial trends in cereal production. In addition, there were geographic shifts in land suitability which need to be accounted for when assessing overall vulnerability to climate change. The ability to adapt to climate change will be critical for Ethiopia's agricultural system and food security. Spatially explicit models will be vital for developing early warning systems, adaptive strategies, and policy to minimize the negative impacts of climate change on food production. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Aim: Our goal was to use the occurrence of the influenza A virus in wild birds in Japan to create a potential risk map for the spread of avian influenza by migratory birds. Our modelling included a consideration of the multicollinearity and spatial autocorrelation of environmental variables and an examination of the reproducibility of the model results. Location: Japan. Methods: We used the maximum entropy approach to generate potential distribution models from presence-only data. Independent variables in the model included environmental factors such as winter temperature and precipitation, host factors such as duck population size and habitat abundance and artificial factors such as size of urban areas and poultry density. We used eigenvector-based spatial filters to alleviate spatial autocorrelation. To explore the reliability of the model, we compared the risk indices of localities positive in past winters for the influenza A virus in wild birds with those of all localities. Results: The model alleviated spatial autocorrelation with a high degree of accuracy. Dabbling duck population, size of urban area, diving duck population and altitude were the variables that were most strongly correlated with the potential distribution of avian influenza. We used the frequency of occurrence of the influenza A virus in five recent years in localities where wild birds were infected to estimate the repeatability of the high-risk indices; the potential risk indices for avian influenza in wild birds were high in localities where wild birds were infected in past. Main conclusions: The dabbling duck population in an area appeared to be the best indicator of high risk for the introduction of avian influenza from abroad.

abstract = {Aim To predict how the bioclimatic envelope of the broad-headed snake (BHS) (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) may be redistributed under future climate warming scenarios. Location South-eastern New South Wales, Australia. Methods We used 159 independent locations for the species and 35 climatic variables to model the bioclimatic envelope for the BHS using two modelling approaches - Bioclim and Maxent. Predictions were made under current climatic conditions and we also predicted the species distribution under low and high climate change scenarios for 2030 and 2070. Results Broad-headed snakes currently encompass their entire bioclimatic envelope. Both modelling approaches predict that suitable climate space for BHS will be lost to varying degrees under both climate warming scenarios, and under the worst case, only 14{\%} of known snake populations may persist. Main conclusions Areas of higher elevation within the current range will be most important for persistence of this species because they will remain relatively moist and cool even under climate change and will match the current climate envelope. Conservation efforts should focus on areas where suitable climate space may persist under climate warming scenarios. Long-term monitoring programs should be established both in these areas and where populations are predicted to become extirpated, so that we can accurately determine changes in the distribution of this species throughout its range. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Our research was based on 258 specimens of P. biguttatus species of museum collections. A set of 23 environmental predictor variables covering Africa was used at ecological niche modeling - a method performed using the Maxent software to prepare potential distribution maps for this species. Results: The results suggested the most suitable areas seen as potentially suitable ecological niche for P. biguttatus in Africa. A jackknife test showed that temperature seasonality and percentage of tree cover were among the most important environmental variables affecting the distribution of the species. The analysis of climate preferences shows that most of the potentially suitable niches for this species were located in the area of tropical savanna climate, with a small participation of tree vegetation. Conclusions: P. biguttatus was only known to be widely distributed in the tropical part of continental Africa. Thanks to the ecological niche modeling methods and the museum data on the occurrence of the species, we introduced new information about potentially suitable ecological niches and the possible range of distribution. {\textcopyright} 2015 Ch{\l}ond et al.; licensee Springer.},

abstract = {Background: Accurate predictions of species distributions are essential for climate change impact assessments. However the standard practice of using long-term climate averages to train species distribution models might mute important temporal patterns of species distribution. The benefit of using temporally explicit weather and distribution data has not been assessed. We hypothesized that short-term weather associated with the time a species was recorded should be superior to long-term climate measures for predicting distributions of mobile species. Methodology: We tested our hypothesis by generating distribution models for 157 bird species found in Australian tropical savannas (ATS) using modelling algorithm Maxent. The variable weather of the ATS supports a bird assemblage with variable movement patterns and a high incidence of nomadism. We developed "weather" models by relating climatic variables (mean temperature, rainfall, rainfall seasonality and temperature seasonality) from the three month, six month and one year period preceding each bird record over a 58 year period (1950-2008). These weather models were compared against models built using long-term (30 year) averages of the same climatic variables. Conclusions: Weather models consistently achieved higher model scores than climate models, particularly for wide-ranging, nomadic and desert species. Climate models predicted larger range areas for species, whereas weather models quantified fluctuations in habitat suitability across months, seasons and years. Models based on long-term climate averages overestimate availability of suitable habitat and species' climatic tolerances, masking species potential vulnerability to climate change. Our results demonstrate that dynamic approaches to distribution modelling, such as incorporating organismappropriate temporal scales, improves understanding of species distributions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Reside et al.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of baleen whale distribution is essential to predict how environmental changes can affect their ecology and, in turn, ecosystem functioning. Recent work showed that mid-latitude habitats along migratory routes may play an important role on the feeding ecology of baleen whales. This study aimed to investigate the function of a mid-latitude habitat for blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (Balaenoptera physalus) and sei (Balaenoptera borealis) whales occurring in sympatry during spring and summer months and to what extent their environmental niches overlap. We addressed those questions by developing environmental niche models (ENM) for each species and then making pairwise comparisons of niche overlap and relative habitat patch importance among the three species. ENMs were created using sightings from the Azorean Fisheries Observer Program from May to November, between 2004 and 2009, and a set of 18 predictor environmental variables. We then assessed monthly (April-July) overlap among ENMs using a modified Hellinger's distance metric (I). Results show that the habitat niches of blue and fin whales are strongly influenced by primary productivity and sea surface temperature and are highly dynamic both spatially and temporally due to the oceanography of the region. Niche overlap analyses show that blue and fin whale environmental niches are similar and that the suitable habitats for the two species have high degree of spatial coincidence. These results in combination suggest that this habitat may function as a mid-latitude feeding ground to both species while conditions are adequate. The sei whale model, on the other hand, did not include variables considered to be proxies for prey distribution and little environmental niche overlap was found between this species and the other two. We argue that these results suggest that the region holds little importance as a foraging habitat for the sei whale. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

According to the literature, MARS and MAXENT have never been used in landslide susceptibility modelling, and CART has been used only twice. Twenty independent variables were used as predictors, including lithology as a categorical variable. Two sets of random samples were used, for a total of 90 model replicates (with and without lithology, and with different proportions of positive and negative data). The model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) statistic. The main results are (a) the inclusion of lithology improves the model performance; (b) the best AUC values for single models are MLR (0. 76), MARS (0. 76), CART (0. 77), and MAXENT (0. 78); (c) a smaller amount of negative data provides better results; (d) the models with the highest prediction capability are obtained with MAXENT and CART; and (e) the combination of different models is a way to evaluate the model reliability.

We used readily available remotely sensed data to analyse this relationship in the three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculatus), an IUCN Vulnerable canopy frugivorous bird that undergoes localized altitudinal and latitudinal movements between several non-breeding and breeding ranges. Location Central America. Methods We generated ecological niche models (GARP and Maxent) based on remotely sensed vegetation indices (enhanced vegetation index, EVI; red index, RI; and normalized difference water index, NDWI) that were used as proxies for canopy characteristics and phenological changes between seasons. The variation in EVI was also analysed in relation to known bellbird seasonal migration patterns. Results Remotely sensed summaries of intra-annual vegetation variation could not explain known movement patterns of bellbirds breeding in Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, Costa Rica. The ecological niche modelling (ENM) framework used for exploring potential movement patterns of another population of bellbirds, observed in March 2004 in Corcovado National Park, Costa Rica, showed that the Atlantic and Pacific lowlands are suitable for the bellbirds year-round, while middle elevations, where breeding may occur, have limited suitability. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that: (1) the Corcovado population tracks similar environmental conditions during the non-breeding season; (2) migration to middle elevation breeding sites might be related to factors other than vegetation seasonality or breeding might not be restricted to these elevation ranges; and (3) the lowlands comprising most of the suitable areas for bellbirds are where anthropogenic pressure is highest, so conservation status should consider this threat, and conservation planning should emphasize these areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Sampling bias in geographic space leads to localities that may also be biased in environmental space. If so, the model can overfit to those biases. As a preliminary test addressing this issue, we used Maxent, bioclimatic variables, and occurrence localities of a broadly distributed Malagasy tenrec, Microgale cowani (Tenrecidae: Oryzorictinae). We modeled the abiotically suitable area of this species using three distinct datasets: unfiltered, spatially filtered, and rarefied unfiltered localities. To quantify overfitting and model performance, we calculated evaluation AUC, the difference between calibration and evaluation AUC (=AUCdiff), and omission rates. Models made with the filtered dataset showed lower overfitting and better performance than the other two suites of models, having lower omission rates and AUCdiff, and a higher AUCevaluation. Additionally, the rarefied unfiltered dataset performed better than the unfiltered one for three evaluation metrics, likely because the larger one reinforced the biases. These results indicate that spatial filtering of occurrence localities may allow biogeographers to produce better models. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Epiphyllous liverworts form a special group of bryophytes that primarily grow on leaves of understory vascular plants, occurring in constantly moist and warm evergreen forest in tropical and subtropical regions. They are very sensitive to climate change and environmental pollution. Previous studies have focused largely on microhabitat preferences of epiphyllous liverworts and demonstrated the importance of climate factors such as humidity, temperature and light. However, little is known about the relationship between distribution of epiphyllous liverworts and macro-habitat factors at broad spatial scales. Here, we predicated the distribution of epiphyllous liverworts in China based on topographic and bioclimatic variables, as well as satellite-derived vegetation indices at a 1 km spatial resolution using presence-only ecological niche models. We used the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS) to validate the models, and then used the Wilcoxon paired test to compare model performances. Furthermore, we applied the jackknife test to identify the important factors affecting predictions. Our results showed that the highest accuracy (i.e., AUC = 0.98 and TSS = 0.93) in predicting epiphyllous liverworts was achieved by the model that combined climatic and remotely sensed vegetation variables. The satellite-derived annual mean and minimum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as well as the annual mean and minimum Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) emerged as the most important predictors of distribution patterns of epiphyllous liverworts, while climatic variables such as precipitation in the wettest quarter and temperature of the coldest quarter were of ancillary importance. The significant contributions of NDVI and NDWI in defining the distribution range and spatial patterns of epiphyllous liverworts, and the strong relationship between this species and evergreen forest implies that epiphyllous liverworts may be a useful indicator for forest degradation or integrity at broad spatial scales. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Spatial modelling is increasingly being embraced by conservation practitioners and community groups to guide natural-asset management. Despite this boom in popularity, little guidance is often available on choosing the most applicable technique, and the relative merits and drawbacks of each approach. We present a case study in the biodiversity hotspot of south-Western Australia where five forms of spatial modelling have previously been used by community conservation managers in this region: realistic GIS modelling, focal species, proximity analysis, Marxan and MaxEnt. We developed a set of criteria for effective spatial modelling and then evaluated each of these spatial-modelling techniques using these criteria. The criteria used in evaluating spatial-modelling tools were as follows: (1) capacity to quantify barriers to movement; (2) capacity to quantify habitat; (3) capacity to accurately predict target responses; (4) capacity to demonstrate how change will happen over differing time frames; (5) effectiveness of the tool within data limitations of a project; (6) ease to which outputs are understood; (7) utility of the tool within skill limitations of a project; and (8) efficacy within resource limitations of a project. None of the applications used met all criteria. When selecting spatial-modelling applications, a hybrid approach is advocated by using criteria that will reflect both the landscape-level conservation requirements and the capacity and objectives of conservation managers. To do this, we advocate using multiple modelling techniques to identify, quantify and ameliorate threats to meet the needs of regional biota. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2016.},

We provided climatic matching of Asiatic species to North America to assist the range-wide restoration of American chestnut [C. dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.] by incorporating blight-resistant genes from Asiatic species. Location North America, Europe and East Asia. Methods General chestnut biology was reviewed on the basis of published literature and field observations. Chestnut distributions were established using published range maps and literature. Climatic constraints were analysed for the northern and southern distribution limits and the entire range for each species using principal component analysis (PCA) of fourteen bioclimatic variables. Climatic envelope matching was performed for three Chinese species using Maxent modelling to predict corresponding suitable climate zones for those species in North America. Results Chestnuts are primarily distributed in the warm-temperate and subtropical zones in the northern hemisphere. PCA results revealed that thermal gradient was the primary control of chestnut distribution. Climatic spaces of different species overlap with one another to different degrees, but strong similarities are shown especially between Chinese species and American species. Climatic envelope matching suggested that large areas in eastern North America have a favourable climate for Chinese species. Main conclusions The general biological traits and climatic limits of the seven chestnut species are very similar. The predictions of Chinese species climatic range corresponded with most of the historical American chestnut range. Thus, a regionally adapted, blight-resistant, introgressed hybrid American chestnut appears feasible if a sufficiently diverse array of Chinese chestnut germplasm is used as a source of blight resistance. Our study provided a between-continent climate matching approach to facilitate the range-wide species restoration, which can be readily applied in planning the restoration of other threatened or endangered species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Bats are the second-most species-rich mammal group numbering more than 1270 species globally. Our knowledge of their geographic distributions and diversity patterns however is very limited - possibly the poorest among mammals - mainly due to their nocturnal and volant life history, and challenging fieldwork conditions in the tropics where most bat species occur. This knowledge gap obscures the geographic extent of ecosystem services provided by bats (i.e. pollination, seed dispersal and insect control), translates into inefficient conservation policies, and restricts macroecological analyses to coarse spatial resolutions. In contrast to the currently prevailing method of estimating species distributions using expert-drawn range maps, correlative species distribution models (SDMs) can provide estimates at very fine spatial grains and largely account for widespread sample bias as well as the prevalent Wallacean shortfall in species occurrence data. Very few such studies have hitherto been published that cover a large and complete taxonomic group with fine resolution at continental extent. Using an unparalleled amount of occurrence data, the MaxEnt algorithm and tailored solutions to specific modelling challenges, we created SDMs for nearly all 250 African bat species to explore emerging diversity patterns at a resolution of 1km2. Predicted species richness generally increases towards the equator conforming to expectations. Within the tropical area of elevated richness, several pronounced richness peaks and lows stand out, hinting at a complex interplay of determining factors. Richness gradients are often steep, decreasing strongly away from streams, and especially so in savanna biomes. Species richness also seems positively associated with rugged terrain, in particular at lower elevations. Centres of endemism are found primarily at low latitudes near major elevational ranges. Overlap with hotspots of species richness is rather low, and confined to five or six topodiverse, relatively low lying areas between western Guinea and the East African coast. Several poorly sampled regions are identified that may represent rewarding future survey targets. Our results demonstrate the value of stacking SDMs to infer plausible continent-wide diversity gradients at a spatial resolution fine enough to directly inform conservation policies and to open up new avenues in macroecological research. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aim: We aim to assess the temporary transferability of species distribution models (SDMs) for stream fish species in terms of discrimination power and calibration. Location: New River basin, eastern United States. Methods: In this study, we used Lasso-regularized logistic regression (LLR), boosted regression trees (BRT), MaxEnt, and ensemble model (ENS) to evaluate the habitat suitability of 16 fish species with different rarity and temperature preference based on historical species occurrences obtained during 1950-1990. These SDMs were used to make probabilistic predictions of species presence in the independent datasets sampled during 2012-2014. We evaluated the temporal transferability of these SDMs in terms of discrimination power and calibration with the temporarily independent datasets. Results: The area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) was over 0.6 for 13 (81{\%}) of the species in the evaluations of ENS models with the independent datasets. Cool-water species and species with small local population size traits tended to have good temporal transferability. With observed species prevalence as the discrimination cut-off, LLR had the highest overall accuracy for 13 of the 16 species and highest specificity for 10 species, whereas MaxEnt had the highest sensitivity for 14 species. Biases, under- or over-fitting problems were common in the temporal model transfers, among the modelling approaches used here. Main conclusions: SDMs developed with historical data generally had moderate to good discrimination power but they tended to systematically underestimate current probability of species presence. To predict species distribution shifts over time, SDMs should be well-calibrated with high discrimination power. We suggest reclassifying predicted probability of species occurrence to ordinal ranks to deal with (under- and over-estimation) bias, and fine-tuning variable selection with regularization or cross validation to remedy under- and over-fitting. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

The aim of this study was to assess the current and potential distribution of two species of Mexican plum: Spondias purpurea L. and Spondias mombin L. The method applied was ecological niche modeling in Maxent software, which has been used in Mexico with good results. In fieldwork, information on the presence of these species in the country was collected. In addition, environmental variables of biogeographic importance, all with nationwide coverage, were generated. The climate change scenario applied was for the horizon 2075-2099, considering the GFDL-CM3, HADGEM2-ES, and Ensamble REA models, all under RCP 8.5 W{\textperiodcentered}m-2 scenarios. Distribution models were validated by four concordance indices. The most important environmental factors for modeling Spondias spp. were thermal oscillation, low temperatures and precipitation in some months of the year. In the reference scenario, suitability for plums was found in 3.8 and 6.6 {\%} of the country for S. purpurea and S. mombin, respectively. With climate change scenarios at the national level, S. mombin recorded a 13.3 {\%} decrease in suitability growing areas, while S. purpurea recorded a 5.7 {\%} drop.},

abstract = {Introduced into Europe during the Bronze- and Iron Ages as an exotic, non-native species, very little is currently understood about the origins and spread of early domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus. Ecological niche modelling of extant Red Junglefowl, Gallus gallus, presents a unique opportunity to examine historical ecological implications associated with its descendant, the chicken, in early stages of domestication. We model the environmental conditions associated with Red Junglefowl populations both in south-east Asia, where the bird originates, and populations transported further afield as a consequence of human interaction. This allows us to establish the full extent of the ecological tolerance of the ancestor bird. We show that potential for suitable sets of environmental conditions for Red Junglefowl in Europe ranges from poor to limited, based on both current climate and when projecting to mid-Holocene (ca. 4000BCE) climate simulations. This suggests that human intervention played a vital contribution during early domestication to ensure the future widespread success of the chicken. These conclusions offer new insights into the archaeological evidence. We identify areas in the native range as the probable location of first domestication, and not China as has been suggested. We suggest that a dispersal route into Europe via the Mediterranean offers the best ecological potential to aid survival for a recently domesticated version of this species. Identifying the environmental tolerances of Red Junglefowl may also aid future conservation of this species, now highly endangered in its true wild form. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance Cyrtopodium macrobulbon ("ca{\~{n}} averal") has been long used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of painful urinary ailments ("mal de orin") in men. This study was conducted (i) to establish the potential acute toxicity and the antinociceptive activity of some preparations of Cyrtopodium macrobulbon, in order to demonstrate its preclinical efficacy for treating symptoms of "mal de orin"; and (ii) to determine the chemical composition and quality control parameters of this medicinal orchid. Materials and methods The antinociceptive effect was assessed using the acetic acid-induced writhing and the hot-plate tests. Investigation of the acute toxicity was accomplished by the Lorke method. The organic extract (OE) was subjected to conventional phytochemical study using chromatographic conventional procedures. The volatile components profile of the species was accomplished via GC-MS analysis of HS-SPME-adsorbed compounds. Furthermore, an HPLC method to quantify ephemeranthol B (10) was developed and validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines. Microscopic anatomy studies were performed using light and scanning electron microscopies. Finally, a potential distribution map was generated using the MaxEnt modeling method. Results AE and OE were not toxic to mice since the LD50 was higher than 5000 mg/kg. OE was only active in the acetic acid-induced writhing assay at the doses of 100 and 316 mg/kg. Conventional phytochemical analysis of OE led to the isolation and characterization of n-hexacosyl-trans-p-coumarate (1), n-octacosyl-trans-p- coumarate (2), n-triacontyl-trans-p-coumarate (3), 4-methoxy-benzyl alcohol (4), 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (5), 1,5,7-trimethoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene-2,6-diol (6), confusarin (7), gigantol (8), batatasin III (9), and ephemeranthol B (10). The major volatile components identified by HS-SPME analysis were 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone, eucalyptol (11), and isobornyl formate. An HPLC analytical method for the quantification of compound 10 in the plant was developed and fully validated for selectivity, accuracy, and precision. The microscopic studies revealed that the epidermal tissue displayed a layer of enlarged, crenate and cell thin-walled cells with a thickened cuticle; these cells are described for first time for this species. The potential distribution map generated revealed that this species is widespread in Mexico from Sinaloa to Merida states. Conclusions The results of the pharmacological studies tend to support the traditional use of Cyrtopodium macrobulbon for "mal de orin"; the presence of compounds 8, 9, and 11 with known antinociceptive activity might be related with the pharmacological effect demonstrated. The HPLC and microscopic analyses developed in this work will be valuable tools for quality control purposes for this plant. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {It is very common that only presence data are available in ecological niche modeling. However, most existing methods for evaluating the accuracy of presence-absence (binary) predictions of species require presence-absence data. The aim of this study is to present a new method for accuracy assessment that does not rely on absence data. Two new statistics Fpb and Fcpb were derived based on presence-background data. With generated six virtual species, we used DOMAIN, generalized linear modeling (GLM), and maximum entropy (MAXENT) to produce different species presence-absence predictions. To investigate the effectiveness of the new statistics in accuracy assessment, we used Fpb, Fcpb, the traditional F-measure (F), kappa coefficient, true skill statistic (TSS), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the contrast validation index (CVI) to evaluate the accuracy of predictions, and the behaviors of these accuracy measures were compared. The effectiveness of Fpb for threshold selection and estimation of species prevalence was also investigated. Experimental results show that Fcpb is an estimate of F. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (COR) between Fcpb and F is 0.9882, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.0171. In general, Fpb, Fcpb, F, kappa coefficient, TSS, and CVI can sort models by the accuracy of binary prediction, but AUC is not appropriate to evaluate the accuracy of binary prediction. For DOMAIN, GLM, and MAXENT, finding the threshold by maximizing Fpb and by maximizing F result in similar accuracies. In addition, the estimation of species prevalence based on binary output with maximizing Fpb as the thresholding method is significantly more accurate than simply averaging the original continuous output. The best estimate of prevalence is provided by the binary output of MAXENT, with an RMSE of 0.0116. Finally, we conclude that the new method is promising in accuracy assessment, threshold selection, and estimation of species prevalence, all of which are important but challenging problems with presence-only data. Because it does not require absence data, the new method will have important applications in ecological niche modeling. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Habitat loss threatens large mammals worldwide, and their survival will depend on habitat in human-dominated landscapes. Conservation planners thus face the challenge to identify areas of least conflict with land use, yet broadscale species distribution models rarely incorporate real landscape patterns nor do they identify potential conservation conflicts. An excellent example of such conservation challenges is provided by European bison (Bison bonasus). Almost extinct by the early 20th century, bison can only survive in the wild if large metapopulations are established, but it is unclear where new herds can be reintroduced. Using European bison as an example we conducted a continental-scale habitat assessment based on real landscape patterns. Our specific aims here were to (1) map European bison habitat throughout the species' former range, (2) examine whether broadscale habitat suitability factors differ from previously reported fine-scale factors, and (3) assess where suitable habitat occurs in areas with low potential for conflict with land use. We assessed habitat suitability using herd range maps for all 36 free-ranging European bison herds as habitat use data. Habitat suitability maps were compared with maps of land cover, livestock density, agricultural constraints, and protected areas to assess potential conservation conflicts. Our models had high goodness of fit (AUC 1/4 0.941), and we found abundant potential bison habitat. European bison prefer mosaic-type landscapes, with a preference for broad-leaved and mixed forests. European bison metapopulations do not appear to be limited by habitat availability. However, most potential habitat occurred outside protected areas and has substantial potential for conservation conflicts. The most promising areas for establishing large bison metapopulations all occur in Eastern Europe (i.e., the Carpathians, the Belarus- Ukraine borderlands, and several regions in European Russia). The future of European bison and that of other large mammals in the wild thus clearly lies in Eastern Europe, because habitat there is most abundant and least fragmented, and because the potential for conflict with land use is lower. More generally we suggest that broadscale habitat assessments that incorporate land use can be powerful tools for conservation planning and will be key if large herbivore and carnivore conservation is to succeed in a human-dominated world. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Accurate and reliable assessment of bone quality requires predictive methods which could probe bone microstructure and provide information on bone mechanical properties. Multiscale modelling and simulation represent a fast and powerful way to predict bone mechanical properties based on experimental information on bone microstructure as obtained through X-ray-based methods. However, technical limitations of experimental devices used to inspect bone microstructure may produce blurry data, especially in in vivo conditions. Uncertainties affecting the experimental data (input) may question the reliability of the results predicted by the model (output). Since input data are uncertain, deterministic approaches are limited and new modelling paradigms are required. In this paper, a novel stochastic multiscale model is developed to estimate the elastic properties of bone while taking into account uncertainties on bone composition. Effective elastic properties of cortical bone tissue were computed using a multiscale model based on continuum micromechanics. Volume fractions of bone components (collagen, mineral, and water) were considered as random variables whose probabilistic description was built using the maximum entropy principle. The relevance of this approach was proved by analysing a human bone sample taken from the inferior femoral neck. The sample was imaged using synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography. 3-D distributions of Haversian porosity and tissue mineral density extracted from these images supplied the experimental information needed to build the stochastic models of the volume fractions. Thus, the stochastic multiscale model provided reliable statistical information (such as mean values and confidence intervals) on bone elastic properties at the tissue scale. Moreover, the existence of a simpler “nominal model”, accounting for the main features of the stochastic model, was investigated. It was shown that such a model does exist, and its relevance was discussed. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

To do so, we applied the maximum entropy algorithm from the ecological niche modeling program MaxEnt. For each species, we used occurrence records from scientific collections, and published and unpublished sources, and we also used the 19 environmental coverage variables related to precipitation and temperature from WorldClim to develop the models. The predicted distribution of A. pigra was strongly associated with the mean temperature of the warmest quarter (23.6{\%}), whereas the potential distributions of A. palliata and A. geoffroyi were strongly associated with precipitation during the coldest quarter (52.2 and 34.3{\%} respectively). The potential distribution of A. geoffroyi is broader than that of the Alouatta spp. The areas with the greatest probability of presence of A. pigra and A. palliata are strongly associated with riparian vegetation, whereas the presence of A. geoffroyi is more strongly associated with the presence of rain forest. Our most significant contribution is the identification of areas with a high probability of the presence of these primate species, which is information that can be applied to planning future studies and then establishing criteria for the creation of areas to primate conservation in Mexico. {\textcopyright} 2011 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.},

abstract = {Predicting the influence of climate change on the potential distribution of naturalised alien plant species is an important and challenging task. While prioritisation of management actions for alien plants under current climatic conditions has been widely adopted, very few systems explicitly incorporate the potential of future changes in climate conditions to influence the distribution of alien plant species. Here, we develop an Australia-wide screening tool to assess the potential of naturalised alien plants to establish and spread under both current and future climatic conditions. The screening tool developed uses five spatially explicit criteria to establish the likelihood of alien plant population establishment and expansion under baseline climate conditions and future climates for the decades 2035 and 2065. Alien plants are then given a threat rating according to current and future threat to enable natural resource managers to focus on those species that pose the largest potential threat now and in the future. To demonstrate the screening tool, we present results for a representative sample of approximately 10{\%} (n=292) of Australia's known, naturalised alien plant species. Overall, most alien plant species showed decreases in area of habitat suitability under future conditions compared to current conditions and therefore the threat rating of most alien plant species declined between current and future conditions. Use of the screening tool is intended to assist natural resource managers in assessing the threat of alien plant establishment and spread under current and future conditions and thus prioritise detailed weed risk assessments for those species that pose the greatest threat. The screening tool is associated with a searchable database for all 292 alien plant species across a range of spatial scales, available through an interactive web-based portal at http://weedfutures.net/. {\textcopyright} 2015.},

Precipitation and temperature contribute equally to model building of the genotypes based on the 28S rDNA gene. In regard to the mtDNA gene region, precipitation is the most important factor in modelling the CtCmt1 haplotype range, while temperature appears to be the most important factor in modelling the CtCmt2.1 and CtCmt2.2 haplotype ranges.

abstract = {One common problem with geographic data is that, for a specific geographic event, only occurrence information is available; information about the absence of the event is not available.We refer to these specific types of geospatial data as geographic one-class data (GOCD). Predicting the potential spatial distributions that a particular geographic event may occur from GOCD is difficult because traditional binary classification methods that require availability of both positive and negative training samples cannot be used. The objective of this research is to define GOCD and propose novel approaches for modelling potential spatial distributions of geographic events using GOCD. We investigate the effectiveness of one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), maximum entropy (MAXENT) and the newly proposed positive and unlabelled learning (PUL) algorithm for solving GOCD problems using a case study: species distribution modelling from synthetic data. Our experimental results indicate that generally OCSVM, MAXENT and PUL are effective in modelling the GOCD. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, but PUL seems to be the most promising method. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Identifying the species most vulnerable to extinction as a result of climate change is a necessary first step in mitigating biodiversity decline. Species distribution modeling (SDM) is a commonly used tool to assess potential climate change impacts on distributions of species.We use SDMs to predict geographic ranges for 243 birds of Australian tropical savannas, and to project changes in species richness and ranges under a future climate scenario between 1990 and 2080. Realistic predictions require recognition of the variability in species capacity to track climatically suitable environments. Here we assess the effect of dispersal on model results by using three approaches: full dispersal, no dispersal and a partial-dispersal scenario permitting species to track climate change at a rate of 30 km per decade. As expected, the projected distributions and richness patterns are highly sensitive to the dispersal scenario. Projected future range sizes decreased for 66{\%} of species if full dispersal was assumed, but for 89{\%} of species when no dispersal was assumed. However, realistic future predictions should not assume a single dispersal scenario for all species and as such, we assigned each species to the most appropriate dispersal category based on individual mobility and habitat specificity; this permitted the best estimates of where species will be in the future. Under this "realistic" dispersal scenario, projected ranges sizes decreased for 67{\%} of species but showed that migratory and tropical-endemic birds are predicted to benefit from climate change with increasing distributional area. Richness hotspots of tropical savanna birds are expected to move, increasing in southern savannas and southward along the east coast of Australia, but decreasing in the arid zone. Understanding the complexity of effects of climate change on species' range sizes by incorporating dispersal capacities is a crucial step toward developing adaptation policies for the conservation of vulnerable species. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.},

abstract = {Elephant inhabiting arid and semi-arid savannas often experience periods of drought, which, if prolonged, may cause mortality. During dry periods, elephant aggregate around water sources and deplete local forage availability. However, the relationships between adult elephant mortality and both high local elephant density and forage availability close to water during dry periods remain unexplored. We hypothesized that elephant mortality is higher: a) when dry periods are longer, b) closer to water points, and c) in areas with higher local elephant density. Using nine years of elephant carcass data from Tsavo Conservation Area in Kenya, we analysed the probability of adult elephant mortality using maximum entropy modelling (MaxEnt). We found that elephant carcasses were aggregated and elephant mortality was negatively correlated with four months cumulative precipitation prior to death (which contributed 41{\%} to the model), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (19{\%}) and distance to water (6{\%}), while local elephant density (19{\%}) showed a positive correlation. Three seasons (long dry, short dry and short wet seasons) showed high probability of elephant mortality, whereas low probability was found during long wet seasons. Our results strongly suggest that elephants starve to death in prolonged drought. Artificial water holes may lead to lower mortality, but also to larger populations with subsequent high browsing pressure on the vegetation. Our results suggest that elephant populations in arid and semi-arid savannas appear to be regulated by drought-induced mortalities, which may be the best way of controlling elephant numbers without having to cull. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {MaxEnt is one of the most widely used tools in ecology, biogeography, and evolution for modeling and mapping species distributions using presence-only occurrence records and associated environmental covariates. Despite its popularity, the exponential model implemented by MaxEnt does not directly estimate occurrence probability, the natural quantity of interest when modeling species distributions. Instead, MaxEnt generates an index of relative habitat suitability. MaxLike, a newly introduced maximum-likelihood technique, has been shown to overcome the problem of directly estimating the probability of occurrence using presence-only data. However, the performance and relative merits of MaxEnt and MaxLike remain largely untested, especially when modeling species with relatively few occurrence data that encompass only a portion of the geographic range of the species. Using georeferenced occurrence records for six species of ants in New England, we provide comparisons of MaxEnt and MaxLike. We show that by most quantitative metrics, the performance of MaxLike exceeds that of MaxEnt, regardless of whether MaxEnt models account for sampling bias and include greater model complexity than implemented in MaxLike. More importantly, for most species, the relative suitability index estimated by MaxEnt often was poorly correlated with the probability of occurrence estimated by MaxLike, suggesting that the two methods are estimating different quantities. For species distribution modeling, MaxLike, and similar models that are based on an explicit sampling process and that directly estimate probability of occurrence, should be considered as important alternatives to the widely-used MaxEnt framework. {\textcopyright} 2013 Fitzpatrick et al.},

During March to May of 2009-2011, we conducted call-playback surveys to assess the status of the species within a wide range of wetland habitats of the central Delta region. We detected black rails at 21 of 107 discrete wetland sites, primarily on in-channel islands with dense cover. To better understand the habitat and land cover characteristics, we developed a model of habitat suitability from these occurrence data and a fine-scale vegetation and land use dataset using MaxEnt. We also evaluated differences in the size of wetlands at sites where black rails were detected versus where they were not. Through surveys and quantitative modeling, we found black rail presence differed from other regions within California and Arizona, in that it was positively associated with tall (1 to 5 m) emergent vegetation interspersed with riparian shrubs. Specific plants correlated with black rail presence included emergent wetland (Bolboschoenus acutus, B. californicus, B. acutus, Typha angustifolia, T. latifolia, Phragmites australis) and riparian (Salix exigua, S. lasiolepis, Rosa californica, Rubus discolor, Cornus sericea) species. Median patch size was significantly larger and perimeter-to-area ratios were significantly lower at wetland sites where black rails were found. These results provide a preliminary characterization of black rail habitat in the Delta region and highlight the need for better understanding of this listed species' population size and habitat use in the region, in light of anticipated climate change effects and proposed large-scale restoration in the Delta. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the article author(s).},

abstract = {Aquatic invasive species are a growing concern to environmental managers because of their diverse impacts on aquatic biodiversity and high eradication costs, necessitating effective management policies. In this study, we evaluate the ability of environmental and socio-economic factors to predict the risk of invasion in Great Britain and Ireland of 12 potential aquatic invaders covering all major aquatic groups. Despite their potential to inform risk assessments, this is the first time socio-economic factors related to propagule pressure have been specifically integrated in distribution modelling. Species distribution models (SDM, MaxEnt algorithm) were calibrated with a set of environmental factors (e.g. bioclimatic, geographical and geological) and integrated with socio-economic (e.g. human influence index, population density, closeness to ports) predictors. The inclusion of socio-economic factors in SDM did not affect accuracy scores (AUC already {\textgreater}0{\textperiodcentered}90), but their effects were more pronounced in spatial predictions, resulting in up to a sixfold amplification of the area predicted suitable for each species. Despite the inclusion of potential surrogates of water chemistry (e.g. geology) and propagule pressure (e.g. population density), temperature-related variables were most important predictors of aquatic species' distributions. According to SDM, the environmental suitability for a suite of invaders belonging to different taxonomic groups and regions of origin is greatest in east and south-east England and decreases towards the north and west. Multiple invasions in this region are of special concern, as species are known to modify their habitat facilitating subsequent invasions, thereby potentially exacerbating their impacts. Major management regions to be prioritized in monitoring programmes include the Humber, Thames and Anglian River Basin Districts. Species of special concern include a mysid (Hemimysis anomala), a gammarid (Dikerogammarus villosus), a plant (Ludwigia grandiflora) and two crayfishes (Procambarus clarkii and P. fallax). Synthesis and Applications. The inclusion of socio-economic factors in species distribution models has the potential to improve predictions of areas under a highest risk of multiple invasions and to help disentangle the complex interplay between biological invasions and global environmental and socio-economic processes. Such understanding is pivotal to prioritize limited resources for the optimum prevention and control of biological invasions. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

The spatial distribution of freshwater snail intermediate hosts involved in the transmission of schistosomiasis, fascioliasis and paramphistomiasis (i.e. Bulinus globosus, Biomphalaria pfeifferi and Lymnaea natalensis) were modelled by the use of a maximum entropy algorithm (Maxent). Two snail observation datasets from Zimbabwe, from 1988 and 2012, were compared in terms of geospatial distribution and potential distributional change over this 24-year period investigated. Climate data, from the two years were identified and used in a species distribution modelling framework to produce maps of predicted suitable snail habitats. Having both climate- and snail observation data spaced 24 years in time represent a unique opportunity to evaluate biological response of snails to changes in climate variables. The study shows that snail habitat suitability is highly variable in Zimbabwe with foci mainly in the central Highveld but also in areas to the South and West. It is further demonstrated that the spatial distribution of suitable habitats changes with variation in the climatic conditions, and that this parallels that of the predicted climate change.},

abstract = {Culex tritaeniorhynchus is the primary vector of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) throughout much of the tropical and temperate climates of Asia. Several recent papers have used ecological niche modeling programs, e.g., Maxent and GARP, to predict the distribution of disease vectors (e.g. Peterson and Shaw 2003, Moffett et al. 2007). In this on-going study, we used the Maxent program to model the distribution of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus in the Republic of Korea. Using mosquito collection data, temperature, precipitation, elevation, land cover, and SPOT normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), models were created for each month for a period of five years. Output maps from the models matched several known ecological characteristics of this species' distribution. The output maps show the highest probabilities of mosquito occurrence in August and September, which correlates to the observed mosquito population density peaks. The model demonstrated low probabilities for forest covered mountains, which corresponds to findings in the literature that Cx. tritaeniorhynchus is infrequently found above 1,000 meters. The modeling effort demonstrated several limitations in the data set, including a low number of collection sites that did not cover the full range of environmental conditions within the study area. Additional collection sites would improve the models and allow for improved testing of the results. Future goals of this project include developing real-time predictions based on NDVI data and expanding the prediction to a larger geographical area.},

abstract = {Aim: To evaluate the relative importance of environmental factors relevant to specific hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the distribution of social and subsocial Anelosimus spiders in the American continent and Ecuador. For social species, we test the seasonality and prey size hypotheses, which posit that species forming long-lived multifemale colonies require aseasonal conditions and warm and productive environments in which large insects can develop. For subsocial species, we test the rain intensity and predation risk hypotheses, which posit that species whose colonies contain a single female and her offspring cannot occupy areas where strong rains cause frequent damage to their webs and where warm temperatures and high productivity promote greater predation. Location: America, Ecuador. Methods: Using generalized linear models, hierarchical variance partitioning, Maxent distribution modelling and phylogenetically controlled regressions, we analysed the relative importance of environmental variables that either directly or indirectly relate to these non-exclusive hypotheses - temperature and precipitation seasonality (seasonality hypothesis), annual temperature and net primary productivity (insect size and predation hypotheses) and rain intensity (rain intensity hypothesis). Results: Temperature seasonality, followed by annual temperature and rain intensity, were the most important predictors of the distribution of spider sociality across America, whereas temperature and rain intensity predominated in the largely aseasonal Ecuador. In general, social species were associated with lower temperature seasonality, warmer temperatures and higher rain intensity than subsocial species. Main conclusion: The association of social Anelosimus with warm and wet areas in the tropics is consistent with both the seasonality and prey size hypotheses, i.e. both aseasonal conditions and warm temperatures, which allow large insects to develop, are needed for large social colonies to form. That subsocial Anelosimus drop-out from tropical areas with warm temperatures and high rain intensity is consistent with the hypotheses that high predation risk and disturbance by strong rains exclude subsocial Anelosimus from the lowland rain forest. {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {There is an urgent recognized need for conservation of tropical forest deer. In order to identify some environmental factors affecting conservation, we analyzed the seasonal habitat use of two Indonesian deer species, Axis kuhlii in Bawean Island and Muntiacus muntjak in south-western Java Island, in response to several physical, climatic, biological, and anthropogenic variables. Camera trapping was performed in different habitat types during both wet and dry season to record these elusive species. The highest number of photographs was recorded in secondary forest and during the dry season for both Bawean deer and red muntjac. In models, anthropogenic and climatic variables were the main predictors of habitat use. Distances to cultivated area and to settlement were the most important for A. kuhlii in the dry season. Distances to cultivated area and annual rainfall were significant for M. muntjak in both seasons. Then we modelled their predictive range using Maximum entropy modelling (Maxent). We concluded that forest landscape is the fundamental scale for deer management, and that secondary forests are potentially important landscape elements for deer conservation. Important areas for conservation were identified accounting of habitat transformation in both study areas. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS},

The aims are to compare the distribution and richness of species within the protected areas, assessing the degree of protection and gap analysis of reserves for this group. We used the Maxent algorithm with environmental and occurrence data, and produced geographic distribution maps. The results show that high species richness occurs in forest and coastal forest of Esp{\'{i}}rito Santo to Bahia states. The endemic species comprise D. flexuosa, D. macrocarpa, D. flexuosa, D. grandifolia, and D. sessilifolia. In the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil, the following endemic species occur: D. tintinnabulata and D. glaziovii, with this latter species being included in the "red list" due habitat loss and predatory extractivism. The indicators of species richness in the coastal region of Bahia correspond with floristic inventories that point to this area having a high biodiversity. Although this region has several protected areas, there are gaps in reserves, which, combined with anthropogenic threats and fragmentation, have caused several problems for biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Ismael Martins Pereira et al.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach of population genetics together with environmental and biogeographic data leading to inferences for ecological niche modelling. We used hierarchical lineages obtained using the nested cladistic analysis (NCA) of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes of the bark beetle species Tomicus destruens, for modelling the distribution by maximum entropy using environmental and host variables along the whole Mediterranean Basin. The identity and similarity tests were checked in the intraspecific lineages (NCA clades and haplotypes) in order to determine a shift or conservatism niche between them. Also, four indices from nine geographical areas in the Mediterranean Basin were calculated to assess the variability of environmental factors shaping the distribution of haplotype diversity on a large geographic scale. The ecological models developed indicate that minority eastern mtDNA lineages of T. destruens differ in their potential ecological niche according to their relation to extreme climatic variables. By contrast, the most widespread western lineages display a close relationship with their Pinus host tree. Also, higher levels of exclusive and endemic haplotypes were predicted in areas with high temperature variability in the Mediterranean wet period. The eastern group niche seems to be included in part of the range of the ecological space of the two major western clades. This result suggests that a niche shift might have started, being still an early relationship with its host tree Pinus brutia. Alternatively, the temperature variability in the wettest period appears to be related to a high proportion of endemic haplotypes of T. destruens, possibly by involving a balance between the length of the flight reproductive period of T. destruens and the status of the host tree vigour and growth stage. This study illustrates a good example of the benefits that ecological niche modelling provides to understand population genetic and phylogeographic patterns. {\textcopyright} 2014, Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r Biologische Systematik.},

abstract = {Bacillus anthracis is the pathogenic bacterium that causes anthrax, which dwells in soils as highly resilient endospores. B. anthracis spore viability in soil is dependent upon environmental conditions, but the soil properties necessary for spore survival are unclear. In this study we used a range of soil geochemical and physical parameters to predict the spatial distribution of B. anthracis in northwest Minnesota, where 64 cases of anthrax in livestock were reported from 2000 to 2013. Two modeling approaches at different spatial scales were used to identify the soil conditions most correlated to known anthrax cases using both statewide and locally collected soil data. Ecological niche models were constructed using the Maximum Entropy (Maxent) approach and included 11 soil parameters as environmental inputs and recorded anthrax cases as known presences. One ecological niche model used soil data and anthrax presences for the entire state while a second model used locally sampled soil data (n = 125) and a subset of anthrax presences, providing a test of spatial scale. In addition, simple logistic regression models using the localized soil data served as an independent measure of variable importance. Maxent model results indicate that at a statewide level, soil calcium and magnesium concentrations, soil pH, and sand content are the most important properties for predicting soil suitability for B. anthracis while at the local level, clay and sand content along with phosphorous and strontium concentrations are most important. These results also show that the spatial scale of analysis is important when considering soil parameters most important for B. anthracis spores. For example, at a broad scale, B. anthracis spores may require Ca-rich soils and an alkaline pH, but may also concentrate in microenvironments with high Sr concentrations. The study is also one of the first ecological niche models that demonstrates the major importance of soil texture for defining the ecological niche of B. anthracis. These results will help improve our understanding of the soil geochemical conditions most suitable for B. anthracis as well as more reliably identify areas where anthrax may be found to focus prevention and remediation efforts. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Climate change is recognized as a major threat to biodiversity. Multidisciplinary approaches that combine population genetics and species distribution modelling to assess these threats and recommend conservation actions are critical but rare. Combined, these methods provide independent verification and a more compelling case for developing conservation actions. This study integrates these data streams together with field assessments and spatial analyses to develop future genetic resource management recommendations. The study species was Callistemon teretifolius (Needle Bottlebrush), a shrub species endemic to the Mount Lofty and Flinders Ranges, South Australia, and potentially vulnerable to climate change. Chloroplast microsatellite and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism data were combined with species distribution modelling (MaxEnt), spatial analysis and field assessment to evaluate climate change vulnerability. Two major genetic groups were identified (Mount Lofty and Flinders Ranges). Populations in the Flinders Ranges, especially the Southern Flinders Ranges exhibited the highest genetic diversity, indicating a possible genetic refugium. Lower genetic diversity to the south in the Mount Lofty Ranges and north in the Gammon Ranges may be due to post-glacial expansion into these areas from the Flinders Ranges or loss of alleles. Low levels of contemporary gene flow were identified, which suggests Callistemon teretifolius may have a limited capacity to respond to climate change through migration. Range restrictions were predicted for all future climates, especially in the north. It is likely that C.teretifolius will be adversely affected by climate change, due to limited gene flow, predicted range restriction and loss of suitable habitat. The Southern Flinders Ranges should be a priority for conservation because it contains the highest number of individuals and genetic diversity. We recommend monitoring and adaptive management involving restoration in the Southern Flinders Ranges, potentially incorporating genetic translocations from other areas to capture diversity, to assist C.teretifolius to adapt to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

Gypsophytes, plants that live on gypsum soil outcrops, are one group of edaphic endemic plants about which information on localities and habitat requirements is needed. An opportunity to provide some protection to gypsophyte species in White River Valley, Nevada, arose with the revision of Ely BLM's Resource Management Plan. Field surveys to gather locality data were performed in 2005 and 2007, and 1840 new localities were identified. Species distribution modeling can be a useful tool for delineating areas for special management to benefit species of concern. Species distribution model inputs included gypsophyte localities, elevation, slope, aspect, and remotely sensed data on probability of gypsum springmound occurrence. Model outputs were refined using field surveys, and four sites with gypsum springmounds with BLM sensitive-status gypsophytes for Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) status were proposed. These four sites have since been designated, and provide some degree of protection to gypsophytes, though the scattered, isolated nature of gypsum springmounds and other edaphic endemic plant habitats highlights the importance of the use of rare plant locality point data, as well as remotely sensed data and field surveys by land management agency staff in carrying out National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) planning for projects that have the potential to harm rare plant populations.},

These data are often not available for less developed areas, or may be at an inappropriate scale, and thus to obtain this information requires fieldwork. An alternative source of eco-geographical data comes from satellite imagery. Three sets of ENM were calculated exclusively with variables obtained (1) from optical and radar images only and (2) from climatic and altitude maps obtained by ground-based methods. These models were compared to evaluate whether satellite imagery can accurately generate ENM. These comparisons must be made in areas with well-known species distribution and with available satellite imagery and ground-based data. Thus, the study area was the south-western part of Salamanca (Spain), using amphibian and reptiles as species models. Models' discrimination capacity was measured with ROC plots. Models' covariation was measured with a Spatial Spearman correlation. Four modelling techniques were used (Bioclim, Mahalanobis distance, GARP and Maxent). The results of this comparison showed that there were no significant differences between models generated using remotely sensed imagery or ground-based data. However, the models built with satellite imagery data exhibited a larger diversity of values, probably related to the higher spatial resolution of the satellite imagery. Satellite imagery can produce accurate ENM, independently of the modelling technique or the dataset used. Therefore, biogeographical analysis of species distribution in remote areas can be accurately developed only with variables from satellite imagery. {\textcopyright} Firenze University Press.},

This technique has been widely employed with modern organisms, and great potential exists for ENM studies in the fossil record. By modelling a species' niche during multiple time slices, the relative degree of niche conservatism or niche evolution a species undergoes during intervals of biotic, environmental, or climatic change can be assessed. In this case study, the relative stability of ecological niches of eight Late Ordovician (Katian) brachiopods from the Cincinnati Arch of eastern North America is assessed across an extra-basinal immigration event, the Richmondian Invasion. This framework provides an opportunity to examine whether species altered the parameters of their ecological niches more in response to species invasions and ecosystem turnover or during gradual environmental changes preceding the invasion event. Niches were modelled for nine time slices spanning the interval before, during, and after the invasion using the Maxent program based on environmental parameters estimated from the sedimentary record including: inferred water depth, lithology, bedding thickness, bedding style and physical sedimentary structures. Niche stability was assessed through pairwise comparisons of the percent contribution of each environmental parameter to species' niche models between adjacent time slices. Bray-Curtis similarity among environmental contributions to species niche models through time varied. Species exhibited low similarity (niche evolution) prior to the onset of the Richmondian Invasion, but high similarity (niche stability) during the invasion interval. Similarity levels (niche stability) relax post-invasion, although similarity values still significantly exceed pre-invasion levels. Cincinnatian brachiopod species which successfully persist through the invasion, therefore, appear to have responded to invasion pressure through niche conservatism.},

The current spatial distribution of such a pest depends on two main factors: the current environmental conditions in which it can survive; and, its ability to occupy those environments by dispersal, which can be inferred from phylogeography and population genetics. These indicate that all OWS flies in Indonesia have mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) haplotypes of the Asian lineage, and the regional separation of its four sub-lineages is the result of infrequent long-distance dispersal. We report the first investigation to associate regional cyt b sub-lineages of the OWS fly with environmental variables. Principal Components Analysis was used to demonstrate that these sub-lineages are associated with very similar macro-climates throughout Indonesia. Then, a species distribution model for the OWS fly in Indonesia was obtained by using the Maxent program. This indicated that elevation captured information not given by other environmental variables, and cattle density provided the most useful information by itself.

We identified IBB cores to be used as termini for modelled corridors.

We used MaxEnt on 101 spatially independent presence points to map areas of high-quality habitat. The largest population patch (approx. 8,700 km2) covered 4 protected areas. We used least-cost modelling to model habitat corridors among 31 habitat cores. We considered a corridor locally important if it helped join nearby cores into a cluster that would support a large demographically and genetically vigorous population. We considered a corridor regionally important if it could connect the clusters united by local corridors. The most important local corridors were the corridors creating 4 clusters in the southeast of Iran. Also, we identified the 2 important regional corridors that could connect the 3 most important clusters. Although the density of roads in all habitat corridors was low (18.51 m/km2), roads crossed many important corridors.

abstract = {Because of the current shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy sources, it is necessary to plan for the installation of new infrastructure to meet the demand for clean energy. Traditional methods for determining wind turbine site suitability suffer from the selection of arbitrary criteria and model parameters by experts, which may lead to a degree of uncertainty in the models produced. An alternative empirically based methodology for building a wind turbine siting model for the state of Iowa is presented in the study. We employ 'ecological niche' principles traditionally utilized to model species allocation to develop a new multicriteria, spatially explicit framework for wind turbine placement. Using information on suitability conditions at existing turbine locations, we incorporate seven variables (wind speed, elevation, slope, land cover, distance of infrastructure and settlements, and population density) into two machine-learning algorithms [maximum entropy method (Maxent) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Prediction (GARP)] to model suitable areas for installation of wind turbines. The performance of this method is tested at the statewide level and a six-county region in western Iowa. Maxent and GARP identified areas in the Northwest and North Central regions of Iowa as the optimum location for new wind turbines. Information on variable contributions from Maxent illuminates the relative importance of environmental variables and its scale-dependent nature. It also allows validating existing assumptions about the relationship between variables and wind turbine suitability. The resultant models demonstrate high levels of accuracy and suggest that the presented approach is a possible methodology for developing wind turbine siting applications.

abstract = {Twenty six accessions of bottle gourd germplasm comprising 14 accessions of cultivated and 12 accessions of wild germplasm were collected from 23 agro-ecological niches covering 14 districts in Maharashtra region. The collected germplasm exhibited very interesting variation in the qualitative characters of fruits such as shape, luster, blossom end, ridges etc. Six types of fruit shape were recorded among the wild bottle gourd germplasm viz., Dumbell, elongate, elliptic, globular, goose neck and pyriform while four types (curved, elongate, globular and pyriform) recorded among cultivated edible types. Wide range of variability were recorded in the quantitative traits for several fruit and seed characters, viz., fruit length (10.8-69.4 cm.), perimeter of the fruits (23.5-64.5 cm), green fruits weight (102.05-1852.69 g), seed length (1.47-1.64 cm), seed width (0.47- 0.66 cm) and 100 seed weight (9.92-21.94 g) in cultivated germplasm while in thewild germplasm the fruit length ranges from (14.2-31.8 cm), perimeter of the fruit (29.7-57.6 cm), green fruit weight (538.23-1593.26 g), seed length (1.34-1.66 cm), seed width (0.46-0.62 cm) and 100 seed weight (12.60-16.76 g). The qualitative and quantitative traits expressed fairly a good spectrum of fruits diversity in Maharashtra for its cultivated and wild relatives. In order to discover distribution of cultivated and wild forms in the current climate change regime, Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling was performed and the models presented in for wild and cultivated forms, respectively. The generated models were compared with Ecocrop model, a component of DIVA-GIS for the suitability cultivation of useful bottle gourd germplasm and identifying potential regions for its on-farm conservation. The present investigation helped in preparing a comprehensive map on the existence of diversity/variability and also provided a fairly good idea on cultivated and wild relatives' diversity in the state of Maharashtra.},

abstract = {The distribution of the planktivorous basking shark Cetorhinus maximus is influenced by zooplankton abundance at small scales and temperature at medium scales in the North Atlantic. Here, we estimate the distribution of basking sharks on South Atlantic continental shelves, and the relative importance of chlorophyll concentration, as a proxy for zooplankton abundance, and temperature in determining habitat suitability for basking sharks at large scales. We used maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and maximum likelihood (MaxLike) species distribution modelling to test three hypotheses: the distribution of basking sharks is determined by (1) temperature, (2) chlorophyll concentration, or (3) both chlorophyll and temperature, while considering other factors, such as oxygen and salinity. Off South America, basking shark habitat included subtropical, temperate and cool-temperate waters between approximately 20°S and 55°S. Off Africa, basking shark habitat was limited to cool-temperate waters off Namibia and southern South Africa. MaxLike models had a better fit than MaxEnt models. The best model included minimum chlorophyll concentration, dissolved oxygen concentration, and sea surface temperature range, supporting hypothesis 3. However, of all variables included in the best model, minimum chlorophyll concentration had the highest influence on basking shark distribution. Unlike the North Atlantic distribution, the South Atlantic distribution of basking sharks includes subtropical and cool-temperate waters. This difference is explained by high minimum chlorophyll concentration off southern Brazil as compared to North Atlantic subtropical areas. Observations in other regions of the world support this conclusion. The highest habitat suitability for basking sharks is located close to nearshore areas that experience high anthropogenic impact. {\textcopyright} 2015 Current Zoology.},

abstract = {The potential distribution of Olea ferruginea was predicted by Maxent model for present and the upcoming hypothetical (2050) climatic scenario. O. ferruginea is an economically beneficial plant species. For predicting the potential distribution of O. ferruginea in Pakistan, Worldclim variables for current and future climatic change scenarios, digital elevation model (DEM) slope, and aspects with the occurrence point were used. Pearson correlation was used to reject highly correlated variables. A total of 219 sighting points were used in the Maxent modeling. The area under curve (AUC) value was higher than 0.98. The approach used in this study is considered useful in predicting the potential distribution of O. ferruginea species, and can be an effective tool in the conservation and restoration planning for human welfare. The results show that there is a significant impact under future bioclimatic scenarios on the potential distribution of O. ferruginea in Pakistan. There is a significant decrease in the overall distribution of O. ferruginea due to loss of habitats under current distribution range, but this will be compensated by gain of habitat at higher altitudes in the future climate change scenario (habitat shift). It is recommended that the areas predicted suitable for the O. ferruginea may be used for plantation of this species while the deforested land should be restored for human welfare. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {The main goal of this study was to predict, through the use of GIS tool as ecological niche modelling, potentially suitable ecological niche and defining the conditions of such niche for the representatives of the cosmopolitan genus Sirthenea. Among all known genera of the subfamily Peiratinae, only Sirthenea occurs on almost all continents and zoogeographical regions. Our research was based on 521 unique occurrence localities and a set of environmental variables covering the whole world. Based on occurrence localities, as well as climatic variables, digital elevation model, terrestrial ecoregions and biomes, information about the ecological preferences is given. Potentially useful ecological niches were modelled using Maxent software, which allowed for the creation of a map of the potential distribution and for determining climatic preferences. An analysis of climatic preferences suggested that the representatives of the genus were linked mainly to the tropical and temperate climates. An analysis of ecoregions also showed that they preferred areas with tree vegetation like tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biomes as well as temperate broadleaf and mixed forest biomes. Therefore, on the basis of the museum data on the species occurrence and ecological niche modelling method, we provided new and valuable information on the potentially suitable habitat and the possible range of distribution of the genus Sirthenea along with its climatic preferences. {\textcopyright} 2015 Ch{\l}ond, Bugaj-Nawrocka This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

abstract = {Aim: To demonstrate the application of predictive species distribution modelling methods to habitat mapping and assessment of percentage area-based conservation targets. Location: The NE Atlantic deep sea (UK and Irish extended continental shelf limits). Methods: MaxEnt modelling of three listed habitats (Lophelia pertusa (Linnaeus, 1758) reef (LpReef), Pheronema carpenteri (WyvilleThomson, 1869) aggregations (PcAggs) and Syringammina fragilissima (Brady, 1883) aggregations (SfAggs)), with some pre-selection of variables by generalized additive modelling. Models are validated using repeated 70/30 build/test data splits using AUC and threshold-dependent assessment methods. Predicted distribution maps are used to assess the adequacy of existing area closures for the protection of listed habitats and to assess percentage representation of each community within existing MPA networks. Results: Model performances are rated as fair (LpReef), excellent (PcAggs) and good (SfAggs). Current closures are focused on the protection of cold-water coral reef and incidentally capture some SfAggs suitable environments, but largely fail to protect PcAggs. Considering the wider network of MPAs in the study region, approximately 23{\%} (LpReef), 2{\%} (PcAggs) and 6{\%} (SfAggs) of the area predicted as suitable for each habitat respectively is contained within an MPA. Main conclusions: To date, decisions on area closures for the protection of 'listed' deep-sea habitats have been based on maps of recorded presence of species that are taken as being indicative of that habitat. Predictive habitat modelling may provide a useful method of better estimating the extent of listed habitats, providing direction for future MPA establishment and a means of assessing MPA network effectiveness against politically set percentage targets. Given the coarse resolution of the model, percentages should be taken as maximal figures, with habitat occurrence likely to be less prevalent in reality. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim To investigate relative niche stability in species responses to various types of environmental pressure (biotic and abiotic) on geological time-scales using the fossil record. Location The case study focuses on Late Ordovician articulate brachiopods of the Cincinnati Arch in eastern North America. Methods Species niches were modelled for a suite of fossil brachiopod species based on five environmental variables inferred from sedimentary parameters using GARP and Maxent. Niche stability was assessed by comparison of (1) the degree of overlap of species distribution models developed for a time-slice and those generated by projecting niche models of the previous time-slice onto environmental layers of a second time-slice using GARP and Maxent, (2) Schoener's D statistic, and (3) the similarity of the contribution of each environmental parameter within Maxent niche models between adjacent time-slices. Results Late Ordovician brachiopod species conserved their niches with high fidelity during intervals of gradual environmental change but responded to inter-basinal species invasions through niche evolution. Both native and invasive species exhibited similar levels of niche evolution in the invasion and post-invasion intervals. Niche evolution was related mostly to decreased variance within the former ecological niche parameters rather than to shifts to new ecospace. Main conclusions Although the species examined exhibited morphological stasis during the study interval, high levels of niche conservatism were observed only during intervals of gradual environmental change. Rapid environmental change, notably inter-basinal species invasions, resulted in high levels of niche evolution among the focal taxa. Both native and invasive species responded with similar levels of niche evolution during the invasion interval and subsequent environmental reorganization. The assumption of complete niche conservatism frequently employed in ecological niche modelling (ENM) analyses to forecast or hindcast species geographical distributions is more likely to be accurate for climate change studies than for invasive species analyses over geological time-scales. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim: The aims of this study were (1) to assess the spatial distribution of orchid species richness in New Guinea, and (2) to examine patterns of species turnover in the orchid community through phytogeographical regionalization. We aimed to achieve these goals using botanical collection records, species distribution models (SDMs) and partitioning around medoids (PAM) clustering. Location: New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago and surrounding islands. Methods: We combined 6760 collection records of 532 orchid species with 16 uncorrelated environmental predictor variables, to model species distributions at 5 arc-min resolution, using the presence-only modelling algorithm, Maxent. All SDMs were tested for significant deviation from random expectation using bias-corrected null models. The results from significant SDMs were stacked to create a map of orchid species richness. The same significant SDMs were used to derive phytogeographical regions through a PAM cluster analysis. Results: Of the 532 modelled species distributions, 283 showed significantly stronger correlation with environmental conditions than expected by chance alone. It is inferred that the central mountain ranges of eastern New Guinea, including part of the Papuan Peninsula, harbour the highest levels of orchid species richness. The study area was divided into eight phytogeographical regions that maximized internal community similarity among orchids. Two of these regions are found almost exclusively in western New Guinea, while the remainder are more evenly distributed. Main conclusions: Our study provides an objective assessment of the distribution of relative orchid species richness in New Guinea. The eight derived phytogeographical regions are largely consistent with existing knowledge of the island's internal biogeography. These findings give insight into one of the global hotspots of orchid diversity, and improve our understanding of the phytogeography of New Guinea. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Ecologists often wish to describe mathematical relationships between response variables and climate covariates in spatial models of species distribution; these relationships are commonly termed climate envelopes. There are many situations when the functional form of the envelopes should be either unimodal or monotonic, but current practice tends towards the use of either low-degree single-variable spline curves fitted as part of a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) or piecewise linear forms in software such as maxent. We argue that such curves are often inappropriate, as they: (i) can easily produce relationships which are ecologically implausible and (ii) frequently ignore interactions between multiple climate variables in a general regression context. We propose an novel alternative parametric form for climate envelopes that appeals to ecological plausibility and can encompass realistic features of species' presence/climate relationships on several variables simultaneously. The proposed plateau climate envelope function is applied via a spatial Bayesian species distribution model to data on two European tree species to demonstrate the approach. For Fagus sylvatica, a complete climate envelope is estimable, but for Quercus coccifera, only a partial climate envelope can be estimated as the geographical extent of the data set does not cover the full environmental niche for the species. We show that such an approach is practical, produces climate envelopes with an ecologically meaningful form and furthermore allows the inclusion of information external to the data set being analysed. We discuss the use of this new plateau climate envelope function in the context of ecological niche modelling and argue that in some instances ecological realism should be regarded as more important than the use of formal model comparison statistics. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

Mexico's 'ortion of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC-M) is located in one of the main strongholds for Bairds tapir. To assess the MBC-M's effectiveness for tapir conservation, we estimated the distribution of the species' potential habitat by applying 2 modelling approaches (random forest and Maxent) to a set of uncorrelated environmental variables and a 157-point presence dataset. We calculated the extent of tapir habitat in within the MBC-M and modelled new corridors and conservation areas, which we compared to the MBC-M. Moreover, we assessed deforestation patterns in the region. Twenty-seven percent of highly suitable tapir habitat occurred in protected areas, 15{\%} in corridors and 58.3{\%} was outside the MBC-M and associated reserves. The spatial configuration of the MBC-M was partially concordant with the modelled set of conservation areas and corridors. The main dissimilarity was that the modelled corridors traversed forests in Belize and Guatemala to connect conservation areas. Analyses of deforestation since 1993 and human population density in the vicinity of the MBC-M indicated that future conservation efforts should give particular attention to the Montes Azules-El Triunfo Corridor due to greater habitat threat. The MBC-M has a great potential to play a prominent role in the conservation of tapir habitat but there is an urgent need to implement management plans that reinforce and complement this conservation initiative. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd, ISZS and IOZ/CAS.},

abstract = {The use of species distribution models (SDMs) to predict the spatial occurrence and abundance of species in relation to environmental predictors has been debated in terms of species' ecology and biogeography. The predictive power of these models is well recognized for vertebrates, but has not yet been tested for invertebrates. In this study, we aim to assess the use of SDMs for predicting local abundances of invertebrates at a macroscale level. A maximum entropy algorithm was used to build SDMs based on occurrence records of 61 species of butterflies and bioclimatic information with a 30 arc second resolution. Predictions of habitat suitability were correlated with butterfly abundance data derived from independently conducted field surveys in order to check for a relationship between the predictions of the model and local abundances. Even though the model accurately described the current distributions of the species in the study area at a macroscale, the observed occurrences of the species (i.e. presence/absence) recorded by the field surveys differed significantly from the model's predictions for the corresponding grid cells. Moreover, there was no correlation between observed abundance and the model's predictions for most species of butterflies. We conclude that the spatial abundance of butterflies cannot be predicted from environmental suitability modelled at a resolution as large as in this study. Using the finest scale bioclimatic information currently available (i.e. 30 arc seconds) it is not adequate to predict species abundances as structural and ecological factors as well as climatic patterns acting at a smaller scale are key determinants of the occurrence and abundance of invertebrates. Therefore, future studies have to account for the role of the resolution in environmental predictors when assessments of spatial abundances via SDMs will be conducted.},

The present study has as its objectives to study the distribution, standardization of suitable macropropagation methods for reinforcement and reintroduction in suitable wild habitat, as determined by ecological niche modelling (ENM) for the purposes of conservation. For improving the conservation status of the species, potential area and habitat for reintroduction was determined using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) distribution modelling algorithm. Seed germination under natural conditions was found to be very poor for which a macropropagation protocol was standardized; plantlets were raised and reinforced to locations where the population size is very small i.e., mean density, frequency of occurrence and abundance in relation to other associated species was 17.77, 14.16 and 0.82 respectively. Macropropagation method standardized here through cutting was found to be more efficient in terms of time and cost. Application of 100 ppm indole −3- butyric acid (IBA) and 40 ppm naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) significantly improved rooting traits. Further, survival rate was measured significantly very high at 73{\%} while 1000 numbers of V. borneensis plantlets were transferred to the field.

abstract = {Habitat suitability models can provide guidelines for species conservation by predicting where species of interest are likely to occur. Presence-only models are widely used but typically provide only relative indices of habitat suitability (HSIs), necessitating rigorous evaluation often using independently collected presence-absence data. We refined and evaluated presence-only habitat suitability models for nesting white-headed woodpeckers (Picoides albolarvatus), a narrowly distributed species of conservation concern that occupies dry conifer forests of the Inland Pacific Northwest, USA. We developed 2 models using Mahalanobis D2 and Maxent techniques from nest location datasets collected on the eastside of the Cascade Mountain Range, Oregon (1 dataset in 1997-2004 and another, sampling a broader spatial extent, in 2010-2011). Consistent with known ecology of white-headed woodpeckers, both HSI models related positively with percent ponderosa pine, moderate levels of canopy cover (approx. 40{\%}), and moderate-to-high levels of heterogeneity in forest structure. Unlike Mahalanobis HSIs, however, Maxent HSIs were consistently and positively related with nest prevalence and positively related with habitat use estimated with independent point count data. Locations with high Maxent HSIs were characterized by canopy openings adjacent to closed canopy forests. The fact that this habitat feature was described by Maxent HSIs but not by Mahalanobis HSIs possibly explains why Maxent HSIs better predicted white-headed woodpecker occurrence. Additionally, we used presence-absence data for model evaluation that sampled a broader spatial extent than nest surveys and therefore allowed us to demonstrate the generality of Maxent HSIs. Additional nest location data collected across a broader portion of the species range would be valuable for further model improvement and evaluation, but until such data are available, we recommend use of Maxent HSIs to guide habitat conservation and restoration efforts in unburned dry forests of Oregon.

abstract = {Modelling approaches have the potential to significantly contribute to the spatial management of the deep-sea ecosystem in a cost effective manner. However, we currently have little understanding of the accuracy of such models, developed using limited data, of varying resolution. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of predictive models constructed using non-simulated (real world) data of different resolution. Predicted distribution maps for three deep-sea habitats were constructed using MaxEnt modelling methods using high resolution multibeam bathymetric data and associated terrain derived variables as predictors. Model performance was evaluated using repeated 75/25 training/test data partitions using AUC and threshold-dependent assessment methods. The overall extent and distribution of each habitat, and the percentage contained within an existing MPA network were quantified and compared to results from low resolution GEBCO models. Predicted spatial extent for scleractinian coral reef and Syringammina fragilissima aggregations decreased with an increase in model resolution, whereas Pheronema carpenteri total suitable area increased. Distinct differences in predicted habitat distribution were observed for all three habitats. Estimates of habitat extent contained within the MPA network all increased when modelled at fine scale. High resolution models performed better than low resolution models according to threshold-dependent evaluation. We recommend the use of high resolution multibeam bathymetry data over low resolution bathymetry data for use in modelling approaches. We do not recommend the use of predictive models to produce absolute values of habitat extent, but likely areas of suitable habitat. Assessments of MPA network effectiveness based on calculations of percentage area protection (policy driven conservation targets) from low resolution models are likely to be fit for purpose. {\textcopyright} 2015 Ross et al.

abstract = {Climate envelope models (CEMs) have been used to predict the distribution of species under current, past, and future climatic conditions by inferring a species' environmental requirements from localities where it is currently known to occur. CEMs can be evaluated for their ability to predict current species distributions but it is unclear whether models that are successful in predicting current distributions are equally successful in predicting distributions under different climates (i.e. different regions or time periods). We evaluated the ability of CEMs to predict species distributions under different climates by comparing their predictions with those obtained with a mechanistic model (MM). In an MM the distribution of a species is modeled based on knowledge of a species' physiology. The potential distributions of 100 plant species were modeled with an MM for current conditions, a past climate reconstruction (21000 years before present) and a future climate projection (double preindustrial CO 2 conditions). Point localities extracted from the currently suitable area according to the MM were used to predict current, future, and past distributions with four CEMs covering a broad range of statistical approaches: Bioclim (percentile distributions), Domain (distance metric), GAM (general additive modeling), and Maxent (maximum entropy). Domain performed very poorly, strongly underestimating range sizes for past or future conditions. Maxent and GAM performed as well under current climates as under past and future climates. Bioclim slightly underestimated range sizes but the predicted ranges overlapped more with the ranges predicted with the MM than those predicted with GAM did. Ranges predicted with Maxent overlapped most with those produced with the MMs, but compared with the ranges predicted with GAM they were more variable and sometimes much too large. Our results suggest that some CEMs can indeed be used to predict species distributions under climate change, but individual modeling approaches should be validated for this purpose, and model choice could be made dependent on the purpose of a particular study. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Insects are the most diverse animal group, with remarkable and critical ecological roles, but the understanding of the taxonomic diversity, distribution, and biology of the overwhelming majority of lineages remains in its incipient stages. One means of addressing the lack of reliable distributional data for many groups is to predict probable records using species distribution models (SDMs), and this is particularly useful for generally undersampled and rarely encountered groups. Here, we use existing distribution records for species and genera of Mantophasmatodea (Insecta: Notoptera) to generate SDMs and discuss their utility for future sampling efforts. We used two different algorithms (Envelope Score and MaxEnt) to generate potential distributions and indicate areas for future field surveys for some of the genera and species of Mantophasmatodea with at least 10 unique occurrence records. The models showed good predictive capability (true skill statistics {\textgreater}0.9), with different taxa exhibiting variables, endemic ranges largely in southern and southwestern Africa, areas under considerable risk from climate change. South and Southwest Africa are the best places to focus sampling efforts for empirical data on current occurrences and any possible future shifts, as well as the potential for discovery of previously unknown species. These results also highlight the need to study the smaller and lesser known lineages of invertebrates that may not represent charismatic target taxa but nonetheless harbor unique life histories with unknown ecological roles. {\textcopyright} 2015, Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r Biologische Systematik.},

abstract = {Taxus globosa is a gymnosperm inhabiting Mexican and northern Central American temperate forests, and it has been considered as threatened by Mexican and international conservancy agencies. In Mexico, habitat loss is oneof the main threats for most of the cloud forest species including this taxon, being human-induced land use change a key issue. We obtained the potential distribution of this species through Maxent algorithm based on 73 herbarium records. Also the modification of vegetation cover for three time periods (1976, 1996 y 2000) was analyzed upon the potential distribution of this species. The known and potential geographical distribution was evaluated in relation to the current Mexican National System of Natural Protected Areas at federal level (ANPs) and Mexican Priority Regions for Conservation (RTPs), in order to determine the role of these areas in its conservation andmanagement. Potential distribution models show an important reduction (until 84 {\%}) of the distribution area related with land use change. This speciesis scarcely represented in the ANPs, because less than 10 {\%} of its potential distribution occurs within these areas of federal protection. This approach represents an important tool in biogeography and conservation, as well as in other areas of biology, due to its predictive ability. Our results highlight the urgency to preserve the remaining Mexican temperate forest patches, mainly cloud forest ones, to guarantee the existence of this species. {\textcopyright} Sociedad de Biolog{\'{i}}a de Chile.},

abstract = {Bats are an important component of biodiversity in Southeast Asia, and are key indicators of habitat quality. Acoustic analysis of echolocation calls not only allows the identification of bat species that are difficult to capture, but also allows for rapid and standardised ways to survey and monitor bats over large areas. However keys based on call parameters must also account for geographic variation in call parameters, and consider any effects of morphology and sex on call frequency. Presence-only modelling can predict likely geographic locations of specific taxa, and can used to refine decision making so that species unlikely to occur in a specific region can be omitted from more localised acoustic libraries. Here we develop an acoustic library for the echolocation calls of rhinolophoid bats in Thailand, and use presence-only modelling (Maxent) to explore how species with similar calls in a library developed at the national level can sometimes be largely allopatric, and hence identifiable, once geographic range is predicted. Presence-only modelling can also be used to explore whether species with similar calls adjust call frequency in likely areas of sympatry. We analysed calls from fourteen species of rhinolophid and twelve hipposiderid species from Thailand. Calls from a further three rhinolophid and one hipposiderid species are also described but not analysed statistically because of small sample sizes. Even without considering geographic variation, 69{\%} of rhinolophid (14 species with a minimum of five individuals/ species) and 91{\%} of hipposiderid calls (12 species) could be classified successfully to species using two call parameters (frequency of most energy (FMAXE) and duration) in a discriminant function analysis. Most of the discrimination was achieved because species often utilised different frequency bands. Morphology can also affect call frequency both across and within species. In both rhinolophids and hipposiderid families there was a negative relationship between FMAXE and forearm length. Within species, FMAXE was negatively related to forearm length in Rhinolophus microglobosus, R. pusillus and R. thomasi, and positively related to forearm length in R. affinis and R. pearsonii. Male R. pusillus called at higher frequencies than females, although there was no sexual size dimorphism in forearm length. Call frequency was negatively related to relative humidity in R. pusillus, suggesting that bats called at lower frequencies in humid environments to counter increases in atmospheric attenuation. Presence-only modelling was used to show that some species with similar call frequencies (e.g., R. lepidus and R. microglobosus; R. yunanensis and R. trifoliatus are predicted to occur largely in allopatry, and so could be identified reliably in particular parts of the country. Presenceonly modeling can assist in predicting areas of overlap between species with similar call frequencies. Other species (e.g., R. malayanus, R. coelophyllus) overlap in frequency when data from all of Thailand are combined, but seem to avoid call overlap when syntopic. Hence acoustic identification can be improved by taking into account local distribution patterns and patterns of species coexistence. The creation of call libraries at a local scale would have extensive potential as a resource to monitor changes in species distributions through time. {\textcopyright} Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.},

abstract = {Aim: As data accumulate, a multi-taxon biogeographical synthesis of the Mojave Desert is beginning to emerge. The initial synthesis, which we call the 'Mojave Assembly Model', was predominantly based on comparisons of phylogeographical patterns from vertebrate taxa. We tested the predictions of this model by examining the phylogeographical history of Hadrurus arizonensis, a large scorpion from the Mojave and Sonoran deserts. Location: Mojave and Sonoran deserts, United States and Mexico. Methods: We sequenced mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) data from 256 samples collected throughout the range of H. arizonensis. We analysed sequence data using a network analysis, spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA), and a Mantel test. We then used a molecular clock to place the genetic patterns in a temporal framework. We tested for signals of expansion using neutrality tests, mismatch distributions and Bayesian skyline plots. We used Maxent to develop current and late-glacial species distribution models from occurrence records and bioclimatic variables. Results: Phylogenetic and structure analyses split the maternal genealogy basally into a southern clade along the coast of Sonora and a northern clade that includes six lineages distributed in the Mojave Desert and northern Sonoran Desert. Molecular dating suggested that the main clades diverged between the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene, whereas subsequent divergences between lineages occurred in the middle and late Pleistocene. Species distribution models predicted that the distribution of suitable climate was reduced and fragmented during the Last Glacial Maximum. Main conclusions: Genetic analyses and species distribution modelling suggest that the genetic diversity within H. arizonensis was predominantly structured by Pleistocene climate cycles. These results are generally consistent with the predictions of Pleistocene refugia for arid-adapted taxa described in the Mojave Assembly Model, but suggest that a northern area of the Lower Colorado River Valley may have acted as an additional refugium during Pleistocene glacial cycles. {\textcopyright} 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The ectothermic nature of reptiles makes them especially sensitive to global warming. Although climate change and its implications are a frequent topic of detailed studies, most of these studies are carried out without making a distinction between populations. Here we present the first study of an Aspidoscelis species that evaluates the effects of global warming on its distribution using ecological niche modeling. The aims of our study were (1) to understand whether predicted warmer climatic conditions affect the geographic potential distribution of different climatic groups of Aspidoscelis costata costata and (2) to identify potential altitudinal changes of these groups under global warming. We used the maximum entropy species distribution model (MaxEnt) to project the potential distributions expected for the years 2020, 2050, and 2080 under a single simulated climatic scenario. Our analysis suggests that some climatic groups of Aspidoscelis costata costata will exhibit reductions and in others expansions in their distribution, with potential upward shifts toward higher elevation in response to climate warming. Different climatic groups were revealed in our analysis that subsequently showed heterogeneous responses to climatic change illustrating the complex nature of species geographic responses to environmental change and the importance of modeling climatic or geographic groups and/or populations instead of the entire species' range treated as a homogeneous entity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Zoological Society of Japan.},

abstract = {Determination of species geographic distribution and factors constraining it is a fundamental step for wildlife management and conservation. Red fox (Vulpes vulpes Linnaeus, 1758) is a widely cited species in carnivore ecological literature, mainly due to its wide distribution, generalist behavior and commonness. Nevertheless, few data are available on distribution constraints in the south-western part of its range. Our study aims to describe what factors are constraining the local distribution of this carnivore in central-west Portugal - a mountainous Mediterranean area, with a strong Atlantic climatic influence. A presence/pseudo-absence (based on the detection of signs of presence) Logistic Regression Model (LR) and a presence-only Maximum Entropy Model (Maxent) were constructed, testing the effect of several biotic (e.g., prey distribution) and abiotic variables (e.g., land cover, distance to urban areas, distance to roads, elevation) as constraining factors in the local distribution of the fox. The resulting models, based on 30 positive fox signs (plus 30 random pseudo-absence in LR) showed that only variables directly associated with food resources (presence of agricultural patches, closeness to human settlements/structures and proximity to areas with wild rabbit occurrence) significantly influenced the presence of foxes. These results were consistent for both modelling approaches. The high model fit of the LR model (AUC = 0.808), together with that of the Maxent analysis (AUC = 0.728), gave a high degree of confidence on these results. Our results demonstrate that although subject to some criticism., the indirect census method is easy to implement and can provide reliable results on populations' distribution and limiting factors. This approach might, and should, be complemented with other methods (e.g., captures, non-invasive methods, etc.) in order to obtain more precise information on population dynamics and ecology.},

abstract = {The objective of our study was to evaluate the hypothesis that the constraints on the expansion of the range of the common genet (Genetta genetta) in Europe are limitations derived from the species' patterns of habitat selection. From a sample of 2073 genet occurrence data and using species distribution models (SDM) built with Maxent, our results show that temperature-related variables were the main factor explaining the current distribution of the species. The maximum winter temperature was by far the most important environmental constraint of the presence of the species, with genets showing a preference for higher temperatures in the two coldest seasons of the year. Genets appeared also associated to Mediterranean zones, preferred mid-elevations and were more often present in habitats dominated by sclerophyllous vegetation. Our results stongly support the view that the influence of temperature is a major limiting factor that impedes the spread of the genet northwards and eastwards into continental Europe and limits its distribution. Nevertheless, the current spread of its colonization fronts could lead to future changes in its distribution, so it would seem that its expansion has not yet finished. {\textcopyright} 2016 Deutsche Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r S{\"{a}}ugetierkunde.},

abstract = {Aim: To synthesize the species distribution modelling (SDM) literature to inform which variables have been used in MaxEnt models for different taxa and to quantify how frequently they have been important for species' distributions. Location: Global. Methods: We conducted a quantitative synthesis analysing the contribution of over 400 distinct environmental variables to 2040 MaxEnt SDMs for nearly 1900 species representing over 300 families. Environmental variables were grouped into 24 related factors and results were analysed by examining the frequency with which variables were found to be most important, the mean contribution of each variable (at various taxonomic levels), and using TrueSkill™, a Bayesian skill rating system. Results: Precipitation, temperature, bathymetry, distance to water and habitat patch characteristics were the most important variables overall. Precipitation and temperature were analysed most frequently and one of these variables was often the most important predictor in the model (nearly 80{\%} of models, when tested). Notably, distance to water was the most important variable in the highest proportion of models in which it was tested (42{\%} of 225 models). For terrestrial species, precipitation, temperature and distance to water had the highest overall contributions, whereas for aquatic species, bathymetry, precipitation and temperature were most important. Main conclusions: Over all MaxEnt models published, the ability to discriminate occurrence from reference sites was high (average AUC = 0.92). Much of this discriminatory ability was due to temperature and precipitation variables. Further, variability (temperature) and extremes (minimum precipitation) were the most predictive. More generally, the most commonly tested variables were not always the most predictive, with, for instance, ‘distance to water' infrequently tested, but found to be very important when it was. Thus, the results from this study summarize the MaxEnt SDM literature, and can aid in variable selection by identifying underutilized, but potentially important variables, which could be incorporated in future modelling efforts. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Parkia biglobosa (locust bean) is an indigenous species which, traditionally contributes to the resilience of the agricultural production system in terms of food security, source of income, poverty reduction and agro-ecosystem stability. Therefore, it is important to improve knowledge on its density, current and future spatial distribution. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the tree density, the climate change effects on the spatial distribution of the species in the future for better conservation. The modeling of the current and future geographical distribution of the species was based on the principle of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) using a total of 286 occurrence points from field work and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility GBIF-Data Portal. Two climatic models (HadGEM2-ES and Csiro-mk3-6-0) were used under two scenarios RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 for the projection of the species distribution at the horizon 2050. Correlation analyses and Jackknife test helped to identify seven variables which are less correlated (r {\textless} 0.80) with highest contribution to the model. Soil, annual precipitation and temperature (diurnal average Deviation) are the variables which have mostly contributed to the models. Currently, 53{\%} of national territory of Benin, spread from north to south is very suitable for P. biglobosa. At the temporal horizon 2050, the scenarios have projected loss of habitats, which are currently very suitable for P. biglobosa. 51{\%} and 57{\%} are the highest proportions of this habitat lost, which has been registered with HadGEM2-ES model under two scenarios. In order to limit damages such as decreased in productivity and extirpation, some appropriate solutions must be found. It is important to plan the introduction of Parkia biglobosa in reforestation programs and the protection of its potential habitat at national level by the forestry administration which is an asset for a better conservation of this significant NTFP.},

Previous research has confirmed that the AHB may still expand its range farther north and that limiting environmental factors for AHB distribution vary across the country. This study examines similarities and differences in AHB distribution and the relative importance of environmental factors between two regions of the southwestern United States: southern Utah and southern California. The Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modeling approach was used to create two species distribution models of the AHB. First a model was created based on AHB presence data in Utah. This model was used to estimate the Utah distribution and also to project the California distribution based on Utah environmental preferences. The second model was created to predict distribution in California and to project distribution in Utah based on AHB environmental preferences in California. The level of influence of each variable was measured through percent contribution and permutation importance. Model performance was assessed through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Models estimated AHB presence with high accuracy (AUC {\textgreater} 0.95) in original environments, but were less accurate (AUC {\textless} 0.8) in novel environments. Minimum temperature was the primary controlling factor of AHB distribution in each model, and other variables followed similar ranking of importance between the two models. Species response curves varied substantially between the two models. Models did not transfer well from one region to the other because of local differences in response curves and the relative importance of environmental variables, suggesting that AHB in these regions may not have realized their potential geographic range. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The Ecuadorian capuchin (Cebus albifrons aequatorialis) is a critically endangered primate found only in the fragmented forests of western Ecuador and northern Peru, which are among the world's most severely threatened ecosystems. We use the MAXENT species distribution modeling method to model the potential distribution and environmental associations of Cebus albifrons aequatorialis, using all known presence localities recorded within the last 2 decades as well as 13 climate, topography, vegetation, and land-use data sets covering the entire geographic range of the subspecies. The environmental conditions that our model predicted to be ideal for supporting Cebus albifrons aequatorialis included ≥20{\%} tree cover, mild temperature seasonality, annual precipitation {\textless}2000 mm, and low human population density. Our model identified 5028 km2 of suitable habitat remaining, although many of these forest fragments are unprotected and are unlikely to support extant populations. Using the median population density across all sites for which data are available, we estimate the total carrying capacity of the remaining habitat to be 12,500 total individuals. The true number of remaining individuals is likely to be considerably lower due to anthropogenic factors. We highlight four critical regions of high predicted suitability in western Ecuador and northern Peru on which immediate conservation actions should focus, and we lay out clear priorities to guide conservation actions for ensuring the long-term survival of this gravely threatened and little known primate. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {We evaluated the accuracy of presence-only modelling for predicting the distribution of rare species, when data are scarce and usually collected with sampling biases. We modelled the potential distribution in Portugal of one of the rarest European bats Barbastella barbastellus and subsequently ground-validated predictions by using acoustic transects. We used ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) and maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling to build distribution models of B. barbastellus, and determined which ecological factors were more relevant for each model. As ENFA only accepts continuous variables, we built one Maxent model using the same variables as ENFA and another using land cover as a categorical variable. Ecological niche factor analysis and both Maxent models predicted similar areas of occurrence in central and northern regions of Portugal, although ENFA predicted suitable habitat over a wider range. Conversely, there was substantial disagreement on the location of high-suitability areas in the south. This could be a consequence of a different choice of important variables made by each model. Native woodland and average temperature were the most relevant variables for Maxent, while in ENFA B. barbastellus was linked to higher altitudes although avoiding production forests and infrastructures. Threshold-independent and -dependent statistics showed that Maxent models outperformed ENFA, probably as a consequence of divergent predictions in the new areas of occurrence. Overall, 15 new B. barbastellus sites were discovered and known distribution was extended c. 100 km to the south. Synthesis and applications. Our results support the use of presence-only modelling as an indispensible tool for survey design as shown by the discovery of B. barbastellus populations outside of the previously known range. ENFA seems to be more suited to determining a species' potential distribution, although failing to extrapolate it. In contrast, Maxent is better suited to determining a species' realized distribution. It was successful in predicting occurrence in previously unsurveyed areas and can be recommended as a technique for determination of a conservative distribution for a species. Maxent modelling would greatly aid biodiversity conservation, especially when it is necessary to develop survey plans or first assessments of a species' distribution. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Accurate modeling of geographic distributions of species is crucial to various applications in ecology and conservation. The best performing techniques often require some parameter tuning, which may be prohibitively time-consuming to do separately for each species, or unreliable for small or biased datasets. Additionally, even with the abundance of good quality data, users interested in the application of species models need not have the statistical knowledge required for detailed tuning. In such cases, it is desirable to use "default settings", tuned and validated on diverse datasets. Maxent is a recently introduced modeling technique, achieving high predictive accuracy and enjoying several additional attractive properties. The performance of Maxent is influenced by a moderate number of parameters. The first contribution of this paper is the empirical tuning of these parameters. Since many datasets lack information about species absence, we present a tuning method that uses presence-only data. We evaluate our method on independently collected high-quality presence-absence data. In addition to tuning, we introduce several concepts that improve the predictive accuracy and running time of Maxent. We introduce "hinge features" that model more complex relationships in the training data; we describe a new logistic output format that gives an estimate of probability of presence; finally we explore "background sampling" strategies that cope with sample selection bias and decrease model-building time. Our evaluation, based on a diverse dataset of 226 species from 6 regions, shows: 1) default settings tuned on presence-only data achieve performance which is almost as good as if they had been tuned on the evaluation data itself; 2) hinge features substantially improve model performance; 3) logistic output improves model calibration, so that large differences in output values correspond better to large differences in suitability; 4) "target-group" background sampling can give much better predictive performance than random background sampling; 5) random background sampling results in a dramatic decrease in running time, with no decrease in model performance. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Background: To implement the REDD+ mechanism (Reducing Emissions for Deforestation and Forest Degradation, countries need to prioritize areas to combat future deforestation CO2 emissions, identify the drivers of deforestation around which to develop mitigation actions, and quantify and value carbon for financial mechanisms. Each comes with its own methodological challenges, and existing approaches and tools to do so can be costly to implement or require considerable technical knowledge and skill. Here, we present an approach utilizing a machine learning technique known as Maximum Entropy Modeling (Maxent) to identify areas at high deforestation risk in the study area in Madre de Dios, Peru under a business-as-usual scenario in which historic deforestation rates continue. We link deforestation risk area to carbon density values to estimate future carbon emissions. We quantified area deforested and carbon emissions between 2000 and 2009 as the basis of the scenario. Results: We observed over 80,000 ha of forest cover lost from 2000-2009 (0.21{\%} annual loss), representing over 39 million Mg CO2. The rate increased rapidly following the enhancement of the Inter Oceanic Highway in 2005. Accessibility and distance to previous deforestation were strong predictors of deforestation risk, while land use designation was less important. The model performed consistently well (AUC {\textgreater} 0.9), significantly better than random when we compared predicted deforestation risk to observed. If past deforestation rates continue, we estimate that 132,865 ha of forest could be lost by the year 2020, representing over 55 million Mg CO2. Conclusions: Maxent provided a reliable method for identifying areas at high risk of deforestation and the major explanatory variables that could draw attention for mitigation action planning under REDD+. The tool is accessible, replicable and easy to use, all necessary for producing good risk estimates and adapt models after potential landscape change. We propose this approach for developing countries planning to meet requirements under REDD+. {\textcopyright} 2014 Aguilar-Amuchastegui et al.},

The proposed model involve a) obtaining data of 90 species (mammals, reptiles and amphibians) of which 30 are listed as protected; b) data cleaning and pre-processing of raster layers; c) processing with the species distribution model MaxEnt, d) averaging and generalization of threshold line, and e) post-edition and visualization. The results showed that the delimited area represents 10 times the size of the National Park and imply that species have a wider distribution than the current protected area. As a consequence, the current protected area is probably not large enough to safeguard the studied species. On the base of the newly delimited Buffer Zone, political agreements between park managers and municipal authorities are required to promote sustainable park management that foster protection of registered species.},

abstract = {Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is now the main vector-borne disease in Iran. Two forms of the disease exist in the country, transmitted by Phlebotomus papatasi and Phlebotomus sergenti s.l. Modeling distribution of the vector species is beneficial for preparedness and planning to interrupt the transmission cycle. Data on sand fly distribution during 1990-2013 were used to predict the niche suitability. MaxEnt algorithm model was used for prediction using bioclimatic and environmental variables (precipitation, temperature, altitude, slope, and aspect). Regularized training, area under the curve, and unregularized training gains were 0.916, 0.915, and 1.503, respectively, for Ph. papatasi. These values were calculated as 0.987, 0.923, and 1.588 for Ph. sergenti s.l. The jackknife test showed that the environmental variable with the highest gain when used in isolation has the mean temperature of the wettest quarter for both species, while slope decreases the gain the most when it is omitted from the model. Classification of probability of presence for two studied species was performed on five classes using equal intervals in ArcGIS. More than 60{\%} probability of presence was considered as areas with high potential of CL transmission. These areas include arid and semiarid climates, mainly located in central part of the country. Mean of altitude, annual precipitation, and temperature in these areas were calculated 990 and 1,235 m, 273 and 226 mm, and 17.5 and 16.4°C for Ph. papatasi and Ph. sergenti s.l., respectively. These findings can be used in the prediction of CL transmission potential, as well as for planning the disease control interventions. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2015.

The objective of this paper was to estimate the geographic distribution of 17 species considered of ornamental importance in M{\'{e}}xico. Presence data was compiled from specialized sources and public databases. Distribution maps were generated for each species with MaxEnt, using predictor variables related to temperature and precipitation. A spatial similarity and species diversity analysis was applied to group the species based on their geographic distribution. The distribution models were considered appropriate based on the Area Under the Curve, which ranged from 0.75 to 0.94 computed with independent data. Three geographic groups were identified; the first group had the largest coverage ({\%} of national area) and comprised the species Pyrisitia proterpia (59{\%}), Danaus gilippus (70{\%}) and Zerene cesonia (72{\%}). The second group ranged in coverage from 23{\%} (Archaeoprepona demophon) to 50{\%} (Anteos maerula), while the third group had the smallest coverage, ranging from 17{\%} to 40{\%}. Overall, the species diversity presents a latitudinal gradient, increasing from the north to the southern, Neotropical part of M{\'{e}}xico. States with the highest species potential are Veracruz, Tabasco, Colima, Michoac{\'{a}}n, Guerrero, Chiapas, Oaxaca, and most of the Yucatan peninsula. The application of these results to use butterflies to make souvenirs and as components of ecotourism is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2017 Korean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society},

The current potential distribution of Psa was modelled with two well-used models (CLIMEX and MaxEnt) based on available presence records and environmental data. Most discrepancies in model projections occurred for New Zealand data that was used for validation. Model projections can provide information to alert decision-makers in kiwifruit-growing regions to prepare for possible incursions of Psa. However, in this study because model indings did not agree on the New Zealand validation data, more research is necessary to achieve greater conidence on projections for novel areas. Despite that result, this study provides useful information for some kiwifruit growing countries that have not yet been affected by Psa, such as USA, Iran, Greece, Belgium, Denmark and especially South Africa, where commercial kiwifruit orchards have been planted recently. {\textcopyright} 2013 New Zealand Plant Protection Society.},

abstract = {Tapir distribution in Guatemala has dropped dramatically over the past century, causing populations to be restricted to protected areas of the northeastern region of the country. This study seeks to determine the conservation status of the species habitat in the country based on its presence, the importance of forest remnants in system connectivity and coverage of formal mechanisms of protection. The Maxent distribution modeling was performed using 62 records of presence 10 climatic variables and terrain elevation. The resulting map was reclassified into a binary map (cutoff 0.3) and using the Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis tool of GUIDOS program, a map in which the 12 larger forest remnants were selected was obtained. To these remnants the Integral Connectivity Index (dIIC) with Sensinode CONEFOR program was calculated. From the above, classifications of forest remnants were established to determine the conservation status of the species habitat. The potential distribution model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.815 and from the binary map it was estimated that the potential habitat of the tapir in 2012 was 26,095.82 km2. The Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis showed that the tapir habitat is mainly composed of core area (43 {\%}). The connectivity analysis indicated that the forest remnants of the Maya Biosphere Reserve (Northeast and West) and the Sierra de las Minas Biosphere Reserve have a dIIC of 33.505662, 0.51311405 and 0.38876015, respectively. The remnants of larger extension and higher dIIC correspond to the northeast and west section of the Maya Biosphere Reserve and Sierra de las Minas Biosphere Reserve. Compared with previous studies, there is a tendency in reducing coverage and degradation (fragmentation) tapir habitat, highlighting the vulnerability of the species populations in the country. {\textcopyright} 2016 Asociaci{\'{o}}n Mexicana de Mastozoolog{\'{i}}a.},

abstract = {The Brown bear (Ursus arctos Linnaeus, 1758) occupies contiguous areas in Eastern and Northern Europe. In Western Europe, the largest remnant populations occur in Cantabria, Spain and the Apennines, Italy. Under Italian law the bear and its occupied range are protected. The occupied range of the Apennine brown bear includes Majella National Park. However, information on the distribution within Majella NP is extrapolated and inconsistent, thus precluding evidence-based protected area and species management. To address this lack of information, bear presence records (1996-2010) were collated and corrected for observational bias. Multiple Species Distribution Models (SDMs) were created at 800. m resolution to predict year-round and seasonal bear distribution. A hierarchical, stepwise maxent SDM approach was applied using climatic, terrain, vegetation, and anthropogenic predictors of bear distribution. Occupied ranges were identified by point density analysis of bear presence. Our climate-only SDMs predicted bear presence in areas with relatively low snowfall and temperate temperatures. Year-round bear distribution was also accurately predicted by using temperate-montane elevations and mesic, mesotrophic vegetation substrates, irrespective of vegetation. Ski-resorts were negative predictors of year-round bear occurrence. Bears were predicted in autumn and winter by beech forest, in spring by meadows and in summer by a variety of vegetation categories. The regional and our local models predicted bear throughout the south. However, our predicted and occupied range in the north includes the Orta valley and exclude alpine heights, contrary to the regional models. Only our summer bear range is similar to a regional SDM. We demonstrated that multiple maxent SDMs using a modest number of observations and a comprehensive set of environmental variables may generate essential distributional information for protected area and species management where full wildlife and food source censuses are lacking. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Appropriate selection of environmental variables is critical to the performance of biodiversity models, but has received less attention than the choice of modelling method. Online aggregators of biological and environmental data, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and the Atlas of Living Australia, necessitate a rational approach to variable selection. We outline a set of general principles for systematically identifying, compiling, evaluating and selecting environmental variables for a biodiversity model. Our approach aims to maximise the information obtained from the analysis of biological records linked to a potentially large suite of spatial environmental variables. We demonstrate the utility of this structured framework through case studies with Australian vascular plants: regional modelling of a species distribution, continent-wide modelling of species compositional turnover and environmental classification. The approach is informed by three components of a biodiversity model: (1) an ecological framework or conceptual model, (2) a data model concerning availability, resolution and variable selection and (3) a method for analysing data. We expand the data model in structuring the problem of choosing environmental variables. The case studies demonstrate a structured approach for the: (1) cost-effective compilation of variables in the context of an explicit ecological framework for the study, attribute accuracy and resolution; (2) evaluation of non-linear relationships between variables using knowledge of their derivation, scatter plots and dissimilarity matrices; (3) selection and grouping of variables based on hypotheses of relative ecological importance and perceived predictor effectiveness; (4) systematic testing of variables as predictors through the process of model building and refinement and (5) model critique, inference and synthesis using direct gradient analysis to evaluate the shape of response curves in the context of ecological theory by presenting predictions in both geographic and environmental space. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied to predict the distribution of benthic species in the North Sea. An understanding of species distribution patterns is essential to gain insight into ecological processes in marine ecosystems and to guide ecosystem management strategies. Therefore, we compared 9 different SDM methods, including GLM, GBM, FDA, SVM, RF, MAXENT, BIOCLIM, GARP and MARS, by using 10 environmental variables to model the distribution of 20 marine benthic species. Most of the models showed good or very good performance in terms of predictive power and accuracy, with highest mean area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.845 and 0.840, obtained for the MAXENT and GBM models, respectively. The poorest performance was shown by the BIOCLIM model, which had a mean AUC of 0.708. Nevertheless, the mapped distribution patterns varied remarkably depending on the model used, with up to 32.5{\%} differences in predictions between models. For species with a narrow distribution range, the models showed a better performance based on the AUC than for species with a broad distribution range, which can most likely be attributed to the restricted spatial scale and the model evaluation procedure. Of the environmental variables, bottom water temperature and depth had the greatest effect on the distribution of 14 benthic species, based on MAXENT results. We examine the potential utility of this strategy for predicting future distribution of benthic species in response to climate change. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of a system of reserves may be compromised under climate change as species' habitat shifts to nonreserved areas, a problem that may be compounded when well-studied vertebrate species are used as conservation umbrellas for other taxa. The Northwest Forest Plan was among the first efforts to integrate conservation of wide-ranging focal species and localized endemics into regional conservation planning. We evaluated how effectively the plan's focal species, the Northern Spotted Owl, acts as an umbrella for localized species under current and projected future climates and how the regional system of reserves can be made more resilient to climate change. We used the program maxent to develop distribution models integrating climate data with vegetation variables for the owl and 130 localized species. We used the program zonation to identify a system of areas that efficiently captures habitat for both the owl and localized species and prioritizes refugial areas of climatic and topographic heterogeneity where current and future habitat for dispersal-limited species is in proximity. We projected future species' distributions based on an ensemble of contrasting climate models, and incorporating uncertainty between alternate climate projections into the prioritization process. Reserve solutions based on the owl overlap areas of high localized-species richness but poorly capture core areas of localized species' distribution. Congruence between priority areas across taxa increases when refugial areas are prioritized. Although core-area selection strategies can potentially increase the conservation value and resilience of regional reserve systems, they accentuate contrasts in priority areas between species and over time and should be combined with a broadened taxonomic scope and increased attention to potential effects of climate change. Our results suggest that systems of fixed reserves designed for resilience can increase the likelihood of retaining the biological diversity of forest ecosystems under climate change. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

To address this, we examined a representative clonal plant species, Duchesnea indica. We used microsatellite markers to analyze the genetic diversity of the species and used a correlation analysis to infer the relationship between climatic suitability and genetic diversity by using Maxent modeling. Then, we used a geographical information system approach to evaluate the change in genetic diversity of D. indica under climate change scenarios. There was a significantly negative relationship between climatic suitability and the genetic diversity of the clonal plant species. Using a proxy of genetic diversity, we found that climate change may alter the genetic diversity and even lead to a reduction in regional genetic diversity in D. indica. Annual precipitation, in particular, contributes to these changes in genetic diversity. Hence, climatic factors can be used as indicators of genetic diversity for clonal plant species, and studies should examine the impact of climate change on the maintenance of genetic diversity in plant species. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Availability and improved access to high-resolution digital terrain models (DTM) enables new approaches for the analysis of spatially explicit biological data. In this study, the spatial distribution of 16 tree species in a tropical mountain rain forest in South Ecuador and its relationship with topographic variables was evaluated at a fine-scale ecological level using two presence-only species distribution modelling techniques: The maximum entropy model (Maxent) and the ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA). Spatially explicit tree data stem from long-term forest monitoring plots in three microcatchments with a total area of 11.1 ha. Topographic variables were derived from a high-resolution DTM. Model performance was assessed by the true skill statistic (TSS) and area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC), using both a k-fold approach and null-models. Performance varied among species and techniques, but generally Maxent models showed better performance than ENFA models. Furthermore, the ecological plausibility of the models was confirmed by comparing them with a previously established forest type classification. Among the explanatory topographic variables, elevation and a Topographic Position Index (TPI) appear as the main determinants for the distribution of most of the tree species. This study demonstrates that even on a small scale, the use of presence-only species distribution modelling techniques is a viable option for modelling suitable habitat for tree species in tropical mountain rain forests, indicating suitability for supporting stand-level planning and site-species matching techniques for natural forest management. {\textcopyright} 2016, Erdkunde.

abstract = {Background: Disease risk maps are important tools that help ascertain the likelihood of exposure to specific infectious agents. Understanding how climate change may affect the suitability of habitats for ticks will improve the accuracy of risk maps of tick-borne pathogen transmission in humans and domestic animal populations. Lyme disease (LD) is the most prevalent arthropod borne disease in the US and Europe. The bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi causes LD and it is transmitted to humans and other mammalian hosts through the bite of infected Ixodes ticks. LD risk maps in the transboundary region between the U.S. and Mexico are lacking. Moreover, none of the published studies that evaluated the effect of climate change in the spatial and temporal distribution of I. scapularis have focused on this region. Methods. The area of study included Texas and a portion of northeast Mexico. This area is referred herein as the Texas-Mexico transboundary region. Tick samples were obtained from various vertebrate hosts in the region under study. Ticks identified as I. scapularis were processed to obtain DNA and to determine if they were infected with B. burgdorferi using PCR. A maximum entropy approach (MAXENT) was used to forecast the present and future (2050) distribution of B. burgdorferi-infected I. scapularis in the Texas-Mexico transboundary region by correlating geographic data with climatic variables. Results: Of the 1235 tick samples collected, 109 were identified as I. scapularis. Infection with B. burgdorferi was detected in 45{\%} of the I. scapularis ticks collected. The model presented here indicates a wide distribution for I. scapularis, with higher probability of occurrence along the Gulf of Mexico coast. Results of the modeling approach applied predict that habitat suitable for the distribution of I. scapularis in the Texas-Mexico transboundary region will remain relatively stable until 2050. Conclusions: The Texas-Mexico transboundary region appears to be part of a continuum in the pathogenic landscape of LD. Forecasting based on climate trends provides a tool to adapt strategies in the near future to mitigate the impact of LD related to its distribution and risk for transmission to human populations in the Mexico-US transboundary region. {\textcopyright} 2014 Feria-Arroyo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Researchers have proposed to compute a score (preferably between 0 and 1), called confidence measure (CM), to indicate reliability of any recognition decision made by ASR systems. There are many applications where confidence measures are used to make the right decision. Here we can decide whether the given word or phrase or sentence hypothesis corresponds to an actual occurrence of that event or not. Confidence measures will be used to specify a point of operation in the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC). So in this paper we will see the features of speech signal and how the algorithm of maximum entropy model, deep belief networks can be used to calibrate the confidence score. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Niche analysis methods developed within the biogeography community are routinely used for species distribution modeling of wildlife and endangered species. So far, such techniques have not been used to explain distribution of people in an area, nor to assess spatio-temporal dynamics of human populations. In this paper, the MaxEnt approach to species distribution modeling and publicly available gridded predictors were used to analyze the population dynamics in Southern Serbia (South Pomoravlje Region) for the period 1961-2027. Population values from the census administrative units were first downscaled to 200. m grid using a detailed map of populated places and dasymetric interpolation. In the second step, a point pattern representing the whole population (468,500 inhabitants in 2002) was simulated using the R package spatstat. MaxEnt was then used to derive habitat suitability index (HSI) as a function of gridded predictors: distance to roads, elevation, slope, topographic wetness index, enhanced vegetation index and land cover classes. HSI and environmental predictors were further used to explain spatial patterns in the population change index (PCI) through regression modeling. The results show that inhabiting preference for year 1961 is mainly a function of topography (TWI, elevation). The HSI for year 2027 shows that large portions of remote areas are becoming less preferred for inhabiting. The results of cross-validation in MaxEnt show that distribution of population is distinctly controlled by environmental factors (AUC. {\textgreater} 0.84). Population decrease is particularly significant in areas {\textgreater}25. km distant from the main road network. The results of regression analysis show that 40{\%} of variability in the PCI values can be explained with these environmental maps, distance to roads and urban areas being the main drivers of migration process. This approach allows precise mapping of demographic patterns that otherwise would not be visible from the census data alone. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Climatic changes raise the risk of re-emergence of arthropod-borne virus outbreaks globally. These viruses are transmitted by arthropod vectors, often mosquitoes. Due to increasing worldwide trade and tourism, these vector species are often accidentally introduced into many countries beyond their former distribution range. Aedes albopictus, a well-known disease vector, was detected for the first time in Germany in 2007, but seems to have failed establishment until today. However, the species is known to occur in other temperate regions and a risk for establishment in Germany remains, especially in the face of predicted climate change. Thus, the goal of the study was to estimate the potential distribution of Ae. albopictus in Germany. We used ecological niche modeling in order to estimate the potential habitat suitability for this species under current and projected future climatic conditions. According to our model, there are already two areas in western and southern Germany that appear suitable for Ae. albopictus under current climatic conditions. One of these areas lies in Baden-Wuerttemberg, the other in North-Rhine Westphalia in the Ruhr region. Furthermore, projections under future climatic conditions show an increase of the modeled habitat suitability throughout Germany. Ae. albopictus is supposed to be better acclimated to colder temperatures than other tropical vectors and thus, might become, triggered by climate change, a serious threat to public health in Germany. Our modeling results can help optimizing the design of monitoring programs currently in place in Germany. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Aim: Ecological niche modelling can provide valuable insight into species' environmental preferences and aid the identification of key habitats for populations of conservation concern. Here, we integrate biologging, satellite remote-sensing and ensemble ecological niche models (EENMs) to identify predictable foraging habitats for a globally important population of the grey-headed albatross (GHA) Thalassarche chrysostoma. Location: Bird Island, South Georgia; Southern Atlantic Ocean. Methods: GPS and geolocation-immersion loggers were used to track at-sea movements and activity patterns of GHA over two breeding seasons (n = 55; brood-guard). Immersion frequency (landings per 10-min interval) was used to define foraging events. EENM combining Generalized Additive Models (GAM), MaxEnt, Random Forest (RF) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) identified the biophysical conditions characterizing the locations of foraging events, using time-matched oceanographic predictors (Sea Surface Temperature, SST; chlorophyll a, chl-a; thermal front frequency, TFreq; depth). Model performance was assessed through iterative cross-validation and extrapolative performance through cross-validation among years. Results: Predictable foraging habitats identified by EENM spanned neritic ({\textless}500 m), shelf break and oceanic waters, coinciding with a set of persistent biophysical conditions characterized by particular thermal ranges (3–8 °C, 12–13 °C), elevated primary productivity (chl-a {\textgreater} 0.5 mg m−3) and frequent manifestation of mesoscale thermal fronts. Our results confirm previous indications that GHA exploit enhanced foraging opportunities associated with frontal systems and objectively identify the APFZ as a region of high foraging habitat suitability. Moreover, at the spatial and temporal scales investigated here, the performance of multi-model ensembles was superior to that of single-algorithm models, and cross-validation among years indicated reasonable extrapolative performance. Main conclusions: EENM techniques are useful for integrating the predictions of several single-algorithm models, reducing potential bias and increasing confidence in predictions. Our analysis highlights the value of EENM for use with movement data in identifying at-sea habitats of wide-ranging marine predators, with clear implications for conservation and management. {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Biodiversity conservation is a world challenge that needs attention and efficient strategies for its success. Modeling of geographic distributions of species is used in assorted applications related to biodiversity conservation. Maximum entropy (maxent) is a technique recently applied to modeling of geographic distributions of species and is being largely used by biologists. The aim is to evaluate different viewpoints of this technique. The first evaluation is concerned with the performance of the algorithm. A parallel version of the maxent-based algorithm available in openModeller is presented. openModeller is a set of tools provided for researchers interested in modeling of geographic distributions of species. The second evaluation is focused on tuning the regularization parameter, since it can severely affect the performance of the algorithm and can take a long time to be adjusted. In addition, the algorithm was evaluated without the use of a regularization parameter and with an adaptive maximum entropy approach. This approach was evaluated as a replacement of the regularization parameter. The validation of the assessments was based on a dataset with 20 species. The results show: an improvement in the algorithm performance using parallelism, considering only the running time; the regularization parameter does not depend on the number of samples, or on the number of iterations in training; species with the same number of samples fit better with different values of the regularization parameter (different magnitude order); the adaptive approach cannot replace the regularization parameter. {\textcopyright} 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Biological invasions and climate change pose two of the most important challenges facing global biodiversity. Of particular importance are aquatic invasive plants, which have caused extensive economic and environmental impacts by drastically altering native biodiversity and ecosystem services of freshwater wetlands. Here, we used the maximum entropy model, Maxent, to model the potential range expansion of three nonnative aquatic invasive plants: alligatorweed, limnophila, and giant salvinia, throughout the continental United States under current, 2030 to 2059 (2040), and 2070 to 2099 (2080) climate scenarios. Maxent is a popular method to model predicted current and future species distributions based on biogeography and climate. Alligatorweed, limnophila, and giant salvinia are noxious invaders of freshwater habitats in the southeastern United States and cause economic and ecological loss. In addition, we analyzed each species' habitat preference based on wetland type, occurrence in man-made habitats, and distance to the nearest stream to better understand what future habitats are at risk and how these species spread. Our results show that in 2040 and 2080 climate scenarios, all three species have the potential to increase their range throughout the northeastern United States and as far as New York and Massachusetts. The spatial distribution of alligatorweed was primarily determined by precipitation of the warmest quarter (15.8{\%}), limnophila was primarily determined by precipitation of the warmest quarter (52.2{\%}) and mean temperature of the coldest quarter (21.8{\%}), and giant salvinia was primarily determined by the mean temperature of the coldest quarter (24.3{\%}). All three species were found significantly more frequently in lakes and ponds than in other freshwater habits. Giant salvinia was found significantly more often in man-made wetland habitats. In order to reduce the detrimental impacts of these species, land managers in the northeastern United States should concentrate early detection and rapid response management in lakes, ponds and man-made wetland habitats. Nomenclature: Alligatorweed, Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb; giant salvinia, Salvinia molesta Mitchell; limnophila, Limnophila sessiliflora (Vahl) Blume. Management Implications: Aquatic invasive plant species are well known to have dramatic impacts on the habitats they invade. The impacts of these species include decreases in plant and animal biodiversity, altered nutrient cycling, and impact navigation and recreation of inland waterways. Climate change is expected to amplify the number of aquatic biological invasions by changing climatic conditions, particularly by warmer temperatures, increasing the likelihood that previously climatically restricted species will be successful in northern latitudes. Because of the serious consequences aquatic invasive plants pose to aquatic and wetland habitats, understanding the future range expansion of these species is imperative for early detection and management. Alligatorweed, limnophila, and giant salvinia are noxious invaders of freshwater habitats in the southeastern United States. In this study, we ask the following questions: What is the potential for range expansion of three highly invasive plant species in current and future climate scenarios? and What are the aquatic and wetland habitat preferences of these three species? Our results show that with future climate change, and consequently, warmer temperatures, these three species will have the potential to expand their ranges into the mid-Atlantic and northeastern United States. Lakes and ponds are at increased risk for future invasion because all three species were more frequently found in these habitats over other freshwater wetland types. Furthermore, giant salvinia was found significantly more often in man-made wetland habitats, which could increase its chance of flourishing in disturbed environments. The results of our study provide a first step in managing the future spread of alligatorweed, limnophila, and giant salvinia in the continental United States. In particular, land managers should concentrate early detection and rapid response management in lakes, ponds and man-made wetland habitats to effectively control the spread of these species and reduce overall costs of managing these species. {\textcopyright} 2015 Weed Science Society of America.},

abstract = {Aim Abundance of small passerines may be distributed over large wintering areas according to geographical patterns that are difficult to detect. This may prevent the identification and conservation of the most suitable sectors, or the detection of local and regional features affecting the species during winter. In this paper, we explore the usefulness of ring recoveries to predict bird distribution in wintering grounds by using Maxent, one of the presence-only techniques available for modelling species distributions. We test whether suitability indices obtained in 2.5×2.5km UTM squares from ring recoveries were positively correlated with the actual abundance of robins (Erithacus rubecula) and blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) inside the squares. Location Spain. Methods We used 686 and 1139 localities across the country in which blackcap and robin ring recoveries were recorded by the Spanish Office of Migratory Species to generate the suitability maps. In addition, we sampled bird abundance inside 70 control squares independent of ring recovery localities along a belt crossing mountains, highlands and lowlands of the Iberian Peninsula during January from 2006 to 2011. Results Suitability indices predicted by Maxent were positively correlated with robin (r=0.42, n=70, P{\textless}0.001) and blackcap (r=0.52, n=70, P{\textless}0.001) abundances in the 70 control squares along the belt crossing the Iberian Peninsula. Main conclusions These results suggest that the use of distribution models with ring recoveries may be used to describe the habitat suitability of the winter ranges of small, common passerines. This also means that the huge number of ring recoveries stored in national and transnational data banks could be used to explore the factors shaping bird ranges and to forecast the geographical distribution of suitable wintering areas of migratory birds in large, poorly known regions. This may be useful in biogeography and conservation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The geographical ranges of species are influenced by three components: spatial distribution of environmental conditions, biotic interactions and the dispersal capacity of species. The scarcity of distributional records in vast regions such as the Amazon impedes understanding of fish distribution. Predictive distribution models have emerged as a better alternative to surpass this problem, but the absence of large-scale maps for aquatic variables has been suggested as an important limitation. We aimed to evaluate the use of macroclimatic variables as surrogates for local limnological variables in the Brazilian Amazon. Ordinary least squares model were used to predict the local habitat variables from climatic and geomorphological information as macroscale variables. Models for six stream-dwelling fish were built in MaxEnt and validated using area under curve and true skill statistics (TSS). All local variables were predicted successfully (R2 {\textgreater} 0.39), and MaxEnt models had good suitability using the macroscale variables (TSS higher than 0.70). We conclude that macroscale variables can be effective surrogates for local habitat variables, at least for large-scale analyses on poorly sampled regions such as the Brazilian Amazon. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim: Information on change in species' environmental preferences (i.e., niche) is currently not included in IUCN Red List criteria, although such information is key for assessing whether species not only lose geographic range but also lose part of their realized niche. Here, using niche size quantification and niche-based species distribution models (SDMs), we test whether realized niche size and predicted potential range size provide additional information compared with the standard IUCN scores. Location: Switzerland, national scale. Methods: We simulated randomly, spatially directed, and ecologically directed local extinction events of varying magnitudes (10{\%}, 30{\%}, and 50{\%} of occurrences). For a set of 148 representative vascular plant species, we tested how accurately the geographic versus niche measures pictured these extinction scenarios respectively. Results: We found that changes in niche size often corresponded to changes in geographic space. However, there was considerable variation and, for many species, changes in geographic and in niche space delivered complementary information. IUCN criteria based on spatial projections of SDMs did not capture extinction events in most cases and often increased the modelled range size, even when up to 50{\%} of the occurrences were removed by simulated extinction events. Main conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that changes in niche size can provide valuable additional information and could be used more systematically to complement changes in range size for Red List assessments. In turn, change in SDM-predicted range size was not a good surrogate for classical extent of occurrence and area of occupancy criteria and should be used with caution. Further research is needed to assess whether and how spatial predictions of SDMs may be used to appropriately complement current IUCN criteria and to test whether our findings apply to other organisms and other spatial extents. {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

This study demonstrates the use of Maxent algorithm for modeling the potential geographic distribution of P. solenopsis in India with presence-only data. Predictions were made based on the analysis of the relationship between 111 occurrence records for P. solenopsis and the corresponding current and future climate data defined on the study area. The climate data from worldclim database for current (1950-2000) and future (SRES A2 emission scenario for 2050) conditions were used. DIVA-GIS, an open source software for conducting spatial analysis was used for mapping the predictions from Maxent. The algorithm provided reasonable estimates of the species range indicating better discrimination of suitable and unsuitable areas for its occurrence in India under both present and future climatic conditions. The fit for the model as measured by AUC was high, with value of 0.930 for the training data and 0.895 for the test data, indicating the high level of discriminatory power for the Maxent. A Jackknife test for variable importance indicated that mean temperature of coldest quarter with highest gain value was the most important environmental variable determining the potential geographic distribution of P. solenopsis. The approaches used for delineating the ecological niche and prediction of potential geographic distribution are described briefly. Possible applications and limitations of the present modeling approach in future research and as a decision making tool in integrated pest management are discussed. {\textcopyright} Triveni Enterprises.},

abstract = {Frame-building bryozoans occasionally occur in sufficient densities in New Zealand waters to generate habitat for other macrofauna. The environmental conditions necessary for bryozoans to generate such habitat, and the distributions of these species, are poorly known. Bryozoan-generated habitats are vulnerable to bottom fishing, so knowledge of species' distributions is essential for management purposes. To better understand these distributions, presence records were collated and mapped, and habitat suitability models were generated (Maxent, 1 km2 grid) for the 11 most common habitat-forming bryozoan species: Arachnopusia unicornis, Cellaria immersa, Cellaria tenuirostris, Celleporaria agglutinans, Celleporina grandis, Cinctipora elegans, Diaperoecia purpurascens, Galeopsis porcellanicus, Hippomenella vellicata, Hornera foliacea, and Smittoidea maunganuiensis. The models confirmed known areas of habitat, and indicated other areas as potentially suitable. Water depth, vertical water mixing, tidal currents, and water temperature were useful for describing the distribution of the bryozoan species at broad scales. Areas predicted as suitable for multiple species were identified, and these 'hotspots' were compared to fishing effort data. This showed a potential conflict between fishing and the conservation of bryozoan-generated habitat. Fishing impacts are known from some sites, but damage to large areas of habitat-forming bryozoans is likely to have occurred throughout the study area. In the present study, spatial error associated with the use of historic records and the coarse native resolution of the environmental variables limited both the resolution at which the models could be interpreted and our understanding of the ecological requirements of the study species. However, these models show species distribution modelling has potential to further our understanding of habitat-forming bryozoan ecology and distribution. Importantly, comparisons between hotspots of suitable habitat and the distribution of bottom fishing in the study area highlight the need for management measures designed to mitigate the impact of seafloor disturbance on bryozoan-generated habitat in New Zealand waters. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wood et al.},

abstract = {Globalization has led to an increased spread of alien invasive species, which can alter mutualistic relationships, community dynamics, ecosystem function, and resource distributions. They can cause extinctions thereby affecting local and global diversity. Among reptiles two gecko species, Hemidactylus frenatus and Hemidactylus mabouia, have considerably increased their range during the last century. Both have already caused local decimations and extinctions of native species. Records of invasive populations of H. frenatus are known from tropical Asia through Central America and Florida, whilst invasive populations of H. mabouia can be found in Central and Southern Africa, as well as in large parts of Central and South America. Only a few sympatric populations are known. Herein, we identify areas potentially suitable for the geckos using a climate envelope approach, we predict their potential distribution under current conditions and a future climate change scenario, and try to assess why sympatric populations of both geckos are apparently rare. Our results suggest that areas of suitable climatic conditions for both species can be found in nearly all tropical regions. Future projections revealed that the amount of climatically suitable areas will increase for H. frenatus on a global scale, but decrease for H. mabouia. The greatest changes are suggested for South America where further spreading of H. frenatus will be enhanced due to better climatic conditions. In contrast, climatic conditions for H. mabouia will degrade in this region. We conclude that both competitive exclusion and a non equilibrium in the ranges of the species explain the virtual absence of sympatric populations, although the impact of climate on competitive success is pending further testing in the field.},

Occurrences in Oklahoma were not predicted present based on the projection of the model using the previously known distribution of the species, except for the location of the Red Slough Wildlife Management Area in southeastern Oklahoma. However, including the new records in the model changes the predicted suitable habitat for the species in Oklahoma, encompassing all new locations and a large portion of eastern Oklahoma. We suggest that eastern Oklahoma and Texas represent the western edge of the range of C. ludovicianus. Further surveys in the field for C. ludovicianus at the limits of its range are required to understand detailed requirements of its habitat.},

abstract = {Endemic species play an important role in conservation ecology. However, knowledge of the real distribution and ecology is still scarce for many endemics. The aims of this study were to predict the distribution of the short-range endemic Alpine jumping bristletail Machilis pallida; to evaluate the actual level of endemism via ground validation using an iterative approach for testing the models in field trips and increasing the quality of the prediction step by step; and to test the potential of species distribution modelling for increasing the knowledge about the ecological niche. Based on seven known locations of M. pallida, we used species distribution modelling via Maxent. After a set of seven field trips a new model was built if new locations were found. Three such iterations were performed to increase model quality. We discovered four new locations of M. pallida, increasing the area of known distribution from 470 to 4,890 km 2. The distribution of M. pallida is thus wider than formerly known, but our results support Eastern Alpine endemism of the species. The knowledge about the ecological niche could be increased due to the newly found locations. Our study showcases the potential of the iterative approach of modelling and ground validation to evaluate the actual level of endemism and the ecological niche in Alpine species and beyond. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Knowledge of geographical distributions and habitat preferences are central to the conservation and management of threatened species. Ecological niche models can be used to map potentially suitable habitat, making them valuable tools in conservation biology. These models can assist in searching for new populations of species with poorly known distributions and can also be used to guide area selection for systematic biodiversity planning. These models have traditionally required ten or more occurrence records for calibration and this has limited the use of these tools in conservation biology, since many threatened species are known from fewer records. However, recently models have been successfully calibrated using few records. To illustrate this, we developed an ecological niche model to map the potential distribution of the endangered Juliana's golden mole (Neamblysomus julianae) in South Africa so that it could be used in searching for unrecorded populations and for area selection in systematic biodiversity plans. A model was calibrated in Maxent using only four occurrence records. Predictor variables included various bioclimatic, soil and vegetation types. The model identified limited suitable habitat within the map region. The first model facilitated the identification of two previously unrecorded populations. A second model was calibrated using the two additional occurrence records. This increased the proportion of correctly predicted presence records. Jackknife analyses indicated that the models were successful at predicting known presences as suitable. This paper demonstrates the use of ecological niche modelling to conservation of a cryptic endangered species with a poorly known distribution and discusses issues that are relevant for the application of this approach to other species. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Outdoor recreation, particularly in winter, causes pressure on wildlife. While many species seem to adjust well to predictable on-trail recreation activities, unpredictable off-trail activities are considered harmful. Measures to minimise human disturbance require the identification of 'conflict-sites' where human activities are likely to interfere with the requirements of wildlife. We used winter recreation data combined with spatial modelling to predict where recreationists move from marked trails into wildlife habitats in winter and to determine the environmental factors that trigger this off-trail behaviour. We surveyed marked winter trails in the southern Black Forest, Germany, by foot or ski for tracks of people leaving the trail, with three types of recreationists distinguished: hikers, snowshoe users and cross-country skiers. Using a maximum entropy approach, the probability of leaving the trail was modelled as a function of topographic, forest structure and tourism infrastructure variables. By combining the results with previously mapped habitat information of two disturbance sensitive species, the capercaillie Tetrao urogallus and the red deer Cervus elaphus, we identified conflict sites where mitigation measures would be most effective. All models were effective in predicting the locations where people left the trails and the three types of recreationists showed a similar pattern: the presence of closed summer trails and signposts along these trails proved to be the factors most strongly affecting the probability of leaving marked trails, followed by slope, which was negatively correlated with the probability of going off-trail. People leaving directly into the forest, not using a summer trail, were most positively influenced by the successional stages 'regeneration' and 'old forest', whereas increasing canopy cover decreased the probability of leaving the trail. The models were extrapolated to all marked trails in the study area. Locations with a high probability of people leaving the trails were identified and intersected with the previously mapped key habitats of the two wildlife species, thereby showing the locations where leaving the trail would be linked with a high potential of human-wildlife conflict. By indicating what triggers people to leave the trails, and identifying the critical locations, our results contribute to the determination of adequate management measures. {\textcopyright} Wildlife Biology, NKV.},

The main objective of this research has been to compare three different prediction species models, the so-called Maxent, logistic regression and multi criteria evaluation with fuzzy logic, in order to determine the model which best describes the ecological niche of the Anopheles spp species, which transmits malaria within Ecuador. After performing a detailed data collection and data processing, we applied the mentioned models and validated them with a statistical analysis in order to discover that the Maxent model has been the model that best defines the distribution of Anopheles spp within the territory.

abstract = {The ongoing biodiversity crisis is pushing ecologists and conservation biologists to develop models to foretell the effects of human-induced transformation of natural resources on the distribution of species, although ecology and biogeography still lacks a paradigmatic body of theory to fully understand the drivers of biodiversity patterns. Two decades of research on ecological niche models and species distributions have been characterized by technical development and discussions on a plethora of methods or algorithms to infer and predict species distributions. Here we suggest a metaphorical classification scheme for some of the most popular models based on their complexity, interpretability and suitability for specific applications in ecology and conservation biology. Our purpose is not to compare methods by their capacity to accurately predict the observed distribution of species, nor to criticize how they are commonly used in applied studies. Instead, we believe that a simple classification scheme can potentially highlight how some methods are more suited for specific applications in ecology and conservation biology. Envelope and distance-based models are grouped into the "fish bowl" category, for their transparency and simplicity. Statistical models are classified as "turbine" models, because of their hidden complexity and general applicability. Finally, machine-learning models are classified as "vault" models, for their high complexity and lack of interpretability of fit parameters. We conclude that the diversity of species distribution models used today is expected for a young research field, but the choice of modeling strategy depends on the purpose of the study. We provide some general guidelines for choosing models for studies of conservation planning and climate change mitigation and suggest models of intermediate complexity for conservation planning and forecast of climate change effects on biodiversity as they provide a good balance between interpretability, predictive power and robustness to model over-fit. {\textcopyright} 2012 ABECO.},

abstract = {Mire, known as the ecosystems would be the most vulnerable to climate change, is widely distributed in the Northeastern (NE) China, and the NE China is one of the regions that would be mostly affected by the changing climates since the climate changes would mostly affect the area in higher latitudes. Therefore, studies of the spatial distributions of suitable habitats for mire in this region under future climate is obviously more important to conservation, restoration and mitigation among ecosystems, species distributions and climate changes. Based on the mire distribution data from the 1:4000000 Mire Map and 26 environmental factors in the NE China, the potential distributions of mire were predicted under the projected climate scenarios of current (1961-1990) and three future time-slices (2011-2040, 2041-2070, 2071-2100) through Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model as well as ArcGIS spatial analysis modules. The accuracy of predictions were accessed by the area under the curve (AUC) values of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and validation results showed that the predictions with MaxEnt model had a higher precision (mean AUC=0.826±0.005), and were credible and acceptable. The results for mire distribution showed that mire had a wide potential distribution range in the NE China, especially it mainly distributed in Great and Small Khingan Mountains and Sanjiang Plain under the current climate (based on the climate data from 1961-1990 years). However, the potential distribution area of mire decreased rapidly in NE China with changing climates since the new climate pattern would create new suitable habitat and make the currently suitable habitats would turn into unsuitable habitat for mire distribution, furthermore, the losing habitat rate was most higher than creating new habitat rate in this region under the changing climate. By 2011-2040 years, the current potential distribution area of mire reduced by 90.70{\%}, the new suitable potential distribution area increased by 12.48{\%}, the total potential distribution area of mire decreased by 78.22{\%}. By 2041-2070 years, the current potential distribution area of mire reduced by 99.21{\%}, the new suitable potential distribution area increased by only 3.23{\%}, the total potential distribution area of mire decreased by 95.98{\%}. By 2071-2100 years, the current potential distribution area of mire reduced by 99.80{\%}, the new suitable potential distribution area increased by only 2.48{\%}, the total potential distribution area of mire decreased 97.32{\%}. As for spatial distribution, main distribution area of mire would shift from east part to west part at the longitude direction and shrink from the south and north part to central part of the region at latitude direction. By 2011- 2040 years, the main potential distribution area of mire would shift to the northern part of Great Khingan Mountains, Songnen Plain, and Sanjiang Plain. By 2041-2070 years, the main potential distribution area of mire shifted to Hulunbeir Plateau, Songnen Plain, and Sanjiang Plain. By 2071-2100 years, the main potential distribution area of mire shifted to Hulunbeir Plateau and Songnen Plain. These results would provide important basis for making scientific management of mire and developing the measure for restoration mire and mitigating future climatic change in NE China.},

Plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi) is a typical subterranean rodent endemic to Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), which are considered ecosystem engineers influencing the alpine ecosystem function. It is also regarded as a pest aggravating the degradation of overgrazed grassland and subject to regular control in QTP since 1950s. Climate change has been predicted in this region but little research exists exploring its impact on such subterranean rodent populations. Using plateau zokor as a model, through maximum entropy niche-based modeling (Maxent) and sustainable habitat models, we investigate zokor habitat dynamics driven by the future climate scenarios. Our models project that zokor suitable habitat will increase by 6.25{\%} in 2050 in QTP. The predication indicated more threats in terms of grassland degradation as zokor suitable habitat will increase in 2050. Distribution of zokors will shift much more in their southern range with lower elevation compare to northern range with higher elevation. The estimated distance of shift ranges from 1 km to 94 km from current distribution. Grassland management should take into account such predictions in order to design mitigation measures to prevent further grassland degradation in QTP under climate change scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2015 Su et al.

In this study, we aimed at projecting the availability of suitable habitat for an endangered amphibian species, the Fire-bellied toad Bombina bombina, in Brandenburg (north-eastern Germany). We modelled a potential habitat distribution map based on (1) a database with 10,581 presence records for Bombina from the years 1990 to 2009, (2) current estimates for ecogeographical variables (EGVs) and (3) the future projection of these EGVs according to the statistical regional model, respectively, the soil and water integrated model, applying the maximum entropy approach (Maxent). By comparing current and potential future distributions, we evaluated the projected change in distribution of suitable habitats and identified the environmental variables most associated with habitat suitability that turned out to be climatic variables related to the hydrological cycle. Under the applied scenario, our results indicate increasing habitat suitability in many areas and an extended range of suitable habitats. However, even if the environmental conditions in Brandenburg may change as predicted, it is questionable whether the Fire-bellied toad will truly benefit, as dispersal abilities of amphibian species are limited and strongly influenced by anthropogenic disturbances, that is, intensive agriculture, habitat destruction and fragmentation. Furthermore, agronomic pressure is likely to increase on productive areas with fertile soils and high water retention capacities, indeed those areas suitable for B. bombina. All these changes may affect temporary pond hydrology as well as the reproductive success and breeding phenology of toads. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Although the breeding ecology of Audouin's gull has been widely studied, its spatial distribution patterns have received little attention. We assessed the foraging movements of 36 GPS-tracked adult Audouin's gulls breeding at the Ebro Delta (NW Mediterranean), coinciding with the incubation period (May 2011). This also coincided with a trawling moratorium northwards from the colony. We modelled the distribution of the gulls by combining these tracking data with environmental variables (including fishing activities from Vessel Monitoring System, VMS), using Maxent. The modelling range included both marine and terrestrial areas. Models were produced separately for every 2h time interval across the day, and for 2 fishing activity scenarios (workdays vs. weekends), allowing to assess the spatio-temporal distribution patterns of the gulls and the degree of association with fisheries. During workdays, gull distribution at sea fully matched with fishing activities, both trawling (daylight) and purse-seining (nightime). Gulls tended to avoid the area under trawling moratorium, confirming the high influence of fisheries on the distribution patterns of this species. On weekends, gulls made lesser use of the sea and tended to increase the use of rice fields. Overall, Audouin's gull activity was more intense during dailight hours, although birds also showed nocturnal activity, on both workdays and weekends. Nocturnal patterns at sea were more disperse during the latter, probably because these gulls are able to capture small pelagic fish at night in natural conditions, but tend to congregate around purse-seiners (which would enhance their foraging efficiency) in workdays. These results provide important insight for the management of this species. This is of particular relevance under the current scenario of European fisheries policies, since new regulations are aimed at eliminating discards, and this would likely influence Audouin's gull populations. {\textcopyright} 2015 B{\'{e}}cares et al.},

abstract = {Determining potentially suitable habitat is critical for effective species conservation and management, but can be challenging in remote or sensitive areas. An approach that combines non-intrusive spatial data collection techniques and supporting field data can lead to a better understanding of landscape-scale species distributions. Here we present two habitat suitability models, at 1 and 10 m resolutions, for the endemic wēkiu bug Nysius wekiuicola, a poorly-understood resident scavenging arthropod species present on the summit of Maunakea in Hawai‘i. Our models reveal that the wēkiu bug, restricted almost entirely to portions of cinder cones above 3500 m elevation, has a high degree of habitat specificity and represents a classically rare species. Across the 55 km2 study area, 850 ha of potentially suitable habitat were identified at the 10 percentile training threshold, with the core area located at the true summit. Our results show that elevation and surficial mineralogy were the strongest predictors of suitable habitat, with lesser contributions from aspect and slope. Climatic variables also likely influence wēkiu bug distribution patterns, but were not included in our models due to the coarseness of available climate data and high correlation between variables. Relatively minor differences between the two models, in terms of identifying the locations and amount of suitable wēkiu bug habitat, and a higher measure of performance for the 10 m resolution model, suggest that coarser resolution input variables may characterize suitable habitat more efficiently than very fine 1 m resolution data. The suitability models generated as a result of this study will be directly incorporated into conservation management and restoration goals, and can easily be adapted for other arthropod species, leading to a more holistic understanding of metacommunity dynamics at the Maunakea summit. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {The mountain chain of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in southern Mexico is globally significant for its biodiversity and is one of the most important coffee production areas of Mexico. It provides water for several municipalities and its biosphere reserves are important tourist attractions. Much of the forest cover outside the core protected areas is in fact coffee grown under traditional forest shade. Unless this (agro)forest cover can be sustained, the biodiversity of the Sierra Madre and the environmental services it provides are at risk. We analyzed the threats to livelihoods and environment from climate change through crop suitability modeling based on downscaled climate scenarios for the period 2040 to 2069 (referred to as 2050s) and developed adaptation options through an expert workshop. Significant areas of forest and occasionally coffee are destroyed every year by wildfires, and this problem is bound to increase in a hotter and drier future climate. Widespread landslides and inundations, including on coffee farms, have recently been caused by hurricanes whose intensity is predicted to increase. A hotter climate with more irregular rainfall will be less favorable to the production of quality coffee and lower profitability may compel farmers to abandon shade coffee and expand other land uses of less biodiversity value, probably at the expense of forest. A comprehensive strategy to sustain the biodiversity, ecosystem services and livelihoods of the Sierra Madre in the face of climate change should include the promotion of biodiversity friendly coffee growing and processing practices including complex shade which can offer some hurricane protection and product diversification; payments for forest conservation and restoration from existing government programs complemented by private initiatives; diversification of income sources to mitigate risks associated with unstable environmental conditions and coffee markets; integrated fire management; development of markets that reward sustainable land use practices and forest conservation; crop insurance programs that are accessible to smallholders; and the strengthening of local capacity for adaptive resource management. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract = {This paper explores the influence of forest structural parameters on the abundance and distribution of potential habitats for the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos medius) in three different forest landscapes in Poland. We applied predictive habitat suitability models (MaxEnt) based on forest inventory data to identify key environmental variables that affect the occurrence of the species under varying habitat conditions and the spatial configuration of suitable habitats. All models had good discriminative ability as indicated by high AUC values ({\textgreater} 0.75). Our results show that the species exhibited a certain degree of flexibility in habitat use, utilizing other habitats than mature oak stands commonly associated with its occurrence. In areas where old oakdominated stands are rare, alder bogs and species-rich deciduous forests containing other rough-barked tree species are important habitats. Habitat suitability models show that, besides tree species and age, an uneven stand structure was a significant predictor of the occurrence of middle spotted woodpecker. The total area of suitable habitats in the studied forests varied from 9{\%} to 60{\%}. Predictive habitat models identified several concentrations of suitable habitats (clusters) with the average distances between them ranging from 3.2 to 5.0 km. Although these distances lie within the species' dispersal ability, the migration of individuals between these sites might be difficult due to the necessity of travelling long distances through unsuitable forest types. {\textcopyright} Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board 2014.},

In the context of a EU project on the endangered Austropotamobius pallipes complex, we modelled the environmental niche of the species in two large areas of Northern (Lombardy, 43 records) and Central Italy (Abruzzo, Province of Isernia, Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park; 69 records). Ecological niche models (ENMs) were built by using the maximum entropy approach as implemented in the MaxEnt software, which predicts the occurrence of a species using presence-only data. The environmental niche was modelled using six variables: altitude, slope, aspect, human disturbance, mean temperature of warmest quarter and distance from stream. Each study area was modelled independently. Both ENMs obtained high performance scores as measured by the AUC index (Northern Italy: 0.854; Central Italy: 0.817). Slope in Northern Italy and the mean temperature of warmest quarter in Central Italy achieved the greatest predictive power. Our results clearly show that the endangered white-clawed crayfish has a narrow range of habitat selection in the two study areas. Our findings may help researchers to select the best sites for future reintroductions in conservation projects. Copyright {\textcopyright}2013 International Association of Astacology.},

abstract = {Aim Investigate the relative abilities of different bioclimatic models and data sets to project species ranges in novel environments utilizing the natural experiment in biogeography provided by Australian Acacia species. Location Australia, South Africa. Methods We built bioclimatic models for Acacia cyclops and Acacia pycnantha using two discriminatory correlative models (MaxEnt and Boosted Regression Trees) and a mechanistic niche model (CLIMEX). We fitted models using two training data sets: native-range data only ('restricted') and all available global data excluding South Africa ('full'). We compared the ability of these techniques to project suitable climate for independent records of the species in South Africa. In addition, we assessed the global potential distributions of the species to projected climate change. Results All model projections assessed against their training data, the South African data and globally were statistically significant. In South Africa and globally, the additional information contained in the full data set generally improved model sensitivity, but at the expense of increased modelled prevalence, particularly in extrapolation areas for the correlative models. All models projected some climatically suitable areas in South Africa not currently occupied by the species. At the global scale, widespread and biologically unrealistic projections by the correlative models were explained by open-ended response curves, a problem which was not always addressed by broader background climate space or by the extra information in the full data set. In contrast, the global projections for CLIMEX were more conservative. Projections into 2070 indicated a polewards shift in climate suitability and a decrease in model interpolation area. Main conclusions Our results highlight the importance of carefully interpreting model projections in novel climates, particularly for correlative models. Much work is required to ensure bioclimatic models performed in a robust and ecologically plausible manner in novel climates. We explore reasons for variations between models and suggest methods and techniques for future improvements. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

However, with a multitude of methods available, advice is needed on the best methods for the task at hand. In this study, we predictively modelled the distribution and extent of three vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) at the assemblage level ('Lophelia pertusa reef frameworks'; 'Stylasterids and lobose sponges'; and 'Xenophyophore fields') on the eastern flank of Rockall Bank, using three modelling methods: MaxEnt; RandomForests classification with multiple assemblages (gRF); and RandomForests classification with the presence/absence of a single VME (saRF). Performance metrics indicated that MaxEnt performed the best, but all models were considered valid. All three methods broadly agreed with regard to broad patterns in distribution. However, predicted extent presented a variation of up to 35 {\%} between the different methods, and clear differences in predicted distribution were observed. We conclude that the choice of method is likely to influence the results of predicted maps, potentially impacting political decisions about deep-sea VME conservation.

abstract = {Tubastraea tagusensis, a coral native to the Galapagos Archipelago, has successfully established and invaded the Brazilian coast where it modifies native tropical rocky shore and coral reef communities. In order to understand the processes underlying the establishment of T. tagusensis, we tested whether Maxent, a tool for species distribution modeling, based on the native range of T. tagusensis correctly forecasted the invasion range of this species in Brazil. The Maxent algorithm was unable to predict the Brazilian coast as a suitable environment for the establishment of T. tagusensis. A comparison between these models and a principal component analysis (PCA) allowed us to examine the environmental dissimilarity between the two occupied regions (native and invaded) and to assess the species' occupied niche breadth. According to the PCA results, lower levels of chlorophyll-a and nitrate on the Atlantic coast segregate the Brazilian and Galapagos environments, implying that T. tagusensis may have expanded its realized niche during the invasion process. We tested the possible realized niche expansion in T. tagusensis by assuming that Tubastraea spp. have similar fundamental niches, which was supported by exploring the environmental space of T. coccinea, a tropical-cosmopolitan congener of T. tagusensis. We believe that the usage of Maxent should be treated with caution, especially when applied to biological invasion (or climate change) scenarios where the target species has a highly localized native (original) distribution, which may represent only a small portion of its fundamental niche, and therefore a violation of a SDM assumption. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.

The geographical distribution of the gummy bark disease in some world countries depend on high temperatures for viroid-symptom expression. So, correlation between climatic factors and gummy bark disease through GIS is studied. We designed a satellite map for the gummy bark disease distribution all over the world using the previous registered results. Superimposed maps of BIOCLIM annual Min -temperature, Max-Temperature and the points distribution, indicated that gummy bark disease naturally occurs in the low temperature zones range from 8-18°C at winter and from 27-38°C at summer season where the altitude ranged from -351 to 1320 m. A novel method called maximum entropy distribution modeling was used for predicting potential suitable habitat for gummy bark disease in Egypt using occurrence records. The Maxent model's internal jackknife test of variable importance showed that altitude and mean temperature of driest quarter are the most important predictors of citrus gummy bark disease-habitat distribution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Academic Journals Inc.},

It was listed as 'Endangered' under the Canadian Species at Risk Act (SARA) and by the State of New York, largely due to its rarity, fragmented distribution, and degraded habitat. Our objective was to use species distribution modeling to better understand the spatial extent of suitable habitat for the pugnose shiner in the upper St. Lawrence River and to guide protection of habitat for this endangered species. We performed our analyses with MaxEnt, a species distribution modeling method based on maximum entropy. The pugnose shiner is associated with shallow areas of lakes or slow-moving rivers with abundant submerged aquatic vegetation. Therefore, we created a model based on depth, water velocity, and aquatic vegetation. For water depth and velocity, we used results of a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model from the Upper St. Lawrence River generated and calibrated by Environment Canada. Aquatic vegetation was estimated from a simple algorithm based on water depth and velocity. To minimize the effect of sampling bias in the analysis (i.e., sampling occurred predominantly in shallow waters), we also used restricted depth ranges in model generation. Our model produced highly significant results when depth was not restricted, and significant results for analyses with restricted depth ranges. Our results suggest an abundance of potentially suitable habitat for the pugnose shiner in the Upper St. Lawrence River, which exceeded the minimum area for viable population estimates for this species. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {For some groups such as bryophytes, the IUCN distribution criteria are of critical importance to evaluate threat status, since other parameters cannot be determined readily. In this study, we propose the use of ecological niche modelling methods to estimate the extent of occurrence (EOO) of species. Herbarium (LISU) collection data are used to estimate the potential distribution of bryophytes based on three different methods: GARP, MAXENT and ENFA. The records of bibliographic references were projected against model predictions, and used for validation purposes using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method, as well as knowledge about ecological and geographic affinities. Four species (Antitrichia californica, Riccia sommieri, Cryphaea heteromalla and Racomitrium hespericum) were chosen as case studies; they were selected to represent taxa with contrasting ecological requirements, biogeographic importance and conservation value. The main difference between the two approaches (topological and ecological) for determining EOO is that the former only consider species distribution in space, whereas ecological methods may include both spatial distribution as well as environmental ranges. The methodological advance presented here explores the links between population distribution and environmental data, filling the gaps between distribution and administrative borders. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Taiwan is rich in forest physiognomy and has lots of valuable forest resources. However, they disappeared gradually owing to rampant illegal logging in recent years. The target species are Taiwan red cypress and Taiwan cypress. The study aimed to predict the hot zone of illegal logging (HZIL) through species distribution model (SDM) coupled with 3S technology. In order to simulate different situations of HZIL, four sampling designs (SD) were created, including random sampling (T1), equal sampling (T2), inclined sampling (T3) based on the preference of illegal loggers for trees near a road and on gentle slopes, and the three SDs plus NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) values above 0.5 respectively (T4, T5, and T6), which represents healthy and big trees. The SDMs were built based on predictor variables, including elevation, slope, aspect, cost distance, easting, northing, and change in NDVI, by using DOMAIN, maximum entropy (MAXENT) and support vector machine (SVM). Regardless of which algorithm being used, T3 was better than T1 and T2 owing to its inclined sampling. And T6 was the best; in contrast, T2 was the worst one among them. MAXENT was the best, followed by SVM, and DOMAIN was the last on T6. The greater the difference in NDVI between before and after logging, the more easily and accurately the HZIL can be estimated. However, several other factors such as windfall, forest fire, and landslide may still cause erroneous forecasting. Hence, a follow-up study will use high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery and create new variables and sampling designs to tackle different situations in illegal logging so that the HZIL can be estimated more accurately. This approach will help the government to reverse the situation from run-after to preemptive strike on illegal loggers via 3S technology and protect the valuable forest resource.},

abstract = {Background: There is increasing evidence that the geographic distribution of tick species is changing. Whilst correlative Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have been used to predict areas that are potentially suitable for ticks, models have often been assessed without due consideration for spatial patterns in the data that may inflate the influence of predictor variables on species distributions. This study used null models to rigorously evaluate the role of climate and the potential for climate change to affect future climate suitability for eight European tick species, including several important disease vectors. Methods: We undertook a comparative assessment of the performance of Maxent and Mahalanobis Distance SDMs based on observed data against those of null models based on null species distributions or null climate data. This enabled the identification of species whose distributions demonstrate a significant association with climate variables. Latest generation (AR5) climate projections were subsequently used to project future climate suitability under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Results: Seven out of eight tick species exhibited strong climatic signals within their observed distributions. Future projections intimate varying degrees of northward shift in climate suitability for these tick species, with the greatest shifts forecasted under the most extreme RCPs. Despite the high performance measure obtained for the observed model of Hyalomma lusitanicum, it did not perform significantly better than null models; this may result from the effects of non-climatic factors on its distribution. Conclusions: By comparing observed SDMs with null models, our results allow confidence that we have identified climate signals in tick distributions that are not simply a consequence of spatial patterns in the data. Observed climate-driven SDMs for seven out of eight species performed significantly better than null models, demonstrating the vulnerability of these tick species to the effects of climate change in the future. {\textcopyright} 2015 Williams et al.},

abstract = {The genetic variability and the potential distribution under past (Last Glacial Maximum; LGM (MIROC and CCSM simulations)) and present conditions were studied for the anguid Hyalosaurus koellikeri, using analyses of two mitochondrial (ND1 and ND2) and one nuclear (PRLR) gene and species distribution modelling (SDM) including 19 geographical coordinates, covering most of its distribution range. Unexpectedly, the genetic results show that H. koellikeri presents a very low level of variability both in the mitochondrial and nuclear genes studied. The present predicted distribution of H. koellikeri revealed a large potential distribution in both north and eastwards directions, with suitable areas predicted in places where the species has never been reported before, as for instance the Rif Mountains in Morocco, as well as into most parts of northern Algeria and Tunisia. The LGM distribution is even larger compared to the present, with a continuous predicted distribution from Morocco to Tunisia, and even into Libya under the MIROC simulation. The results of the genetic and SDM analyses suggest that the now isolated populations from Debdou and Tlemcen have probably been in contact during the LGM, but its absence from both present and past predicted suitable areas is still a mystery. Hyalosaurus koellikeri depends mainly on closed deciduous forests (typically Cedrus atlantica and Quercus sp.) and open deciduous shrubland with high amounts of annual rainfall. The results of this study and the absence of recent sightings of the species outside the core distribution might indicate a regression of the species. Hence, a reevaluation of the conservation status of the species seems warranted. {\textcopyright} 2011 Brill Academic Publishers.},

One factor that may severely alter the ecosystems involved is the introduction and spread of invasive plant species, but the potential distribution and spatial aggregation of suitable habitats for several invaders have not been quantified. The Maxent approach was used to model the potential establishment within the entire mountain range of 11 alien invasive plant species based on stratified sampling and herbaria records and six variables representing climatic extremes, topography, and anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Predictions of habitat suitability were projected to two future change scenarios depicting increasing rates of climate warming and anthropogenic disturbances in 2050 and 2100. Under current climate and disturbance patterns, the models predicted suitable habitats for invasive species establishment to be aggregated in the south-west, east and north-east of the Ukrainian Carpathians, along major rivers and roads at altitudes of up to c. 700 m. Eight per cent of the total area within protected areas was predicted to be potentially susceptible to invasion by at least one species, with 13{\%} of these susceptible habitats being suitable for all 11 species. Under the future change scenarios, suitable habitat ranges increased significantly in the entire study area and within regions of high conservation value. All species were projected to gain suitable habitats at higher altitudes along linear habitats and to potentially expand their ranges laterally from habitats predicted as suitable for current conditions along small rivers and roads. Under the scenario solely of increased average seasonal temperatures, suitable habitats for the establishment of at least one species within protected areas and a proposed ecological network increased by more than 15 percentage points by 2050 and by more than 30 percentage points by 2100 when compared with predictions for current conditions. Similar future patterns were discernible for the aggregation of suitable habitats for all 11 species. Incorporating increases in anthropogenic pressures into climatic-change projections led to a significantly greater projected expansion of suitable habitats for establishment as compared to scenarios considering only climatic changes. As the 11 species have already established viable populations within protected areas, further spread of at least one species is likely if conservation planning is not changed to include the management of invasive species in such areas. {\textcopyright} Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2012.},

abstract = {Land use change is a major driver of declines in wildlife populations. Where human economic or recreational interests and wildlife share landscapes this problem is exacerbated. Changes in UK black grouse Tetrao tetrix populations are thought to have been strongly influenced by upland land use change. In a long-studied population within Perthshire, lek persistence is positively correlated with lek size, and remaining leks clustered most strongly within the landscape when the population is lowest, suggesting that there may be a demographic and/or spatial context to the reaction of the population to habitat changes. Hierarchical cluster analysis of lek locations revealed that patterns of lek occupancy when the population was declining were different to those during the later recovery period. Response curves from lek-habitat models developed using MaxEnt for periods with a declining population, low population, and recovering population were consistent across years for most habitat measures. We found evidence linking lek persistence with habitat quality changes and more leks which appeared between 1994 and 2008 were in improving habitat than those which disappeared during the same period. Generalised additive models identified changes in woodland and starting lek size as being important indicators of lek survival between declining and low/recovery periods. There may also have been a role for local densities in explaining recovery since the population low point. Persistence of black grouse leks was influenced by habitat, but changes in this alone did not fully account for black grouse declines. Even when surrounded by good quality habitat, leks can be susceptible to extirpation due to isolation. {\textcopyright} 2015, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.},

abstract = {Dahl's Toad-headed Turtle (Mesoclemmys dahli) is an endemic and threatened species from Northern Colombia. It was originally described by Zangerl and Medem (1958) but information on its distribution, natural history, and ecology has been limited. Recent research and conservation efforts have contributed to the identification of new populations and a broader understanding of its natural history. There is, however, no quantitative assessment of the species' potential distribution in Colombia, or studies of the factors that make certain areas suitable for the species. This type of information is important for developing and continuing species-specific conservation strategies. We modeled the habitat distribution of M. dahli at three spatial scales. We first modeled the species geographic distribution at an ecoregional scale in Colombia using presence-only data (known localities) and a maximum entropy (Maxent) model. Second, we evaluated the factors that differentiate the first order streams where the species occurs vs. those where it is absent at the locality of Chimichagua, Cesar (9°17.717'N, 73°47.741'W), during the dry season (December to March). Finally, we evaluated the habitat variables associated with the presence of turtles at trap sites within the streams in Chimichagua. Our model predicts the presence of this species in seven departments in Northern Colombia, occupying an area of about 32,700 km2. This estimate of the range represents a potential range extension of approximately 9,000 km2 compared to the previously known distribution. The model, however, does not inform us about habitat quality or abundance of the species throughout this range. The tropical dry forest ecosystem, which was the most important variable explaining the species range, has been heavily transformed by human activities and is remarkable for its low level of formal protection. In Chimichagua, the species was associated with first order streams (1-10 m width), with slow flowing ({\textless} 0.22 m/sg) and dark water ({\textless} 32 cm clarity). In this same locality, within the streams where it occurs, the species was associated with portions of the stream that had considerable ({\textgreater} 82{\%}) canopy cover and pools deeper than 78cm. This highlights the importance of the riparian vegetation for the species. {\textcopyright} 2012. German Forero-Medina. All Rights Reserved.},

Bushmint is rapidly invading tropical ecosystems across the world, including India, and is major threat to native biodiversity, ecosystems and livelihoods. Knowledge about the likely areas under bushmint invasion has immense importance for taking rapid response and mitigation measures. In the present study, we model the potential invasion range of bushmint in India and investigate prediction capabilities of two popular species distribution models (SDM) viz., MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) and GARP (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production). We compiled spatial layers on 22 climatic and non-climatic (soil type and land use land cover) environmental variables at India level and selected least correlated 14 predictor variables. 530 locations of bushmint along with 14 predictor variables were used to predict bushmint distribution using MaxEnt and GARP. We demonstrate the relative contribution of predictor variables and species-environmental linkages in modeling bushmint distribution. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess each model's performance and robustness. GARP had a relatively lower area under curve (AUC) score (AUC: 0.75), suggesting its lower ability in discriminating the suitable/unsuitable sites. Relative to GARP, MaxEnt performed better with an AUC value of 0.86. Overall the outputs of MaxEnt and GARP matched in terms of geographic regions predicted as suitable/unsuitable for bushmint in India, however, predictions were closer in the spatial extent in Central India and Western Himalayan foothills compared to North-East India, Chottanagpur and Vidhayans and Deccan Plateau in India. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The present study aimed to understand how Anatolian ground squirrels, Spermophilus xanthoprymnus (Bennett, 1835), have responded to global climate changes through the Late Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles. Accordingly, ecological niche modelling was used, together with molecular phylogeography. Using species occurrence data compiled from field observations and relevant sources and the maximum entropy machine learning algorithm in MAXENT, an ecological niche model was developed to predict the potential geographical distribution of S. xanthoprymnus under reconstructed past (the Last Interglacial, approximately 130000-116000years ago and the Last Glacial Maximum, 21000years ago) and present (1950-2000) bioclimatic conditions. In addition, using cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA sequences deposited in GenBank and the Bayesian skyline plot in BEAST, demographic events (population fluctuations) were further assessed over the history of Anatolian ground squirrels. Combined ecological niche modelling and molecular phylogeography revealed that S. xanthoprymnus, itself also a temperate (mid-latitude) species, has responded to global climate changes through the Late Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles in a fashion converse to that of most temperate (mid-latitude) species: its range expanded rather than contracted during the glacial periods and contracted rather than expanded during the interglacial periods. In other words, Anatolian ground squirrels have been in refugia during the interglacial periods, suggesting that the classical paradigm of glacial range contraction and interglacial range expansion for temperate species may not be as general as previously assumed. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract = {Outdoor winter recreation exerts an increasing pressure upon mountain ecosystems, with unpredictable, free-ranging activities (e.g., ski mountaineering, snowboarding, and snowshoeing) representing a major source of stress for wildlife. Mitigating anthropogenic disturbance requires the spatially explicit prediction of the interference between the activities of humans and wildlife. We applied spatial modeling to localize conflict zones between wintering Black Grouse (Tetrao tetrix), a declining species of Alpine timberline ecosystems, and two free-ranging winter sports (off-piste skiing [including snow-boarding] and snowshoeing). Track data (snow-sports and birds' traces) obtained from aerial photographs taken over a 585-km transect running along the timberline, implemented within a maximum entropy model, were used to predict the occurrence of snow sports and Black Grouse as a function of landscape characteristics. By modeling Black Grouse presence in the theoretical absence of free-ranging activities and ski infrastructure, we first estimated the amount of habitat reduction caused by these two factors. The models were then extrapolated to the altitudinal range occupied by Black Grouse, while the spatial extent and intensity of potential conflict were assessed by calculating the probability of human-wildlife co-occurrence. The two snow-sports showed different distribution patterns. Skiers' occurrence was mainly determined by ski-lift presence and a smooth terrain, while snowshoers' occurrence was linked to hiking or skiing routes and moderate slopes. Wintering Black Grouse avoided ski lifts and areas frequented by free-ranging snow sports. According to the models, Black Grouse have faced a substantial reduction of suitable wintering habitat along the timberline transect: 12{\%} due to ski infrastructure and another 16{\%} when adding free-ranging activities. Extrapolating the models over the whole study area results in an overall habitat loss due to ski infrastructure of 10{\%}, while there was a .10{\%} probability of human-wildlife encounters on 67{\%} of the remaining area of suitable wintering habitat. Only 23{\%} of the wintering habitat was thus free of anthropogenic disturbance. By identifying zones of potential conflict, while rating its relative intensity, our model provides a powerful tool to delineate and prioritize areas where wildlife winter refuges and visitor steering measures should be implemented. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Climate change has the potential to alter the distributions of threatened plant species, and may therefore diminish the capacity of nature reserves to protect threatened plant species. Chinese nature reserves contain a rich diversity of plant species that are at risk of becoming more threatened by climate change. Hence, it is urgent to identify the extent to which future climate change may compromise the suitability of threatened plant species habitats within Chinese nature reserves. Here, we modelled the climate suitability of 82 threatened plant species within 168 nature reserves across climate change scenarios. We used Maxent modelling based on species occurrence localities and evaluated climate change impacts using the magnitude of change in climate suitability and the degree of overlap between current and future climatically suitable habitats. There was a significant relationship between overlap with current and future climate suitability of all threatened plant species habitats and the magnitude of changes in climate suitability. Our projections estimate that the climate suitability of more than 60 threatened plant species will decrease and that climate change threatens the habitat suitability of plant species in more than 130 nature reserves under the low, medium, and high greenhouse gas concentration scenarios by both 2050s and 2080s. Furthermore, future climate change may substantially threaten tree plant species through changes in annual mean temperature. These results indicate that climate change may threaten plant species that occur within Chinese nature reserves. Therefore, we suggest that climate change projections should be integrated into the conservation and management of threatened plant species within nature reserves. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wang et al.},

Based on known locations of 34 breeding pairs and the data on location of forest areas with high conservation value (referred to as Biologically Important Forests), we created a habitat prediction model for TTW using a Maxent algorithm. We found that this species most often selected breeding sites characterized by high contribution of old-growth stands with uneven vertical structure and considerable amount of very old trees of previous generations, as well as boreal spruce-dominated bogs and riverine forests. Such sites were preferred regardless of their actual protection status, which leads to the following conclusion: although existing forest reserves are very important to three-toed woodpecker, suitable habitats with similar characteristics can still be found outside protected areas and are also utilized by the species. However, such sites outside reserves are threatened by fragmentation due to timber extraction. Therefore it is recommended to protect these sites by either including them into existing reserves or putting them under special management schemes. The presented model can be applied in similar environmental conditions across lowland Europe, allowing for identification of representative habitat network for future conservation planning at landscape scale. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Aim: We aimed to assess the generality of existing models of late Quaternary biodiversity refugia in the Brazilian Atlantic forest by testing whether taxonomic identity and range descriptors influence the extent by which previously proposed models of forest (habitat) refugia successfully predict species' inferred refugial areas. Location: Brazilian rain forest. Methods: We compiled and filtered records of 14 animal species that belong to distantly related groups (spiders, harvestmen, scorpions, amphibians, birds, lizards and mammals) and show distinct distribution patterns within the Atlantic rain forest. Using MAXENT, we generated three distribution models for each species under different climatic scenarios (current, 6000 and 21,000 years ago). Species-specific historically stable areas (refugia) were identified through the intersection of the three models. We then measured the amount of 'inclusion' of species-specific refugia within published forest refugia, and quantified 'filling' of the biome refugia by species-specific refugia. The influence of taxonomic distance between species and range descriptors were analysed. Results: Current distribution models generated for the 14 species had high accuracy (AUC {\textgreater} 0.9). Inclusion and filling, two uncorrelated metrics, varied among species and were not influenced by taxonomic identity. Species range characteristics influenced forest model filling only, with higher values found in widely distributed species (i.e. occurring from Northeastern to Southeastern Brazil). Main conclusions: Species-specific and forest refugial areas are not necessarily the same. The power of forest refugial models to predict species-specific refugial area differs among species and may be influenced by range attributes. Species data suggests the existence of a large refugium in Southeast of Brazil, a result at odds with the currently available forest-wide models. The predictive power of forest refugial models is narrowed; we now better understand their applicability limits. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

However, it is not clear if those records correspond to an expansion process or to a lack of sampling. Thus, the species range was modelled in order to identify which is its potential distribution, which areas are available for expansion, and which variables drive the distribution. Ten MAXENT iterative models were produced at 1×1 km scale. The suitable areas in Salamanca occurred only in the south-east part of the province. This area corresponds mainly to the Alag{\'{o}}n river basin, together with a small part of the Tormes river basin. The presence area was 1040 km2, meanwhile the absence one corresponded to 11309 km2. The models indicated a strong relationship with temperature and precipitation factors. Predictive models cannot confirm or reject the expansion process of the species. Then, H. meridionalis could be in equilibrium (or nearly) with the environment and may not spread further, or in expansion, but the process is almost complete. If the species is not in expansion, new records recently obtained in Salamanca could be the consequence of previous lack of sampling.

abstract = {Internationally there is political momentum to establish networks of marine protected areas for the conservation of threatened species and habitats. Practical implementation of such networks requires an understanding of the distribution of these species and habitats. Predictive modelling provides a method by which continuous distribution maps can be produced from limited sample data. This method is particularly useful in the deep sea where a number of biological communities have been identified as vulnerable 'habitats', including Lophelia pertusa reefs. Recent modelling efforts have focused on predicting the distribution of this species. However the species is widely distributed where as reef habitat is not. This study uses Maxent predictive modelling to investigate whether the distribution of the species acts as a suitable proxy for the reef habitat. Models of both species and habitat distribution across Hatton Bank and George Bligh Bank are constructed using multibeam bathymetry, interpreted substrate and geomorphology layers, and derived layers of bathymetric position index (BPI), rugosity, slope and aspect. Species and reef presence records were obtained from video observations. For both models performance is fair to excellent assessed using AUC and additional threshold dependant metrics. 7.17{\%} of the study area is predicted as highly suitable for the species presence while only 0.56{\%} is suitable for reef presence, using the sensitivity-specificity sum maximisation approach to determine the appropriate threshold. Substrate is the most important variable in the both models followed by geomorphology in the RD model and fine scale BPI in the SD model. The difference in the distributions of reef and species suggest that mapping efforts should focus on the habitat rather than the species at fine (100. m) scales. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In addition to being used as a tool for ecological understanding, management and conservation of migratory waterfowl rely heavily on distribution models; yet these models have poor accuracy when compared to models of other bird groups. The goal of this study is to offer methods to enhance our ability to accurately model the spatial distributions of six migratory waterfowl species. This goal is accomplished by creating models based on species-specific annual cycles and introducing a depth to water table (DWT) data set. The DWT data set, a wetland proxy, is a simulated long-term measure of the point either at or below the surface where climate and geological/topographic water fluxes balance. For species occurrences, the USGS' banding bird data for six relatively common species was used. Distribution models are constructed using Random Forest and MaxEnt. Random Forest classification of habitat and non-habitat provided a measure of DWT variable importance, which indicated that DWT is as important, and often more important, to model accuracy as temperature, precipitation, elevation, and an alternative wetland measure. MaxEnt models that included DWT in addition to traditional predictor variables had a considerable increase in classification accuracy. Also, MaxEnt models created with DWT often had higher accuracy when compared with models created with an alternative measure of wetland habitat. By comparing maps of predicted probability of occurrence and response curves, it is possible to explore how different species respond to water table depth and how a species responds in different seasons. The results of this analysis also illustrate that, as expected, all waterfowl species are tightly affiliated with shallow water table habitat. However, this study illustrates that the intensity of affiliation is not constant between seasons for a species, nor is it consistent between species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Kreakie et al.},

abstract = {In order to successfully manage and conserve species and plant communities, it is important to have a good understanding of their ecology and distributions. The three liverwort species Anastrophyllum donnianum, Scapania ornithopodioides and Scapania nimbosa, are restricted to the mixed northern hepatic mat community found in the most oceanic parts of north-western Europe. These species are of conservation concern because they are globally rare with strict environmental requirements and a limited dispersal potential, which makes them vulnerable to disturbance and climate change. In this study we used species distribution modelling to (1) predict their potential distribution in Norway (2) to assess whether they are limited by dispersal or suitable climate, (3) identify which climatic factors are most important in determining their distribution and (4) suggest regions for further field based surveys. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models were developed for each species using target-group background data, and five environmental coverage layers. Our results indicate that all three species are limited by dispersal rather than the availability of suitable areas in Norway. In particular, A. donnianum seems to be limited from reaching uncolonised highly suitable areas in northern Norway due to a barrier unsuitable region with insufficient summer rain. S. ornithopodioides is absent from northern Norway despite the presence of highly suitable regions scattered along the coast. The models locate highly suitable areas where conservation measures should be focused when they overlap with known populations. Areas of interest for targeting searches for potentially undiscovered populations are indicated. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Question: Predictive models constitute an important tool in multiple ecological applications. In this paper, we examine and compare the performance of six state-of-the-art methods commonly used in ecological modelling: Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). Location: Northern Spain. Methods: We used presence/absence data of 15 plant species of an alpine rangeland in northern Spain and 14 topographical and geomorphological descriptors to build the models. We used leave-one-out cross validation on each model and computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and the resolution and calibration diagrams of the resulting probabilistic predictions. We also analysed the binary presence/absence deterministic predictions and computed the corresponding confusion matrices to calculate sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's kappa and the True Skill Statistic (TSS). Results: In general, CART and MAXENT showed poor performance and MLR was competitive with the more sophisticated ANN, MARS and SVM methods. The best predictive resolution was obtained, in most cases, by ANN followed by SVM and CART models; however, MLR and MARS were generally the best calibrated. The MAXENT predictions attained, in general, poor resolution and moderate to good calibration. Conclusion: Assessment of model calibration and resolution, in addition to ROC and confusion matrix-derived indices, is an important step for model choice depending on the final aim. Most of the target species were accurately predicted showing that the variables used are suitable descriptors at the scale of analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

abstract = {MaxEnt is a program for modelling species distributions from presence-only species records. This paper is written for ecologists and describes the MaxEnt model from a statistical perspective, making explicit links between the structure of the model, decisions required in producing a modelled distribution, and knowledge about the species and the data that might affect those decisions. To begin we discuss the characteristics of presence-only data, highlighting implications for modelling distributions. We particularly focus on the problems of sample bias and lack of information on species prevalence. The keystone of the paper is a new statistical explanation of MaxEnt which shows that the model minimizes the relative entropy between two probability densities (one estimated from the presence data and one, from the landscape) defined in covariate space. For many users, this viewpoint is likely to be a more accessible way to understand the model than previous ones that rely on machine learning concepts. We then step through a detailed explanation of MaxEnt describing key components (e.g. covariates and features, and definition of the landscape extent), the mechanics of model fitting (e.g. feature selection, constraints and regularization) and outputs. Using case studies for a Banksia species native to south-west Australia and a riverine fish, we fit models and interpret them, exploring why certain choices affect the result and what this means. The fish example illustrates use of the model with vector data for linear river segments rather than raster (gridded) data. Appropriate treatments for survey bias, unprojected data, locally restricted species, and predicting to environments outside the range of the training data are demonstrated, and new capabilities discussed. Online appendices include additional details of the model and the mathematical links between previous explanations and this one, example code and data, and further information on the case studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation assessment is quite important for the endangered risk assessing and conservation management for threatened animals. Note that even sympatric species may differ in habitat fragmentation, due to the various ecological niche requirements and dispersal capabilities. We therefore develop an integrated method for assessing the habitat fragmentation that combines habitat suitability with dispersal distance data to assess the patch isolation, within-patch fragmentation and identify the functional habitat fragmentation categories. Specifically, the ecological niche modeling enables us to identify the species-specific suitable areas through connecting the niche requirements and distribution, which indirectly includes the effects of habitat loss and degradation. The integrated fragmentation assessments enable the conservation planners to consider not only the population isolation level in large scale, but also the spatial connectivity within-patch and different fragmentation categories for landscape conservation that would otherwise appear cryptic under more typical habitat suitability or fragmentation assessing approaches. Furthermore, these assessments cal also be applied in the quantitatively endangered status ranking.We applied this method in two sympatric montane Galliform birds in China, Chinese Grouse (Bonasa sewerzowi) and Blood Pheasant (Ithaginis cruentus) for comparison and illustration purpose. Generally, the suitable areas of Chinese Grouse were predicted to be significantly smaller than that of Blood Pheasant. The habitat of Chinese Grouse was also more severely fragmented than the Blood Pheasant through both scales of patch isolation and within-patch fragmentation. We therefore suggest that the Chinese Grouse should be even more threatened than previously considered. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We used ENM-based predictions and climatic data for two Global Climate Models, considering two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP4.5/RCP8.5). We also evaluated the effects of habitat loss and the importance of the Mexican system of protected areas (PAs) on the projected models for a more detailed prediction of TDFs and to identify hot spots that require conservation actions. We identified four major distributional areas: the main one located along the Pacific Coast (from Sonora to Chiapas, including the Cape and Baj{\'{i}}o regions, and the Balsas river basin), and three isolated areas: the Yucat{\'{a}}n peninsula, central Veracruz, and southern Tamaulipas. When considering the effect of habitat loss, a significant reduction ({\~{}}61{\%}) of the TDFs predicted area occurred, whereas climate-change models suggested (in comparison with the present distribution model) an increase in area of 3.0-10.0{\%} and 3.0-9.0{\%} for 2050 and 2070, respectively. In future scenarios, TDFs will occupy areas above its current average elevational distribution that are outside of its present geographical range. Our findings show that TDFs may persist in Mexican territory until the middle of the XXI century; however, the challenges about long-term conservation are partially addressed (only 7{\%} unaffected within the Mexican network of PAs) with the current Mexican PAs network. Based on our ENM approach, we suggest that a combination of models of species inhabiting present TDFs and taking into account change scenarios represent an invaluable tool to create new PAs and ecological corridors, as a response to the increasing levels of habitat destruction and the effects of climate change on this ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Background and Aims Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae, approx. 120 species) are carnivorous pitcher plants with a centre of diversity comprising the Philippines, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi. Nepenthes pitchers use three main mechanisms for capturing prey: epicuticularwaxes inside the pitcher; awettable peristome (a collar-shaped structure around the opening); and viscoelastic fluid. Previous studies have provided evidence suggesting that the first mechanismmay be more suited to seasonal climates, whereas the latter two might be more suited to perhumid environments. In this study, this idea was tested using climate envelope modelling. MethodsAtotal of 94 species, comprising 1978 populations,were grouped by prey capture mechanism (large peristome, small peristome, waxy, waxless, viscoelastic, non-viscoelastic, 'wet' syndrome and 'dry' syndrome). Nineteen bioclimatic variables were used to model habitat suitability at approx. 1 km resolution for each group, using Maxent, a presence-only species distribution modelling program. Key Results Prey capture groups putatively associated with perhumid conditions (large peristome, waxless, viscoelastic and 'wet' syndrome) had more restricted areas of probable habitat suitability than those associated putatively with less humid conditions (small peristome, waxy, non-viscoelastic and'dry' syndrome). Overall, the viscoelastic group showed the most restricted area of modelled suitable habitat. Conclusions The current study is the first to demonstrate that the prey capture mechanism in a carnivorous plant is constrained by climate. Nepenthes species employing peristome-based and viscoelastic fluid-based capture are largely restricted to perhumid regions; in contrast, thewax-based mechanism allows successful capture in both perhumid andmore seasonal areas. Possible reasons for the maintenance of peristome-based and viscoelastic fluid-based capture mechanisms in Nepenthes are discussed in relation to the costs and benefits associated with a given prey capture strategy. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.},

abstract = {Riparian erosion is one of the major causes of sediment and contaminant load to streams, degradation of riparian wildlife habitats, and land loss hazards. Land and soil management practices are implemented as conservation and restoration measures to mitigate the environmental problems brought about by riparian erosion. This, however, requires the identification of vulnerable areas to soil erosion. Because of the complex interactions between the different mechanisms that govern soil erosion and the inherent uncertainties involved in quantifying these processes, assessing erosion vulnerability at the watershed scale is challenging. The main objective of this study was to develop a methodology to identify areas along the riparian zone that are susceptible to erosion. The methodology was developed by integrating the physically-based watershed model MIKE-SHE, to simulate water movement, and a habitat suitability model, MaxEnt, to quantify the probability of presences of elevation changes (i.e., erosion) across the watershed. The presences of elevation changes were estimated based on two LiDAR-based elevation datasets taken in 2009 and 2012. The changes in elevation were grouped into four categories: low (0.5 - 0.7 m), medium (0.7 - 1.0 m), high (1.0 - 1.7 m) and very high (1.7 - 5.9 m), considering each category as a studied "species". The categories' locations were then used as "species location" map in MaxEnt. The environmental features used as constraints to the presence of erosion were land cover, soil, stream power index, overland flow, lateral inflow, and discharge. The modeling framework was evaluated in the Fort Cobb Reservoir Experimental watershed in southcentral Oklahoma. Results showed that the most vulnerable areas for erosion were located at the upper riparian zones of the Cobb and Lake sub-watersheds. The main waterways of these sub-watersheds were also found to be prone to streambank erosion. Approximatively 80{\%} of the riparian zone (streambank included) has up to 30{\%} probability to experience erosion greater than 1.0 m. By being able to identify the most vulnerable areas for stream and riparian sediment mobilization, conservation and management practices can be focused on areas needing the most attention and resources. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The availability of detailed environmental data, together with inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species' range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Ecological niche modeling is central to many problems in population dynamics, conservation biology, biogeography, and evolutionary ecology. Recently, methodological advances have been achieved by adopting modeling principles from statistical and machine learning. One such principle that has not been explored is that voted ensembles of weakly tuned (underfit) models often exhibit similar bias and lower variance than individual well-tuned models. A further contribution of machine learning is the one class support vector machine. One class support vector machines may be more suited to ecological niche modeling than classification algorithms because the ''boundary estimation'' property of this class of models better represents the conception of the niche as the set of environments in which populations of a species persist. This paper brings together these approaches and applies them to a data set on the distribution twospined blackfish (Gadopsis bispinosus) in southeastern Australia with the aim of improving performance and enriching the repertoire of methods for ecological niche modeling. First, a study of low-bias bagging (LOBAG) applied to conventional two-class support vector machines, an approach to presence-background modeling, found this method to be comparable to another widely used method, MAXENT. Next, I introduce a variant of LOBAG for one class classification, LOBAG-OC, to be used for ecological niche modeling with presence-only data. This method performed better than other presence-only methods (DOMAIN and BIOCLIM) and nearly as well as LOBAG and MAXENT, despite the fact that the presenceonly problem is considerably more difficult than the corresponding presence-background problem. Results of these analyses suggest that LOBAG and LOBAG-OC may provide robust, high-performing solutions to the presence-background and presence-only modeling problems and point to ways in which ecological niche modeling may be simultaneously both improved and automated. {\textcopyright} 2014 Drake.},

abstract = {Background: Schistosomiasis is a snail-borne disease endemic in sub-Saharan Africa transmitted by freshwater snails. The distribution of schistosomiasis coincides with that of the intermediate hosts as determined by climatic and environmental factors. The aim of this paper was to model the spatial and seasonal distribution of suitable habitats for Bulinus globosus and Biomphalaria pfeifferi snail species (intermediate hosts for Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni, respectively) in the Ndumo area of uMkhanyakude district, South Africa. Methods: Maximum Entropy (Maxent) modelling technique was used to predict the distribution of suitable habitats for B. globosus and B. pfeifferi using presence-only datasets with ≥ 5 and ≤ 12 sampling points in different seasons. Precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), pH, slope and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were the background variables in the Maxent models. The models were validated using the area under the curve (AUC) and omission rate. Results: The predicted suitable habitats for intermediate snail hosts varied with seasons. The AUC for models in all seasons ranged from 0.71 to 1 and the prediction rates were between 0.8 and 0.9. Although B. globosus was found at more localities in the Ndumo area, there was also evidence of cohabiting with B. pfiefferi at some of the locations. NDWI had significant contribution to the models in all seasons. Conclusion: The Maxent model is robust in snail habitat suitability modelling even with small dataset of presence-only sampling sites. Application of the methods and design used in this study may be useful in developing a control and management programme for schistosomiasis in the Ndumo area. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Climate change will impact forest ecosystems, their biodiversity and the livelihoods they sustain. Several adaptation and mitigation strategies to counteract climate change impacts have been proposed for these ecosystems. However, effective implementation of such strategies requires a clear understanding of how climate change will influence the future distribution of forest ecosystems. This study uses maximum entropy modelling (MaxEnt) to predict environmentally suitable areas for cork oak (Quercus suber) woodlands, a socio-economically important forest ecosystem protected by the European Union Habitats Directive. Specifically, we use two climate change scenarios to predict changes in environmental suitability across the entire geographical range of the cork oak and in areas where stands were recently established. Up to 40 {\%} of current environmentally suitable areas for cork oak may be lost by 2070, mainly in northern Africa and southern Iberian Peninsula. Almost 90 {\%} of new cork oak stands are predicted to lose suitability by the end of the century, but future plantations can take advantage of increasing suitability in northern Iberian Peninsula and France. The predicted impacts cross-country borders, showing that a multinational strategy, will be required for cork oak woodland adaptation to climate change. Such a strategy must be regionally adjusted, featuring the protection of refugia sites in southern areas and stimulating sustainable forest management in areas that will keep long-term suitability. Afforestation efforts should also be promoted but must consider environmental suitability and land competition issues. {\textcopyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht},

abstract = {Ecological niche models are commonly used to identify regions at risk of species invasions. Relying on climate alone may limit a model's success when additional variables contribute to invasion. While a climate-based model may predict the future spread of an invasive plant, we hypothesized that a model that combined climate with human influences would most successfully explain its present distribution. We used the ecological niche model MaxEnt to test our hypothesis with Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), a common invasive horticultural plant in the United States. We first predicted the future range expansion of the species in the United States using a model that was trained on the climate conditions in its native range. We then tested the ability of a climate-based model, which was trained on climate conditions in the invaded range, to predict the current distribution in the United States. Finally, we tested whether including a measure of human influence would improve this model. Our results indicate that, despite L. japonica's 200-year invasion history, it is expected to spread beyond its current US range. Climate and human influence combined explain the current distribution. Modeling the spread of invasive horticultural plants using climate alone risks under-predicting areas with poor climates and high human influence. Therefore, planting invasive horticultural species should be discouraged as even suboptimal climates may result in further range expansion. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Aim: Every spring endangered Mexican long-nosed bats (Leptonycteris nivalis) migrate up to 1200 km from central Mexico to southern United States. Evidence suggests that L. nivalis follows the blooms of paniculate agave plants (genus Agave, subgenus Agave). Paniculate agave inflorescences are adapted to attract bats, and studies have indicated that Leptonycteris spp. played a key role in Agave speciation. We test the hypothesis of the Agave migratory corridor by (1) modelling the distribution of the relevant Agave species; and (2) testing whether bat records are significantly related to Agave species richness as predicted by our models. Location: Mexico and United States. Methods: We selected nine paniculate Agave species based on a set of criteria and modelled the current distribution of those species using maxent and the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production (GARP), and geographic information systems to analyse the spatial correspondence of Agave richness and presence of L. nivalis. Results: We combined the Agave presence maps that resulted from the models with higher performance to create a richness map. This map indicated up to five species overlapping. L. nivalis occurrence areas correspond with areas with two, three and four Agave species more often than random expectations at the 0.05 significance level. The opposite is observed for areas with 0 Agave species where L. nivalis correspond less often than random. Main conclusions: Presence–pseudo-absence and presence–background modelling tools allowed us to map potential Agave presence. These maps could guide conservation actions to ensure the maintenance of this pollination corridor. Areas with higher number of Agave species are distributed along mountain chains and may provide foraging resources for L. nivalis for longer period of time during its migration. We recommend implementing a long-term monitoring programme in those areas to document inflorescence timing in Agave species and the presence of L. nivalis. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

However, Ruaha's carnivore populations cause intense conflict with local people, mainly due to livestock depredation, and are exposed to alarming rates of retaliatory killing, especially on village land adjacent to RNP. Depredation risk is likely to be influenced by both habitat features and livestock husbandry, but the specific environmental risk factors, and relative importance of habitat and husbandry, have never been assessed in this landscape. Here, we assessed which ecogeographic variables (EGVs) were associated with depredation risk for grazing livestock on village land, and generated a predictive map of large carnivore predation risk, based on species distribution modelling algorithms (SDMs). Secondly, we investigated the relative influence of husbandry and EGVs on depredation risk of enclosed stock, based on a generalized linear model. Grazing livestock predation risk was higher closer to rivers, and in areas of lower elevation and low percentage of tree cover, with 41{\%} of the area mapped as high-risk. For enclosed stock, predation risk was mostly influenced by low percentage of tree cover and increased rainfall, with no discernible influence of current husbandry, which suggests that traditional husbandry was insufficient to outweigh the innate predation risks associated with high-risk landscape areas. Adopting new husbandry methods, such as specialised guarding dogs and fortified livestock enclosures, could be valuable for reducing depredation and carnivore killing in the Ruaha landscape. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim: The distribution of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the deep sea is poorly understood. This has led to the emergence of modelling methods to predict the occurrence of suitable habitat for conservation planning in data-sparse areas. Recent global analyses for cold-water corals predict a high probability of occurrence along the slopes of continental margins, offshore banks and seamounts in the north-eastern Atlantic, but tend to overestimate the extent of the habitat and do not provide the detail needed for finer-scale assessments and protected area planning. Using Lophelia pertusa reefs as an example, this study integrates multibeam bathymetry with a wide range of environmental data to produce a regional high-resolution habitat suitability map relevant for marine spatial planning. Location: Irish continental margin (extended continental shelf claim). Methods: Maximum entropy modelling was used to predict L. pertusa reef distribution at a spatial resolution of 0.002°. Coral occurrences were assembled from public databases, publications and video footage, and filtered for quality. Environmental predictor variables were produced by re-sampling of global oceanographic data sets and a regional ocean circulation model. Multi-scale terrain parameters were computed from multibeam bathymetry. Results: Suitable habitat was predicted on mound features and in canyon areas along a narrow band following the slopes of the Irish continental margin, the Rockall Bank and the Porcupine Bank. Standard deviation of the seabed slope (54{\%}), temperature (28{\%}) and bottom shear stress (9{\%}) were the most important variables to predict coral distribution. Main conclusions: This is the first regional coral habitat suitability modelling study to incorporate full coverage multibeam bathymetry in the deep sea. The use of high-resolution environmental data and quality-controlled distribution data significantly reduces habitat overestimation demonstrated by global-scale analyses and produces detailed maps to support marine protected area network design. The strong response of the corals to local-scale terrain variability highlights the need to protect the seabed from anthropogenic impacts that may reduce its complexity, such as bottom trawling. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

This study quantifies the epistemic uncertainty in the species distribution modeling, which is generated by spatio-temporal gaps between the biogeographical data, model selection and model complexity. Epistemic uncertainty is generally given by the sum of subjective and objective uncertainty. The subjective uncertainty generated by the modeler-choice in the manipulation of the environmental variables was analyzed. The Snowy Plover in Florida (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus, SP), a residential shorebird whose geographic range is extended along the Panhandle-Big Bend-Peninsula Gulf coast was considered as case-study. The first fundamental step for studying the species distribution and how it will be affected by climate change is to obtain an accurate description of the shorebird coastal habitat. The land-cover was translated into ecosystem classes using a land-cover model that predicts the evolution of coastal ecosystems affected by sea-level rise scenarios. The best land-cover map decreased the objective uncertainty (intrinsically present in data or models) in representing the spatial structure of the coastal ecosystem, reduced the temporal gaps with the occurrence data, and diminished the subjective uncertainty due to the conversion from land-cover to model-classes. Multimodeling was performed to reduce the uncertainty in the prediction of the species distribution related to model uncertainty. The best representation of the species distribution was performed by MaxEnt. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the omission/commission test, the similarity index of the response curves, and the jackknife test were used simultaneously as indicators of the predictability of each species distribution model. The availability of updated high-resolution biogeoclimatological data was proven to be necessary in order to properly predict the species ranges for conservation purposes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Leishmaniasis is endemic in southern France, but the influences of environmental and climatic factors on its maintenance and emergence remain poorly understood. From a retrospective database, including all the studies reporting prevalence or incidence of CanL in France between 1965 and 2007, we performed a spatial analysis in order to i) map the reported cases in France, and ii) produce an environment-based map of the areas at risk for CanL. We performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by a Hierarchical Ascendant Classification (HAC) to assess if the locations of CanL could be grouped according to environmental variables related to climate, forest cover, and human and dog densities. For each group, the potential distribution of CanL in France was mapped using a species niche modelling approach (Maxent model). Results. Results revealed the existence of two spatial groups of CanL cases. The first group is located in the C{\'{e}}vennes region (southern Massif Central), at altitudes of 200-1000 m above sea level, characterized by relatively low winter temperatures (1.9°C average), 1042 mm average annual rainfall and much forest cover. The second group is located on the Mediterranean coastal plain, characterized by higher temperatures, lower rainfall and less forest cover. These two groups may correspond to the environments favoured by the two sandfly vectors in France, Phlebotomus ariasi and Phlebotomus perniciosus respectively. Our niche modelling of these two eco-epidemiological patterns was based on environmental variables and led to the first risk map for CanL in France. Conclusion. Results show how an ecological approach can help to improve our understanding of the spatial distribution of CanL in France. {\textcopyright} 2010 Chamaill{\'{e}} et al.},

However, previous studies of C3 and C4 grass biogeography have often inadvertently compared species in different and relatively unrelated lineages, which are associated with different environmental settings and distinct adaptive traits. Such confounded comparisons of C3 and C4 grasses may bias our understanding of ecological sorting imposed strictly by photosynthetic pathway. Here, we used MaxEnt species distribution modeling in combination with satellite data to understand the functional diversity of C3 and C4 grasses by comparing both large clades and closely related sister taxa. Similar to previous work, we found that C4 grasses showed a preference for regions with higher temperatures and lower precipitation compared with grasses using the C3 pathway. However, air temperature differences were smaller (2 °C vs. 4 °C) and precipitation and {\%} tree cover differences were larger (1783 mm vs. 755 mm, 21.3{\%} vs. 7.7{\%}, respectively) when comparing C3 and C4 grasses within the same clade vs. comparing all C4 and all C3 grasses (i.e., ignoring phylogenetic structure). These results were due to important differences in the environmental preferences of C3 BEP and PACMAD clades (the two main grass clades). Winter precipitation was found to be more important for understanding the distribution and environmental niche of C3 PACMADs in comparison with both C3 BEPs and C4 taxa, for which temperature was much more important. Results comparing closely related C3-C4 sister taxa supported the patterns derived from our modeling of the larger clade groupings. Our findings, which are novel in comparing the distribution and niches of clades, demonstrate that the evolutionary history of taxa is important for understanding the functional diversity of C3 and C4 grasses, and should have implications for how grasslands will respond to global change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Species distribution models are often used to characterize a species' native range climate, so as to identify sites elsewhere in the world that may be climatically similar and therefore at risk of invasion by the species. This endeavor provoked intense public controversy over recent attempts to model areas at risk of invasion by the Indian Python (Python molurus). We evaluated a number of MaxEnt models on this species to assess MaxEnt's utility for vertebrate climate matching. Methodology/Principal Findings: Overall, we found MaxEnt models to be very sensitive to modeling choices and selection of input localities and background regions. As used, MaxEnt invoked minimal protections against data dredging, multi-collinearity of explanatory axes, and overfitting. As used, MaxEnt endeavored to identify a single ideal climate, whereas different climatic considerations may determine range boundaries in different parts of the native range. MaxEnt was extremely sensitive to both the choice of background locations for the python, and to selection of presence points: inclusion of just four erroneous localities was responsible for Pyron et al.'s conclusion that no additional portions of the U.S. mainland were at risk of python invasion. When used with default settings, MaxEnt overfit the realized climate space, identifying models with about 60 parameters, about five times the number of parameters justifiable when optimized on the basis of Akaike's Information Criterion. Conclusions/Significance: When used with default settings, MaxEnt may not be an appropriate vehicle for identifying all sites at risk of colonization. Model instability and dearth of protections against overfitting, multi-collinearity, and data dredging may combine with a failure to distinguish fundamental from realized climate envelopes to produce models of limited utility. A priori identification of biologically realistic model structure, combined with computational protections against these statistical problems, may produce more robust models of invasion risk.},

Ecological niche modeling (ENM) offers a means to address this issue, but to date most studies using ENM have focused on terrestrial taxa. In general, ENM relates environmental information to species' occurrence data to estimate the ecological niche of a species, rather than just interpolating a geographic distribution. This process leads to predictions of suitable habitat that generally exceed the range actually inhabited by a single species: such areas of geographic over-prediction (commission) may be inhabited by closely related species, and the model thus offers the inferential power to predict the potential distributions of these species as well. We explored the utility of ENM to investigate potential distributions of chirodropid box-jellyfishes (Cnidaria: Cubozoa), a group of highly toxic invertebrates whose biogeography is poorly understood. We were able to predict reported occurrences of box-jellyfishes throughout the Indo-Pacific from data of closely related species. By doing so, we demonstrate that geographic over-prediction in ENM can be desirable when concerned with predictions beyond current knowledge of species' distributions. Several methods are used for ENM; here, we compared the 2 most commonly used methods, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Predictions (GARP) and a maximum entropy approach (Maxent). Our comparison shows that Maxent may be more prone to overfitting, whereas GARP tends to produce broader predictions. Transforming continuous Maxent predictions into binary predictions remedies problems of overfitting, and allows for effective extrapolation into unsampled geographic space.},

abstract = {Populations of migratory birds can be affected by events happening at both breeding and wintering grounds. The Sahel is a vast region holding a large number of wintering trans-Saharan migratory European birds, and current land-use changes there may represent a threat for these species. We used satellite tracking data from the migratory Montagu's harrier to evaluate habitat use of the species during the wintering season, and whether the current network of protected areas is effective to provide their habitat needs during that season. We also developed an ecological niche model for the species in Western-Central Sahel to check if the most suitable sites are included within current protected areas. Tracked harriers occupied a large region encompassing a total of eight countries. The most preferred habitats during winter were croplands and some natural vegetation habitats, especially grasslands. Protected areas only covered a small proportion of the overall wintering grounds of tracked harriers and the most suitable areas for the species in Western-Central Sahel. Increasing the extent of preferred natural habitats within protected areas should benefit the conservation of this and probably other insect-eating raptors. However, substantial increases in extent and number of protected areas in sub-Saharan Africa are very unlike to occur. Conservation actions in the region should therefore be mostly focused on improving land use planning and management outside protected areas, specially enhancing agricultural practices to make biodiversity conservation compatible with poverty alleviation. These can be chiefly targeted at an area of {\textless}20,000km 2 of very suitable habitat for these species. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Endemics with 10 or more records and spatial uncertainties at {\textless}5 km were extracted from the Central-Apennine floristic geodatabase and the MNP Seed Index. Nine environmental predictor layers were prepared at 90 and 30 m resolution. A stepwise Maximum Entropy (Maxent) model was generated per endemic to achieve the most parsimonious result at an area under the curve {\textgreater} 0.8. Arctic-alpine elevation, edaphic barrens and low open-vegetation, individually or in pairs, were found to be predictive for endemics. Forty-eight endemics, 10 of which exclusive, were recorded and Maxent-predicted for the Majella massif. Subsets of 38 endemics were recorded on other mountains in proportion to their arctic-alpine area, thus conforming to the Island Theory. Maxent confirmed its strengths also at fine resolutions and, in addition, showed to be robust across predictor layers at both resolutions. A linear species-area relationship appeared superior to the Maxent model in predicting the number of endemics per arctic-alpine “island”. Our findings suggest the need for a proactive management of the botanical biodiversity contained in the alpine and montane barrens and low-open vegetation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Societ{\`{a}} Botanica Italiana.},

ACRFs incorporate acoustic context information into an augmented space in order to model the sequential phenomena of the speech signal. The augmented space is constructed using Gaussian activation functions representing the dense regions in the observation space. These activation functions are estimated using the Expectation- Maximization (EM) algorithm. Alternatively, the activation functions can be estimated using a discriminative objective function. Hence, the ACRFs are fed with discriminative features.

The distribution of P. chihuahuana is defined by vegetation type and minimum temperature at national and state scales. At the local scale, both models calculated similar areas for the potential distribution of the species; the variables that better defined the species distribution were vegetation type, aspect and distance to water flows. Populations of P. chihuahuana have always been small, but our results show potential habitat greater than the area of the actual distribution. These results provide an insight into the availability of areas suitable for the species' regeneration, possibly through assisted colonization. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the authors.},

This study utilised surveyed distribution data for Priority Marine Features and modelled distribution data showing potential "Most Suitable" Priority Marine Feature habitat through the species distribution model, Maxent. Prediction indicators were developed through Spearman[U+05F3]s Rank coefficients and a linear regression model. Results showed that, (1) there was a significant negative correlation between the management complexity score within 5. km of a MPA and the number of casework events (defined as any work or statutory consultation associated with an MPA, such as planning applications, discharges or new fisheries); and (2) a significant positive correlation between the number of casework events and location, number of features, and the type of features and most suitable scores. Calculations showed that Lochs Duich, Long and Alsh, Loch Sunart, Loch Sween and Loch Creran may potentially require most effort to manage once they are designated as MPAs. This study showed that it is possible to evaluate options within an MPA network to achieve cost effective options for the biodiversity and socio-economic objectives of MPA networks and that some MPAs are likely to be more efficient than others in terms of management time. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Maxent, on the other hand, is an approach to build an estimated distribution having maximum entropy while obeying a potentially large number of useful features observed in empirical data. The underlying idea of our model is that PARs have suitable characteristics to serve as features for maxent. As a result, our classifier can take advantage of both the useful correlation and confidence of PARs as well as the strong statistical modeling capability of maxent.

abstract = {Within southern Africa, a link between past climatic changes and faunal diversification has been hypothesized for a diversity of taxa. To test the hypothesis that evolutionary divergences may be correlated to vegetation changes (induced by changes in climate), we selected the widely distributed four-striped mouse, Rhabdomys, as a model. Two species are currently recognized, the mesic-adapted R. dilectus and arid-adapted R. pumilio. However, the morphology-based taxonomy and the distribution boundaries of previously described subspecies remain poorly defined. The current study, which spans seven biomes, focuses on the spatial genetic structure of the arid-adapted R. pumilio (521 specimens from 31 localities), but also includes limited sampling of the mesic-adapted R. dilectus (33 specimens from 10 localities) to act as a reference for interspecific variation within the genus. The mitochondrial COI gene and four nuclear introns (Eef1a1, MGF, SPTBN1, Bfib7) were used for the construction of gene trees. Mitochondrial DNA analyses indicate that Rhabdomys consists of four reciprocally monophyletic, geographically structured clades, with three distinct lineages present within the arid-adapted R. pumilio. These monophyletic lineages differ by at least 7.9{\%} (±0.3) and these results are partly confirmed by a multilocus network of the combined nuclear intron dataset. Ecological niche modeling in MaxEnt supports a strong correlation between regional biomes and the distribution of distinct evolutionary lineages of Rhabdomys. A Bayesian relaxed molecular clock suggests that the geographic clades diverged between 3.09 and 4.30. Ma, supporting the hypothesis that the radiation within the genus coincides with paleoclimatic changes (and the establishment of the biomes) characterizing the Miocene-Pliocene boundary. Marked genetic divergence at the mitochondrial DNA level, coupled with strong nuclear and mtDNA signals of non-monophyly of R. pumilio, support the notion that a taxonomic revision of the genus is needed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Aim: Various techniques model a species' niche and potential distribution by comparing the environmental conditions of occurrence localities with those of the overall study region (via a background or pseudoabsence sample). Here, we examine how changes in the extent of the study region (ignored or under-appreciated in most studies) affect models of two rodents, Nephelomys caracolus and Nephelomys meridensis. Location: North-central South America. Methods: We used M. axent to model the species' potential distributions via two methods of defining the study region. In Method 1 (typical of most studies to date), we calibrated the model in a large study region that included the ranges of both species. In Method 2, we calibrated the model using a smaller study region surrounding the localities of the focal species, and then applied it to the larger region. Because the study region of Method 1 is likely to include areas of suitable conditions that are unoccupied because of dispersal limitations and/or biotic interactions, this approach is prone to overfitting to conditions found near the occupied localities. In contrast, Method 2 should avoid such problems but may require further assumptions ('clamping' in M. axent) to make predictions for areas with environmental conditions beyond those found in the smaller study region. For each method, we calculated several measures of geographic interpredictivity between predictions for the species (cross-species AUC, cross-species omission rate, and proportional geographic overlap). Results: Compared with Method 1, Method 2 revealed a larger predicted area for each species, less concentrated around known localities (especially for N. caracolus). It also led to higher cross-species AUC values, lower cross-species omission rates and higher proportions of geographic overlap. Clamping was minimal and occurred primarily in regions unlikely to be suitable. Main conclusions: Method 2 led to more realistic predictions and higher estimates of niche conservatism. Conclusions reached by many studies depend on the selection of an appropriate study region. Although detailed information regarding dispersal limitations and/or biotic interactions will typically be difficult to obtain, consideration of coarse distributional patterns, topography and vegetational zones often should permit delimitation of a much more reasonable study region than the extremely large ones currently in common use. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In order to achieve effective control of tsetse, there is need to produce elaborate plans to guide intervention programmes. A model intended to aid in the planning of intervention programmes and assist a fuller understanding of tsetse distribution was applied, in a pilot study in the Masoka area, Mid-Zambezi valley in Zimbabwe, and targeting two savannah species, Glossina morsitans morsitans and Glossina pallidipes. Methodology/Principal findings: The field study was conducted between March and December 2015 in 105 sites following a standardized grid sampling frame. Presence data were used to study habitat suitability of both species based on climatic and environmental data derived from MODIS and SPOT 5 satellite images. Factors influencing distribution were studied using an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) whilst habitat suitability was predicted using a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model at a spatial resolution of 250 m. Area Under the Curve (AUC), an indicator of model performance, was 0.89 for G. m. morsitans and 0.96 for G. pallidipes. We then used the predicted suitable areas to calculate the probability that flies were really absent from the grid cells where they were not captured during the study based on a probability model using a risk threshold of 0.05. Apart from grid cells where G. m. morsitans and G. pallidipes were captured, there was a high probability of presence in an additional 128 km2and 144 km2respectively. Conclusions/Significance: The modelling process promised to be useful in optimizing the outputs of presence/absence surveys, allowing the definition of tsetse infested areas with improved accuracy. The methodology proposed here can be extended to all the tsetse infested parts of Zimbabwe and may also be useful for other PATTEC national initiatives in other African countries. {\textcopyright} 2017 Chikowore et al.},

In this study, the habitat distribution of D. citri in Mexico was computed with MaxEnt, an inductive, machine-learning program that uses bioclimatic layers and point location data. Geographic distributions of development and population growth rates were determined by fitting a temperature-dependent, nonlinear model and projecting the rates over the target area, using the annual mean temperature as the predictor variable. The results showed that the most suitable regions for habitat of D. citri comprise the Gulf of Mexico states, Yucat{\'{a}}n Peninsula, and areas scattered throughout the Pacific coastal states. Less suitable areas occurred in northern and central states. The most important predictor variables were related to temperature. Development and growth rates had a distribution wider than habitat, reaching some of the northern states of M{\'{e}}xico. Habitat, development, and population growth rates were correlated to each other and with the citrus producing area. These relationships indicated that citrus producing states are within the most suitable regions for the occurrence, development, and population growth of D. citri, therefore increasing the risk of huanglongbing dispersion.},

abstract = {Aim: Species distribution modelling (SDM) allows identification of suitable areas where the species might occur. The Grinnellian approach relates species occurrence to abiotic limiting factors, such as topography and climate, measured at present or averaged over time at large spatial scales, whilst Eltonian approaches relate processes as reproductive rates or species abundance to factors as resource availability or functional traits described at a finer spatio-temporal resolution. In this study, we aimed to compare the performance and reliability achieved by Eltonian and Grinnellian models developed at geographical scale when addressing two questions that may affect species distribution: breeding site selection and historical local extinctions. Location: Spain. Methods: We used a temporal series (1988-2010) of breeding success data of Great Bustards (Otis tarda) across Spain to create: (1) a yearly series of correlative Eltonian models based on satellite data (1-km pixel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index derived from NOAA-AVHRR) as a proxy for resource availability and (2) a static topo-climatic Grinnellian model. We applied two modelling algorithms (MaxEnt and Bootstrapped Generalized Mixed-Effects Models) calibrated and validated across different distributional ranges to investigate breeding success in abiotically suitable areas and recent extinctions within the accessible range. Results: Eltonian models showed higher performance and reliability than Grinnellian models at geographical scale and allowed for comparisons of breeding habitat suitability through the study period. Then, satellite data were a more successful predictor of the species breeding success than topography and climate. Breeding was possible out of the range currently occupied by the species, but habitat suitability was significantly lower in non-occupied areas, on where local extinctions have occurred in recent historical times. Main conclusions: This study highlights the advisability of using remote-sensing explanatory variables at high temporal resolution matched with population fitness data in Eltonian approaches to improve the knowledge of the relationship between realized and potential distributions of the species at geographical scale. This is a fundamental question in biogeography and a key issue for designing comprehensive conservation strategies. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Presence-only data present challenges for selecting thresholds to transform species distribution modeling results into binary outputs. In this article, we compare two recently published threshold selection methods (maxSSS and maxFpb) and examine the effectiveness of the threshold-based prevalence estimation approach. Six virtual species with varying prevalence were simulated within a real landscape in southeastern Australia. Presence-only models were built with DOMAIN, generalized linear model, Maxent, and Random Forest. Thresholds were selected with two methods maxSSS and maxFpb with four presence-only datasets with different ratios of the number of known presences to the number of random points (KP-RPratio). Sensitivity, specificity, true skill statistic, and F measure were used to evaluate the performance of the results. Species prevalence was estimated as the ratio of the number of predicted presences to the total number of points in the evaluation dataset. Thresholds selected with maxFpb varied as the KP-RPratio of the threshold selection datasets changed. Datasets with the KP-RPratio around 1 generally produced better results than scores distant from 1. Results produced by We conclude that maxFpb had specificity too low for very common species using Random Forest and Maxent models. In contrast, maxSSS produced consistent results whichever dataset was used. The estimation of prevalence was almost always biased, and the bias was very large for DOMAIN and Random Forest predictions. We conclude that maxFpb is affected by the KP-RPratio of the threshold selection datasets, but maxSSS is almost unaffected by this ratio. Unbiased estimations of prevalence are difficult to be determined using the threshold-based approach. {\textcopyright} 2016 Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

We aimed to predict the potential geographic range of E. postvittana to better understand the threat of this species in the US and globally. We used the mechanistic simulation modelling method CLIMEX and the correlative niche modelling method Maxent to predict the geographic distribution of E. postvittana in its native range and globally and tested model projections using known invasion data. Different predictor variable data sets and threshold dependent and independent measures of environmental suitability were considered in model evaluation. Models accurately predicted known invasive localities of E. postvittana across the globe. Overall predictions of environmental suitability were largely congruent across models, although there were some notable differences. Ephiphyas postvittana clearly has the potential to establish in many regions of the globe, although some previous analyses of the potential distribution of this species appear overly pessimistic. Additional studies of the biology of this species in invaded areas, including interactions with natural enemies and the capacity to adapt to novel climatic conditions, are ultimately needed to more fully understand its potential economic and environmental impacts. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

HWA colonization of eastern hemlock results in rapid tree mortality. There is a pressing need to accurately determine eastern hemlock distribution in the face of expanding HWA populations to preserve this important forest species. However, efficient modeling of large geographic extents of eastern hemlock habitats to facilitate state-wide HWA management is lacking. We employ two modeling approaches, decision tree classification (based on presence-absence data) and maximum entropy (MaxEnt, based on presence-only data) method, to map eastern hemlock distribution in eastern Kentucky using a comprehensive suite of environmental parameters as predictor variables. Results demonstrate moderate model accuracies around 70{\%}, supporting the practicality of mapping hemlock distribution over extensive regions. Comparison of the two modeling techniques suggests that decision tree classification has higher overall accuracies, while MaxEnt method was more efficient in model construction. In comparison to the decision tree method, MaxEnt suffered from possibly over-fitting as indicated by increased producer's accuracies yet lower user's accuracies. Our study provides useful references for selecting optimized approaches in accordance with study region characteristics and end user's preferences. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Such highly significant structuring of haplotypes among altitudinally and latitudinally stratified population groups is contrary to the expected panmixia in strong flying bats. The null model of concordance in historical demographic patterns across these two Chaerephon species was not supported. Mismatch and Bayesian skyline analyses indicated ancient stable C. atsinanana populations of constant size during the last two major Pleistocene glacial periods, making retreat into and expansion from glacial refugia an unlikely explanation for such high levels of structure, in accordance with expectations for tropical bats. Analyses were consistent with post-refugial population expansion in the less diverse and structured C. leucogaster during the end of the last Pleistocene glacial period. We hypothesise that the pronounced genetic structuring in C. atsinanana may result from female philopatry. Furthermore, differing demographic histories of the two species may have been shaped by differing climate or habitat preferences, consistent with evidence from MaxEnt ecological niche modelling, which shows differences in variables influencing the current predicted distributions. Fossil Quaternary pollen deposits further indicate greater stability in past climatic patterns in eastern versus western Madagascar. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Linnean Society of London.},

For this reason, we studied its geographical distribution within the state, to locate and describe the ecological characteristics of the areas where they have been found, in order to identify potential areas of establishment. The method comprised four stages: 1) the creation of a database with herbarium records, 2) the construction of the potential distribution based on historical herbarium records for the species, using the model of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and 22 bioclimatic variables as predictors; 3) an in situ systematic search of individuals, based on herbarium records and areas of potential distribution in 24 municipalities, to determine the habitat current situation and distribution; 4) the description of the environmental factors of potential ecological niches generated by MaxEnt. A review of herbarium collections revealed a total of 18 records of V. planifolia between 1939 and 1998. The systematic search located 28 plants distributed in 12 sites in 95 364 Km2. The most important variables that determined the model of vanilla potential distribution were: precipitation in the rainy season (61.9 {\%}), soil moisture regime (23.4 {\%}) and precipitation during the four months of highest rainfall (8.1 {\%}). The species potential habitat was found to be distributed in four zones: wet tropics of the Gulf of Mexico, humid temperate, humid tropical, and humid temperate in the Pacific. Precipitation oscillated within the annual ranges of 2 500 to 4 000 mm, with summer rains, and winter precipitation as 5 to 10 {\%} of the total. The moisture regime and predominating climate were udic type I (330 to 365 days of moisture) and hot humid (Am/A(C) m). The plants were located at altitudes of 200 to 1 190 masl, on rough hillsides that generally make up the foothills of mountain systems, with altitudes of 1 300 to 2 500 masl. In natural conditions, distribution of the species is not limited to high evergreen forests, since it was also found in mountain mesophyll and tropical evergreen forests. The location of new specimens of V. planifolia in its wild condition reduces the potential distribution area by 66 {\%}. This area is fragmented into three geographically separated areas. Habitat reduction was due to the increased number of located plants that define the environmental conditions into a more accurate level. Conservation actions can thus be designed and implemented, focusing on more specific areas within the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. {\textcopyright} 2016, Universidad de Costa Rica. All rights reserved.},

Since canopy-dwelling plants have no vascular connection to the ground or their host plants, they are likely more sensitive to environmental changes than their soil-rooted counterparts, subsequently regarded as one of the groups most vulnerable to global climate change. Epiphytes have adapted to life in highly dynamic forest canopies by producing many, mostly wind-dispersed, seeds or spores. Consequently, epiphytes should colonize trees rapidly, which, in addition to atmospheric sensitivity and short life cycles, make epiphytes suitable climate change indicators.

abstract = {Among the greatest challenges facing the conservation of plants and animal species in protected areas are threats from a rapidly changing climate. An altered climate creates both challenges and opportunities for improving the management of protected areas in networks. Increasingly, quantitative tools like species distribution modeling are used to assess the performance of protected areas and predict potential responses to changing climates for groups of species, within a predictive framework. At larger geographic domains and scales, protected area network units have spatial geoclimatic properties that can be described in the gap analysis typically used to measure or aggregate the geographic distributions of species (stacked species distribution models, or S-SDM). We extend the use of species distribution modeling techniques in order to model the climate envelope (or "footprint") of individual protected areas within a network of protected areas distributed across the 48 conterminous United States and managed by the US National Park System. In our approach we treat each protected area as the geographic range of a hypothetical endemic species, then use MaxEnt and 5 uncorrelated BioClim variables to model the geographic distribution of the climatic envelope associated with each protected area unit (modeling the geographic area of park units as the range of a species). We describe the individual and aggregated climate envelopes predicted by a large network of 163 protected areas and briefly illustrate how macroecological measures of geodiversity can be derived from our analysis of the landscape ecological context of protected areas. To estimate trajectories of change in the temporal distribution of climatic features within a protected area network, we projected the climate envelopes of protected areas in current conditions onto a dataset of predicted future climatic conditions. Our results suggest that the climate envelopes of some parks may be locally unique or have narrow geographic distributions, and are thus prone to future shifts away from the climatic conditions in these parks in current climates. In other cases, some parks are broadly similar to large geographic regions surrounding the park or have climatic envelopes that may persist into near-term climate change. Larger parks predict larger climatic envelopes, in current conditions, but on average the predicted area of climate envelopes are smaller in our single future conditions scenario. Individual units in a protected area network may vary in the potential for climate adaptation, and adaptive management strategies for the network should account for the landscape contexts of the geodiversity or climate diversity within individual units. Conservation strategies, including maintaining connectivity, assessing the feasibility of assisted migration and other landscape restoration or enhancements can be optimized using analysis methods to assess the spatial properties of protected area networks in biogeographic and macroecological contexts. {\textcopyright} 2017 Robinson, Fordyce.

In this paper, we propose the application of SDMs to assess the extinction-risk of plant species in relation to the spread of greenhouses in a Mediterranean landscape, where habitat depletion is one of the main causes of biodiversity loss. For this purpose, presence records of the model species (Linaria nigricans, a endemic and threatened species) and the greenhouses, a dataset of environmental variables, and different only presence-based modelling algorithms (Bioclim, Domain, GARP, MaxEnt and ENFA) were used to build SDMs for L. nigricans as well as for greenhouses. To evaluate the models a modified approach of the area-under-curve ROC was applied. Combining the most accurate models, we generated an extinction-risk model of L. nigricans populations, which enabled us to assess the sustainability of the most threatened populations. Our results show that is possible to model greenhouses spreading as a "biological invasion". The procedure explained and used in this work is quite novel, and offers an objective spatial criterion intended for the management of natural resources and for the conservation of the biodiversity in areas threatened by habitat depletion processes as particular as greenhouses expansion. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

Otomops madagascariensis from the dry portions of Madagascar is widely recognised to be a distinct species. Based on mitochondrial DNA sequences of the cytochrome b gene (1,004 base pairs; n = 50) and the control region (D-loop, 290 base pairs; n = 52), two Oriental outgroup species (O. wroughtoni and O. cf.formosus) formed a monophyletic clade that was the sister group to the Afro-Malagasy taxa, composed of O. martiensseni and O. madagascariensis. Within the Afro-Malagasy clade, we discovered three well-supported but genetically similar clades (inter-clade genetic distances of 3.4-4.4{\%}) from 1) north-eastern Africa and Arabia, 2) African mainland except northeast Africa, and 3) Madagascar. Taken together, haplotype networks, estimated divergence times, regional species richness and historical demographic data tentatively suggested dispersal from Asia to Africa and Madagascar. To understand ecological determinants of phylogeographic, biogeographic and genetic structure, we assessed the potential distribution of O. martiensseni throughout sub-Saharan Africa with ecological niche modelling (MaxEnt) based on known point localities (n = 60). The species is predicted to occur mainly in woodlands and forests and in areas of rough topography. Continuity of suitable habitats supported our inferred high levels of continental gene flow (relatively low genetic distances), and suggested that factors other than habitat suitability have resulted in the observed phylogeographic structure (e.g., seasonal mass migrations of insects that might be tracked by these bats). Based on a Bayesian relaxed clock approach and two fossil calibration dates, we estimated that African and Oriental c]ades diverged at 4.2 Mya, Malagasy and African clades at 1.5 Mya, and African clades 1 and 2 at 1.2 Mya. Integrating phylogenetic, phylogeographic, population genetic and ecological approaches holds promise for a better understanding of biodiversity patterns and evolutionary processes. {\textcopyright} Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.},

However, ten species and up to five candidate species have been recognized recently. For these taxa, ecological information is scarce and distribution ranges are often only incompletely known. In this study, ecological niche spaces were estimated for eight Pelomedusa species, using a maximum entropy algorithm and geographical, climatic, and topographic information. Using the obtained models and Schoener's D and Hellinger's I indices, areas of sympatry between species were estimated and candidate areas for possibly overlooked taxa were identified. Furthermore, differences in niche spaces between species were assessed. The ecological niche models revealed geographical spaces that match the predicted niche of the eight examined species. However, for P. subrufa sensu stricto, the distribution range of the introduced populations in Madagascar was not predicted. Our models, together with statistical analyses, indicate that the studied Pelomedusa species occupy different geographical spaces. Areas of sympatry with significant niche overlap were identified between some species pairs. Yet, Pelomedusa species are generally allopatrically or parapatrically distributed. A minimum of five candidate regions possibly harbouring unknown taxa were identified. Our results provide a better understanding of the distribution ranges of Pelomedusa species and, thus, can serve as a basis for conservation planning. {\textcopyright} 2016 Deutsche Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r Herpetologie und Terrarienkunde e.V.

Chamaecyparis formosensis (Taiwan red cypress, TRC) only grows in Huisun's Shou-Cheng Mountain. We used GIS to overlay physiographic variables and vegetation index with TRC samples. We developed ENMs by using generalized linear model (GLM), maximum likelihood (ML), maximum entropy (MAXENT) and BIOCLIM. Results indicated that the accuracies of four models increased linearly with the sample size and also the mean kappa value of SPA methods (0.95) was better than that of SPO methods (0.85) for predicting the suitable habitat of TRC forests in the study. The variables used except elevation could not reflect the relationship between humidity and topographic sheltering characteristics (wind). Hence, we proposed a hypothesis: northeastern seasonal wind with humidity cannot fully blow into Huisun due to its topographic sheltering effects. We will attempt to incorporate proxy indicators of wind and humidity into models. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {The potential distribution was determined for eight exotic species which are invasive in Baja California (Atriplex semibaccata, Brassica tournefortii, Bromus rubens, Centaurea melitensis, Cynodon dactylon, Salsola tragus, Schismus barbatus, and Tamarix ramosissima) with MaxEnt modeling program. To do this we used 19 climate variables and the known distribution of the species obtained from herbarium records. All models were evaluated to test their predictive ability and analyzed the most important climate variables in the predictive model for each species. The coastal region of the northwest (Mediterranean area) was identified as the area of the highest probability of occurrence for the species studied. This may be because it is a region where historically the floristic exchange (mainly from the European Mediterranean region) has been more intensive and where anthropogenic activity is greater. Probably, these species have also had a better adaptation to the climatic conditions of this area and some extending their distribution to more arid areas (desert) of the state. This is the first study done in Baja California considering exotic species and their invasive potential distribution by models. These models, defined with the current information available, can assist in determining the most important concentration sites of these species.},

abstract = {Population of Flindersia pimenteliana (Maple Silkwood) in Indonesian Papua and Papua New Guinea is severely fragmented and experiencing a continuing decline due to habitat destruction and illegal logging. This species is very susceptible to environmental changes and at greater risk of extinction due to its small and fragmented geographic ranges and low abundance. Using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) method, the present study predicted the impact of climate change on the distribution of the species across its native distribution area. Elevation and 19 bioclimatic variables commonly used in species distribution modeling were used as predictors. The prediction model of the current potential distribution identified a total area of 156,214 km in Indonesian Papua and Papua New Guinea (18{\%} of total land area) as suitable habitat for F pimenteliana. Elevation and precipitation of the wettest, coldest and warmest quarters contributed most to the model. Based on the average of HadGEM2-ES and MIROC-ESM models, potential distribution projections under RCP8.5 scenario suggested a habitat gain of 16{\%} for 2050 and 8{\%} for 2070 in the species distribution. Whereas under RCP4.5, an average habitat gain of 7{\%} was predicted for both 2050 and 2070. The newly suitable habitats were predicted to be found mainly in Southern and Western Highland of Papua New Guinea. Protection of these areas from habitat destruction and land use change is needed to assist Fpimenteliana find the most suitable climate for its survival.},

abstract = {One of the most important tools in conservation biology is information on the geographic distribution of species and the variables determining those patterns. We used maximum-entropy niche modeling to run distribution models for 222 amphibian and 371 reptile species (49{\%} endemics and 27{\%} threatened) for which we had 34,619 single geographic records. The planning region is in southeastern Mexico, is 20{\%} of the country's area, includes 80{\%} of the country's herpetofauna, and lacks an adequate protected-area system. We used probabilistic data to build distribution models of herpetofauna for use in prioritizing conservation areas for three target groups (all species and threatened and endemic species). The accuracy of species-distribution models was better for endemic and threatened species than it was for all species. Forty-seven percent of the region has been deforested and additional conservation areas with 13.7{\%} to 88.6{\%} more native vegetation (76{\%} to 96{\%} of the areas are outside the current protected-area system) are needed. There was overlap in 26 of the main selected areas in the conservation-area network prioritized to preserve the target groups, and for all three target groups the proportion of vegetation types needed for their conservation was constant: 30{\%} pine and oak forests, 22{\%} tropical evergreen forest, 17{\%} low deciduous forest, and 8{\%} montane cloud forests. The fact that different groups of species require the same proportion of habitat types suggests that the pine and oak forests support the highest proportion of endemic and threatened species and should therefore be given priority over other types of vegetation for inclusion in the protected areas of southeastern Mexico. {\textcopyright}2010 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {Aim To explore whether the subspecific genetic entities of Acacia saligna occupy different bioclimatic niches in their native and introduced ranges and whether these niches are predictable using species distribution models (SDMs). Location Australia, South Africa and the Mediterranean Basin. Methods Species distribution models were developed in MAXENT using six climatic variables to calculate the climatic suitability of the ranges of A. saligna. We assessed (1) the subspecific niche differences identified by SDMs using measures of niche overlap and model performance; (2) the ability of SDMs to predict the most likely subspecific genetic entities present in South Africa based on comparisons to genetic data; and (3) the ability of SDMs to predict the most likely subspecific genetic entities present in the Mediterranean Basin. All model projections were assessed for sensitivity and modelled prevalence as indicators of model fit and predictability. Results The SDMs identified different subspecific bioclimatic niches in the native range. Sensitivity and modelled prevalence show that none of the models correctly predicted the full range of A. saligna in South Africa or the Mediterranean Basin. Models also show that the South African niche is different to that in the native range. Main conclusions Subspecies of A. saligna occupy quantifiably distinct bioclimatic niches in their native ranges, implying that they should occupy distinct niches in their invasive ranges. However, projections to the introduced range did not correspond with known occurrences. Our SDMs are unable to predict the full introduced niche of A. saligna at a species or subspecies level in either South Africa or the Mediterranean Basin. Range limits in the native and introduced ranges may be determined by additional factors not used in the SDMs developed in this study. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The European Union and Germany aims to increase the share of renewables. Thus, new and sustainable hydropower solutions are discussed in detail. Simultaneously, the EuropeanWater Framework Directive (WFD) prohibits the degradation of rivers, which leads to the need of river continuity concepts and new fish friendly hydropower concepts that do not (significantly) impact connectivity and continuity. Migratory obstacles, particularly in the formof hydropower plants, have a significant impact on aquatic ecosystems. In order to ensure efficient energy production that does not interfere with river ecology, but provides a reasonable contribution to the power supply, fish and water protection measures are indispensable. However, there is a need for comprehensive research, in the areas of fish protection and fish decline, particularly in the fields of behavioral and population biology of both diadromous and potamodromous species. These knowledge gaps have significant consequences for the acceptance of measures for fish protection, fish migration and consequently as well for the extension or upgrading of hydropower. This paper presents an innovative assessment approach by development of a model that links physical habitat conditions and ecological requirements of species communities and different life stages using a habitat modelling software (MaxEnt) and a dispersal modelling software (FIDIMO) to derive priorities for protected reaches. As a first step we demonstrate that reliable spatial predictions for key fish species can be achieved by modelling habitat suitability with species occurrence data and public available hydromorphological variables. {\textcopyright} 2016 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, London.},

abstract = {It is often desirable to quantify a plant's relative weediness or synanthropy, that is, the degree to which aspecies associates with human-caused disturbance, in order to study and understand the biology, ecology and evolutionof weeds and invasive plants. Herbarium specimens are among the most accessible and verifiable sources of data ondistribution and habitat. However, the habitat distribution of species may not be reflected accurately by herbariumspecimendata, due towell-known biases in plant collection. Here, we assess how well herbariumspecimens reflect species'weediness, when compared with direct field surveys. We used five species of Melampodium (Asteraceae) and classifiedtheir degree ofweediness with amodification of Nuorteva's synanthropy index, based on herbariumspecimens. We thenmodelled the distribution of our focal species inMexico usingMaxEnt and identified a polygon of ∼3000 km2 in the stateof Nayarit, Mexico, where there was a high probability of finding all five species. Systematic field searches in the targetarea documented all visible populations of four species along major and minor roads. Then we, again, classified theirdegree of weediness with the synanthropy index, based now on field data, and compared. We found that herbariumdata were an accurate predictor of a species' weediness relative to its congeners despite the well-documented skewof herbarium data towards natural areas, which our data reflected as well. So, herbarium data can be used to classifyspecies' weediness relative to each other, but not in absolute terms, if the specimens were correctly identified and noneof the species were subject to particular collection bias. This study is the first attempt to compare herbarium and fielddata on this subject and may be relevant for other types of investigations based on herbarium data. Our work also highlightsthe usefulness of distribution models based on herbarium specimens. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2015.},

abstract = {Lilium lancifolium, the tiger lily, constitutes a polyploid complex with both diploids (reproduced by seeds and bulbils) and triploids (propagated exclusively via bulbils). An autopolyploid origin for the triploid forms has been previously suggested based on classical cytogenetics, chromosome mapping techniques, ecological data, and geographic distribution in their native range (Korea and the Japanese Tsushima Island). Using 13 allozyme loci, we comparatively assessed clonal structure and levels of genetic diversity in four diploid and 11 triploid populations in South Korea to test the autopolyploid origin of the triploid cytotype and to infer which seedling recruitment strategy is operating within the diploid populations. We also employed ecological niche modeling and multivariate analysis to determine whether triploids of L. lancifolium occupy different and broader niches to those of diploids in Korea and Tsushima Island. The diploids harbored higher levels of within-population genetic diversity than triploids, and allele profiles found in triploids were exactly subsets of those in diploids. Repeated seedling recruitment was inferred for the diploids, whereas all the studied triploid populations were monoclonal since there is no seedling (sexual) recruitment. Although we found no niche divergence between cytotypes of L. lancifolium, the triploids have a broader niche breadth. Genetic data further confirm the autotriploid origin of L. lancifolium, and the lack of a clear, strong evidence for niche divergence between cytotypes of L. lancifolium supports the view that ecological differentiation is not a pre-requisite for the establishment of new polyploid lineages. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Geophagy is well known among some Neotropical parrots. The clay apparently adsorbs dietary toxins and/or provides supplemental nutrients. We used location data and 23 environmental layers to develop a predictive model of claylick distribution using Maxent software. We related species characteristics to claylick use and examined how parrot assemblages using claylicks changed with distance from the centre of claylick distribution. Fifty-two parrot claylicks were reported from an area of ca 4 million km2 but over 50{\%} were restricted to a 35 000 km2 region of southeast Peru and northern Bolivia. Claylicks were strongly associated with moist forest on younger ({\textless}65 millions of yr) geological formations and exposed river banks. The predictive model of claylick distribution matched our reported range well, with precipitation of warmest quarter, land cover, temperature seasonality, and distance from the ocean being most important predictors of claylick presence. Twenty-six of the region's 46 parrot species visited claylicks. Species differed greatly in their lick use, but body size, dietary breadth, abundance and other traits were poor predictors of lick use. We are confident that our survey identified the distribution of major parrot claylicks in South America, although less conspicuous parrot geophagy may occur elsewhere. We suggest that claylick distribution reflects both underlying geology (allowing claylick formation in only some regions) and the physiological need for geophagy among parrots in different parts of the continent. Data on the latter are inconclusive, but we argue that parrot claylick distribution supports the contention that geophagy is related more to sodium deficiencies than to protection from dietary toxins. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.},

abstract = {One of the most contentious theories in current ecology is the ecological niche conservatism, which is defined as conservatism among closely related species; however, the ecological niche can also be shifted, as documented in several cases. Genetic drift and ecological divergent selection may cause ecological niche divergence. The current study aims to test whether the ecological niche is conserved or divergent and to determine the main factor that drives ecological niche divergence or conservation. We analyzed the phylogenetic relationship, ecological niche model (ENM) and demographic history of Eared Pheasants in the genus Crossoptilon (Galliformes: Phasianidae) to test niche conservatism with respect to different geographically distributed patterns. The phylogenetic relationship was reconstructed using ∗BEAST with mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) and 44 unlinked autosomal exonic loci, and ENMs were reconstructed in MAXENT using an average of 41 occurrence sites in each species and 22 bioclimatic variables. A background similarity test was used to detect whether the ecological niche is conserved. Demographic history was estimated using the isolation with migration (IM) model. We found that there was asymmetric gene flow between the allopatric sister species Crossoptilon mantchuricum and C. auritum and the parapatric sister species C. harmani and C. crossoptilon. We found that ecological niches were divergent, not conserved, between C. mantchuricum and C. auritum, which began to diverge at approximately 0.3 million years ago. However, the ecological niches were conserved between C. crossoptilon and C. harmani, which gradually diverged approximately half a million years ago. Ecological niches can be either conserved or divergent, and ecological divergent selection for local adaptation is probably an important factor that promotes and maintains niche divergence in the face of gene flow. This study provides a better understanding of the role that divergent selection has in the initial speciation process. The platform combined demographic processes and ecological niches to offer new insights into the mechanism of biogeography patterns. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the geographical distribution of timber tree species in the Amazon is still scarce. This is especially true at the local level, thereby limiting natural resource management actions. Forest inventories are key sources of information on the occurrence of such species. However, areas with approved forest management plans are mostly located near access roads and the main industrial centers. The present study aimed to assess the spatial scale effects of forest inventories used as sources of occurrence data in the interpolation of potential species distribution models. The occurrence data of a group of six forest tree species were divided into four geographical areas during the modeling process. Several sampling schemes were then tested applying the maximum entropy algorithm, using the following predictor variables: elevation, slope, exposure, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and height above the nearest drainage (HAND). The results revealed that using occurrence data from only one geographical area with unique environmental characteristics increased both model overfitting to input data and omission error rates. The use of a diagonal systematic sampling scheme and lower threshold values led to improved model performance. Forest inventories may be used to predict areas with a high probability of species occurrence, provided they are located in forest management plan regions representative of the environmental range of the model projection area. {\textcopyright} 2016, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

We used accurately recorded occurrence records and ecological niche modelling to predict the distribution of two threatened and poorly known small carnivore species that occur in Southeast Asia, the banded civet (Hemigalus derbyanus) and Hose's civet (Diplogale hosei), and analysed their spatial niche differentiation for habitat and elevation. We then identified possible anthropogenic threats, and used our modelling predictions to recommend surveying priorities. The predicted distribution of the banded civet was principally in lowland evergreen forest in southern Myanmar/Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo and three Mentawai Islands (Siberut, Sipora and South Pagai), and for Hose's civet in evergreen forest across the higher elevation regions of Borneo. Our niche analyses suggested that there is a tendency for these two species to separate spatially along an elevation gradient: the banded civet is mainly found in lowland areas, whereas Hose's civet primarily occurs at higher elevations. Our study strongly indicated that these two viverrids are forest-dependent species that may be threatened by forest loss, degradation and fragmentation. Field surveys should be prioritised in areas where each species is predicted to occur and no records currently exist.},

abstract = {Aim: To contribute directly to Norway's national and international commitments to systematic, long-term conservation of crop wild relatives (CWR) by ensuring both the in situ and ex situ protection and availability of a broad range of CWR genetic diversity within the country. Location: Norway. Methods: We created a priority list of CWR within Norway based upon four main criteria including economic value from national to global level of associated crops and inclusion in Annex 1 of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA). Species presence data were gathered from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and used for predictive species distribution modelling in MaxEnt. capfitogen software was utilized to create an ecogeographic land characterization (ELC) map and to identify complementary in situ genetic reserves and ex situ collecting priorities which target the full range of ecogeographic diversity of taxa. Results: An inventory of 204 priority CWR within Norway was compiled. A grid cell complementary network of 19 in situ areas ({\~{}}10 km2) conserved 201 priority CWR, and a separate analysis identified a protected area complementary network of 23 reserves that conserved 181 priority taxa. For ex situ conservation, 177 taxa did not have ex situ accessions and of the 24 with accessions, 15 had the minimum of five populations conserved throughout their ecogeographic range. Main conclusions: We present the first comprehensive national recommendations for in situ and ex situ conservation of 204 priority CWR in Norway. Proposals target the conservation of the ecogeographic diversity of the priority CWR and hence their genetic diversity. Both the priority taxa and the methodology used are applicable at regional and global scales with the recommendations not only helping Norway to meet its international obligations for conservation of genetic diversity of CWR but also ensuring this genetic diversity is available for use in tackling global food security. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Aspalathus linearis (Burm. f.) R. Dahlgren (rooibos) is endemic to the Fynbos Biome of South Africa, which is an internationally recognized biodiversity hot spot. Rooibos is both an invaluable wild resource and commercially cultivated crop in suitable areas. Climate change predictions for the region indicate a significant warming scenario coupled with a decline in winter rainfall. First estimates of possible consequences for biodiversity point to species extinctions of 23{\%} in the long term in the Fynbos Biome. Bioclimatic modelling using the maximum entropy method was used to develop an estimate of the realized niche of wild rooibos and the current geographic distribution of areas suitable for commercially production. The distribution modelling provided a good match to the known distribution and production area of A. linearis. An ensemble of global climate models that assume the A2 emissions scenario of high energy requirements was applied to develop possible scenarios of range/suitability shift under future climate conditions. When these were extrapolated to a future climate (2041-2070) both wild and cultivated tea exhibited substantial range contraction with some range shifts southeastwards and upslope. Most of the areas where range expansion was indicated are located in existing conservation areas or include conservation worthy vegetation. These findings will be critical in directing conservation efforts as well as developing strategies for farmers to cope with and adapt to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {The objective of this work was to determine the potential distribution of 23 pioneer species in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, as well as to identify the environmental variables that influence their distributions. The Maxent algorithm was chosen to associate the occurrence of species with the following bioclimatic variables: diurnal temperature variation, isothermality, temperature seasonality, driest month precipitation, precipitation seasonality (coefficient of variation), and actual evapotranspiration. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), flora conservation status, and the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation types were also evaluated, besides erodibility (susceptibility of soil to erosion), groundwater availability, soil texture, organic matter content, mineral occurrence (existing mineral species by lithological unit), pedological simplified map, slope and altitude. The species Anadenanthera colubrina was the most suitable for the Caatinga biome, followed by Casearia sylvestris and Plathymenia reticulate, indicated for the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado biomes, respectively. The use of Maxent is recommended as a tool to guide conservation plans that require the indication of species, aiming to recover degraded or deforested vegetation areas.},

Using known distribution localities and 14 environmental variables, the Maxent and Domain species distribution models were employed to map the patterns of geographic distribution. The power of predictability of the models was tested using the receiver operating characteristic method and the jackknife validation approach, according to the different number of species localities available. The estimated richness and the superimposed potential distributions of 13 genera were used to indicate endemic patterns of distribution. The comparison of Maxent and Domain further identified previously unknown areas of endemism and described the distribution for each taxon. Both observed species occurrence and the species occurrence predicted from the Maxent indicated that the eastern Alashan of Inner Mongolia is the most noticeable endemic area, and the northwestern and northern Tarim Basin of Xinjiang is the secondary center of plant diversity. These regions were then prioritized for conservation importance. Potential evapotranspiration ratio and precipitation seasonality played important roles in driving the observed patterns of endemic distribution. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {MAXENT is now a common species distribution modeling (SDM) tool used by conservation practitioners for predicting the distribution of a species from a set of records and environmental predictors. However, datasets of species occurrence used to train the model are often biased in the geographical space because of unequal sampling effort across the study area. This bias may be a source of strong inaccuracy in the resulting model and could lead to incorrect predictions. Although a number of sampling bias correction methods have been proposed, there is no consensual guideline to account for it. We compared here the performance of five methods of bias correction on three datasets of species occurrence: one "virtual" derived from a land cover map, and two actual datasets for a turtle (Chrysemys picta) and a salamander (Plethodon cylindraceus). We subjected these datasets to four types of sampling biases corresponding to potential types of empirical biases. We applied five correction methods to the biased samples and compared the outputs of distribution models to unbiased datasets to assess the overall correction performance of each method. The results revealed that the ability of methods to correct the initial sampling bias varied greatly depending on bias type, bias intensity and species. However, the simple systematic sampling of records consistently ranked among the best performing across the range of conditions tested, whereas other methods performed more poorly in most cases. The strong effect of initial conditions on correction performance highlights the need for further research to develop a step-by-step guideline to account for sampling bias. However, this method seems to be the most efficient in correcting sampling bias and should be advised in most cases. {\textcopyright} 2014 Fourcade et al.},

abstract = {We explored the applied use of distribution modelling as a tool for making spatial predictions of occurrences of the red-listed vascular plant species Scorzonera humilis in a study area in southeast Norway. Scorzonera is typical of extensively managed semi-natural grasslands. A Maxent model was trained on all known records of the species, accurately georeferenced and gridded to fine resolution (grid cells of 25×25m). Model performance was assessed on the training data by data-splitting (by which some records were set off for evaluation) and on independent evaluation data collected in the field. Of the eight predictor variables used in the modelling, distance to roads and to arable land were most important followed by land-cover class and altitude. Judged from the area under curve (AUC), the model was good to excellent and a significant, positive relationship was found between relative probabilities of occurrence predicted by the model and true probability of presence provided by the independently collected evaluation data. The model was used together with the evaluation data to estimate presence of Scorzonera humilis in 0.7{\%} of the grid cells in the study area. The grid cells in which the model predicted highest probability for Scorzonera to be present had a true probability of presence of ca 12{\%}, i.e. 17×higher than in an average cell. The present study demonstrates that, even when only simple predictor variables are available, spatial prediction modelling contributes important knowledge about rare species such as prevalence estimates, spatial prediction maps and insights into the species' autecology. Spatial prediction modelling also makes cost-efficient monitoring of rare species possible. However, it is pointed out that these benefits require evaluation of the model on independently sampled evaluation data. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.},

abstract = {There is a growing concern regarding the conservation status of amphibian species worldwide; they are more threatened and declining more rapidly than mammals or birds, and Mexico is considered one of the richest countries on Earth in terms of reptile and amphibian species. Composite models of the current distribution patterns of endemic amphibians in western Mexico were used to predict their potential distributional changes as a consequence of expected climatic changes. The models identified the most significant conservation areas within the region (hotspots), considering existing natural protected areas (NPAs) and previously recognized terrestrial priority regions for conservation (TPRCs). Three niche modelling algorithms (Bioclim, GARP and MaxEnt) used 2412 locality records for 29 species to model their climate envelopes under current and future conditions for the years 2020, 2050 and 2080. The models indicated that overall species persistence was 60{\%} for the years 2020 and 2050, but dropped to {\textless} 20{\%} by the year 2080. The current network of NPAs included only 8{\%} of the areas that currently possess the greatest predicted potential richness (16-21 species), and, by 2050, the models indicate they will encompass only 3{\%} of these areas. Six TPRCs included 44{\%} of currently predicted areas with the highest potential species richness, but, by 2050, models predicted only 3{\%} of such areas would persist within one TPRC. Higher uncertainty levels and variability among species surrounded the 2080 projections generated by the three algorithms. Recognition of the potential effects of climate change and consideration of the conservation value of the six TPRCs identified in this study may counteract the potential consequences of climate change on biodiversity in Mexico.

abstract = {Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations are placing spatially divergent stresses on the world's tropical coral reefs through increasing ocean surface temperatures and ocean acidification. We show how these two stressors combine to alter the global habitat suitability for shallow coral reef ecosystems, using statistical Bioclimatic Envelope Models rather than basing projections on any a priori assumptions of physiological tolerances or fixed thresholds. We apply two different modeling approaches (Maximum Entropy and Boosted Regression Trees) with two levels of complexity (one a simplified and reduced environmental variable version of the other). Our models project a marked temperature-driven decline in habitat suitability for many of the most significant and bio-diverse tropical coral regions, particularly in the central Indo-Pacific. This is accompanied by a temperature-driven poleward range expansion of favorable conditions accelerating up to 40-70 km per decade by 2070. We find that ocean acidification is less influential for determining future habitat suitability than warming, and its deleterious effects are centered evenly in both hemispheres between 5° and 20° latitude. Contrary to expectations, the combined impact of ocean surface temperature rise and acidification leads to little, if any, degradation in future habitat suitability across much of the Atlantic and areas currently considered 'marginal' for tropical corals, such as the eastern Equatorial Pacific. These results are consistent with fossil evidence of range expansions during past warm periods. In addition, the simplified models are particularly sensitive to short-term temperature variations and their projections correlate well with reported locations of bleaching events. Our approach offers new insights into the relative impact of two global environmental pressures associated with rising atmospheric CO2 on potential future habitats, but greater understanding of past and current controls on coral reef ecosystems is essential to their conservation and management under a changing climate. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {This study applied ecological niche models to determine the potential invasive range of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, with a particular focus on river systems in southern Africa where it is now established and spreading. Computational tools such as niche models are useful in predicting the potential range of invasive species, but there are limitations to their application. In particular, models trained on native records may fail to predict the full extent of an invasion. This failure is often attributed to changes in either the niche of the invading species or the variables used to develop the models. In this study, we therefore evaluated the differences in the predictive power of models trained with different environmental variables, the effect of species range (native vs. introduced) on model performance and assessed whether or not there is evidence suggestive of a niche shift in Nile tilapia following its introduction. Niche models were constructed using Maxent and the degree of niche similarity was assessed using Schoener's index. Null models were used to test for significance. Model performance and niche conservatism varied significantly with variable selection and species range. This indicates that the environmental conditions available to Nile tilapia in its native and introduced ranges are not congruent. Nile tilapia exhibited broad invasive potential over most of southern Africa that overlaps the natural range of endemic congenerics. Of particular concern are areas which are free of exotic species but are now vulnerable due to the promotion of fish introductions mainly for aquaculture and sport fishing. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Area of Occupancy (AOO), is a measure of species geographical ranges commonly used for species red listing. In most cases, AOO is estimated using reported localities of species distributions at coarse grain resolution, providing measures subjected to uncertainties of data quality and spatial resolution. To illustrate the ability of fine-resolution species distribution models for obtaining new measures of species ranges and their impact in conservation planning, we estimate the potential AOO of an endangered species in alpine environments. We use field occurrences of relict Empetrum nigrum and maximum entropy modeling to assess whether different sampling (expert versus systematic surveys) may affect AOO estimates based on habitat suitability maps, and the differences between such measurements and traditional coarse-grid methods. Fine-scale models performed robustly and were not influenced by survey protocols, providing similar habitat suitability outputs with high spatial agreement. Model-based estimates of potential AOO were significantly smaller than AOO measures obtained from coarse-scale grids, even if the first were obtained from conservative thresholds based on the Minimal Predicted Area (MPA). As defined here, the potential AOO provides spatially-explicit measures of species ranges which are permanent in the time and scarcely affected by sampling bias. The overestimation of these measures may be reduced using higher thresholds of habitat suitability, but standard rules as the MPA permit comparable measures among species. We conclude that estimates of AOO based on fine-resolution distribution models are more robust tools for risk assessment than traditional systems, allowing a better understanding of species ranges at habitat level. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Efficient delineation of conservation areas is a great challenge in maintaining biodiversity. Kernel density estimators (KDEs) are a powerful tool in this perspective, but they have not been applied at the population level on patch-distributed organisms. This would be particularly worthy for species that need broad habitats beyond those where they can be sampled; such as terrestrial lands for pond-breeding amphibians. The aim of this study was to compare different approaches for the identification of suitable areas for conservation: KDE, ecological niche modelling, and a combination of KDE and niche models. Paedomorphosis was chosen as a model system because this is an important form of intraspecific variation that is present in numerous taxa, but geographically localized within species and globally endangered. 277 ponds were sampled in one of the hotspots of paedomorphosis to determine the abundance and distribution of paedomorphs (i.e., individuals retaining gills at the adult stage) of the palmate newt (Lissotriton helveticus), with emphasis on the connections between the most valuable populations. KDEs gave insights into the surface areas required to balance the maintenance of certain number of connected ponds and the respective number of disjoint areas in which the whole population is divided. The inclusion of barriers in the models helped in accurately designing the limits of the areas to protect. Alone, habitat models were not able to successfully delineate the area to protect, but the integration between terrestrial suitable areas or barriers and KDE allowed an objective identification of areas required for conservation. Overall, the best performance was observed by the KDE integrating ecological barriers, and by the combination between KDE and niche modelling. In a broader perspective, KDEs are thus a pertinent tool in providing quantitative spatial measurements to delineate conservation areas based on patch-abundance data with a specific focus to connectivity. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Species distribution modeling is widely used to map the current potential distribution of species as well as to model the impact of future climate change on distribution of species. Mapping current distribution is useful for conservation planning and understanding the change in distribution impacted by climate change is important for mitigation of future biodiversity losses. However, the current distribution of Chinese caterpillar fungus, a flagship species of the Himalaya with very high economic value, is unknown. Nor do we know the potential changes in suitable habitat of Chinese caterpillar fungus caused by future climate change. We used MaxEnt modeling to predict current distribution and changes in the future distributions of Chinese caterpillar fungus in three future climate change trajectories based on representative concentration pathways (RCPs: RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 6.0) in three different time periods (2030, 2050, and 2070) using species occurrence points, bioclimatic variables, and altitude. About 6.02{\%} (8,989 km2) area of the Nepal Himalaya is suitable for Chinese caterpillar fungus habitat. Our model showed that across all future climate change trajectories over three different time periods, the area of predicted suitable habitat of Chinese caterpillar fungus would expand, with 0.11-4.87{\%} expansion over current suitable habitat. Depending upon the representative concentration pathways, we observed both increase and decrease in average elevation of the suitable habitat range of the species. {\textcopyright} 2014 Shrestha, Bawa.},

abstract = {Global climate change is now regarded as imposing a significant threat of enhancing transmission of parasitic diseases. Maximum entropy species distribution modeling (MaxEnt) was used to explore how projected climate change could affect the potential distribution of the carcinogenic liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, in Thailand. A range of climate variables was used: the Hadley Global Environment Model 2—Earth System (HadGEM2-ES) climate change model and also the IPCC scenarios A2a for 2050 and 2070. Occurrence data from surveys conducted in 2009 and 2014 were obtained from the Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. The MaxEnt model performed better than random for O. viverrini with training AUC values greater than 0.8 under current and future climatic conditions. The current distribution of O. viverrini is significantly affected by precipitation and minimum temperature. According to current conditions, parts of Thailand climatically suitable for O. viverrini are mostly in the northeast and north, but the parasite is largely absent from southern Thailand. Under future climate change scenarios, the distribution of O. viverrini in 2050 should be significantly affected by precipitation, maximum temperature, and mean temperature of the wettest quarter, whereas in 2070, significant factors are likely to be precipitation during the coldest quarter, maximum, and minimum temperatures. Maps of predicted future distribution revealed a drastic decrease in presence of O. viverrini in the northeast region. The information gained from this study should be a useful reference for implementing long-term prevention and control strategies for O. viverrini in Thailand. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Aim: Biogeographers have long known that plant species do not fully encompass their fundamental niche. Nonetheless, in practice, species distribution modelling assumes that plant distributions represent a reasonable approximation of their environmental tolerance. For ecological forecasting, projections of habitat loss due to climate change assume that many species will be unable to tolerate climate conditions outside of those found within their current distributional ranges. We aim to test how well occurrences in the native range approximate the climatic conditions in which plant species can survive. Location: Continental USA. Methods: We compared the climatic conditions between occurrences in the US native versus US non-native ranges using 144 non-invasive plant species. We quantified differences in January minimum temperature, July maximum temperature and annual precipitation as indicators of climatic tolerance. We also compared modelled potential distributions throughout the US based on native and total ranges to test how expanded climatic tolerance translates into predicted geographical range. Results: Most species (86{\%}) had non-native occurrences in climates outside those described by their native distributions. For the 80 species with lower minimum temperatures at non-native occurrences, the median expansion of minimum temperature tolerance was -2.9 °C. Similarly, for the 90 species with lower precipitation at non-native occurrences, the median expansion of minimum annual precipitation was -23 cm. Broader climatic conditions at non-native occurrences expanded the modelled potential geographical range by a median of 35{\%}, with smaller range species showing larger expansions of potential geographical range. Main conclusions: Our results show that plants' native ranges strongly underestimate climatic tolerance, leading species distribution models to underpredict potential range. The climatic tolerance of species with narrow native ranges appears most prone to underestimation. These findings suggest that many plants will be able to persist in situ with climate change for far longer than projected by species distribution models. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Throughout their range, marine mammals are vulnerable to incidental capture in fishing gear. Bycatch is a particularly important issue for cetaceans, which generally have lower potential rates of population growth and are thus more susceptible to the effects of bycatch mortality than other marine mammals. Spatial and temporal gaps in our knowledge of cetacean distributions can make it difficult to mitigate and manage bycatch. Here, we modelled the spatial and temporal distribution of two species of cetacean for which bycatch is known to occur; the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) and the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) and the spatial and temporal distribution of six different gear types. The models were integrated into a Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) to calculate risk in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Models showed temporal variation in spatial distribution for both species but particularly for harbour porpoise, whilst common dolphins were distributed in association with areas of high primary productivity where pelagic fish are likely to shoal. The risk assessment indicated two areas in the study region where risk from bycatch is likely to be particularly high, with gillnets being assessed as the highest risk gear type. Results should be used to guide fisheries and bycatch management through an integrated ecosystem approach, and could be used as a guide to where further observer effort should be focused. Results also provide valuable information for the designation of Marine Protected Areas for marine mammals. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Aim: Spatially-explicit trends in species richness and endemism on sandy shores are quantified to assess representation of beach ecosystems in existing reserve networks. Also, the relative importance of different drivers of species distributions are compared through species distribution modelling. Location: The South African beaches are among the best-studied in the world, providing sufficient biological data for the analyses. There is also a well-established coastal protected-area network that putatively provides moderate protection to nearly all beach habitats. Methods: Species distribution maps of beach-dependent vertebrates, macrofauna, microflora, and foredune vegetation were compiled from existing sources or modelled using standard techniques. While some data were available for the latter analyses, additional sampling was required to improve bioregional coverage. Each species' distribution was coded to a detailed map of the South African shoreline. Representation of habitats and species in various configurations of existing reserves was determined. Results: Overall, 535 species have been recorded on the South African sandy shores, including 139 common species. Endemism is variable among taxonomic groups. Notably, two-thirds of the macrofauna are regional endemics, half of which are endemic to South Africa. For almost all of the common species, {\textless} 20 {\%} of their distributions are protected in land-sea reserves. Protection of beach habitats is similarly poor ; conservation targets were not met in all cases, and most habitat types are considered Poorly Protected. Main conclusions: Sandy beach communities are considerably more diverse than they are generally acknowledged to be, and comprise a unique suite of biota. Given the species' narrow distributions and high degree of exposure to threats, many probably qualify as threatened/endangered. In spite of this, beaches are poorly represented in coastal reserve networks. To redress this issue, conservation planners need to account for beaches specifically, and to ensure they are represented in contiguous land-sea protected areas. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Non-native species can have severe impacts on ecosystems. Therefore, predictions of potentially suitable areas that are at risk of the establishment of non-native populations are desirable. In recent years, species distribution models (SDMs) have been widely applied for this purpose. However, the appropriate selection of species records, whether from the native area alone or also from the introduced range, is still a matter of debate. We combined analyses of native and non-native realized climate niches to understand differences between models based on all locations, as well as on locations from the native range only. Our approach was applied to four estrildid finch species that have been introduced to many regions around the world. Our results showed that SDMs based on location data from native areas alone may underestimate the potential distribution of a given species. The climatic niches of species in their native ranges differed from those of their non-native ranges. Niche comparisons resulted in low overlap values, indicating considerable niche shifts, at least in the realized niches of these species. All four species have high potential to spread over many tropical and subtropical areas. However, transferring these results to temperate areas has a high degree of uncertainty, and we urge caution when assessing the potential spread of tropical species that have been introduced to higher latitudes. {\textcopyright} 2014 British Ornithologists' Union.},

abstract = {The availability of a wide range of satellite measurements of environmental variables at different spatial and temporal resolutions, together with an increasing number of digitized and georeferenced species occurrences, has created the opportunity to model and monitor species geographic distribution and richness at regional to continental scales. In this paper, we examine the application of recently developed global data products from satellite observations in modeling the potential distribution of tree species and diversity in the Amazon basin. We use data from satellite sensors, including MODIS, QSCAT, SRTM, and TRMM, to develop different environmental variables related to vegetation, landscape, and climate. These variables are used in a maximum entropy method (Maxent) to model the geographical distribution of five commercial trees and to classify the patterns of tree alpha-diversity in the Amazon basin. Maxent simulations are analyzed using binomial tests of omission rates and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves to examine the model performance, the accuracy of geographic distributions, and the significance of environmental variables for discriminating suitable habitats. To evaluate the importance of satellite data, we used the Maxent jackknife test to quantify the training gains from data layers and to compare the results with model simulations using climate-only data. For all species and tree alpha-diversity, modeled distributions are in agreement with historical data and field observations. The results compare with climate-derived patterns, but provide better spatial resolution and detailed information on the habitat characteristics. Among satellite data products, QSCAT backscatter, representing canopy moisture and roughness, and MODIS leaf area index (LAI) are the most important variables in almost all cases. Model simulations suggest that climate and remote sensing results are complementary and that the best distribution patterns can be achieved when the two data sets are combined. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Location North and Central America, northern South America and the Caribbean. Methods Using positive occurrence data within the native range of both orchid bee species, Maxent species distribution modelling was employed to evaluate the probability of suitable habitats in the USA. The power of predictability for the model was tested using partitions of the data. Results Our results show the absence of suitable habitat in southern Arizona for E. polychroma to maintain populations there, as well as establishing the northernmost limit for the species at around 29°N in north-western Mexico. Suitable habitat was found for E. viridissima in various locations throughout southern Florida. This species is predicted to spread to occupy roughly the southern half of the Florida Peninsula. Main conclusions The findings indicate that species distribution modelling is useful for evaluating records of species occurrence outside of their native range. Our results indicate that the isolated record of a male of E. polychroma from southern Arizona should not be considered representative of an established population in the absence of further males and females from the same region. Conversely, E. viridissima has successfully become established in south-eastern Florida after a seemingly accidental introduction first noticed in the summer of 2003. We discuss the naturalization of E. viridissima in Florida, the probability of suitable habitat across the Caribbean (where orchid bees are otherwise natively absent today) and the absence of perfume orchids (Orchidaceae).

abstract = {Aim: A fundamental problem in evolutionary biology has been understanding the role of environmental factors in the process of genetic diversification. Our main goal was to define the ecological niches of two Boa imperator lineages, in order to assess if environmental drivers could be associated with the divergence and genetic variation between them. We quantified the environmental niches at two evolutionary and geographical scales: regional-historical (lineages) and local-ecological (individuals within lineages). Location: Neotropical region of Mexico and mainland Central America. Methods: We performed ecological niche modelling (ENM) methods by defining the accessibility area per B. imperator lineage, based on their geographic ranges, to analyse ecological and geographical distributions. We applied statistics of niche overlap, interpredictability, equivalency and similarity. We tested the niche-centrality hypothesis within lineages by evaluating the relationship between genetic metrics and the distance to ecological and geographical centroids. Results: Temperature seasonality, precipitation and elevation were the most informative environmental variables (GARP and MaxEnt). Ecological interprediction and niche similarity and equivalency tests revealed a dynamic process of niche evolution, where the niches of the two lineages are not identical but still showed a signature of niche conservatism. Correlation analyses between genetic variability and structure showed negative correlations with distance to ecological and geographical centroids at the local level. Main conclusions: Our results support the role of environmental variables as significant and highly accurate predictors of lineage distribution and divergence, in agreement with the boa's evolutionary history. The niches of the two lineages are not identical, sharing environmental niche space but not all ecological variables. A historically more recent signal of genetic structure within lineages was evident, where the quality of the ecological niche further influences genetic distribution patterns within populations. Our results illustrate how ENM may validate evolutionary patterns from a biogeographical and phylogeographical framework. {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

In this study, we demonstrate the use of information criterion approaches to setting regularization in Maxent, and we compare models selected using information criteria to models selected using other criteria that are common in the literature. We evaluate model performance using occurrence data generated from a known ''true'' initial Maxent model, using several different metrics for model quality and transferability. We demonstrate that models that are inappropriately complex or inappropriately simple show reduced ability to infer habitat quality, reduced ability to infer the relative importance of variables in constraining species' distributions, and reduced transferability to other time periods. We also demonstrate that information criteria may offer significant advantages over the methods commonly used in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {The inositol-phosphate messenger inositol(1,3,4,5)tetrakisphosphate (IP4) is essential for thymocyte positive selection by regulating plasma-membrane association of the protein tyrosine kinase Itk downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR). IP4 can act as a soluble analog of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) membrane lipid product phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 recruits signaling proteins such as Itk to cellular membranes by binding to PH and other domains. In thymocytes, low-dose IP4 binding to the Itk PH domain surprisingly promoted and high-dose IP4 inhibited PIP3 binding of Itk PH domains. However, the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of membrane recruitment of Itk by IP4 and PIP3 remain unclear. The distinct Itk PH domain ability to oligomerize is consistent with a cooperative-allosteric mode of IP4 action. However, other possibilities cannot be ruled out due to difficulties in quantitatively measuring the interactions between Itk, IP4 and PIP3, and in generating non-oligomerizing Itk PH domain mutants. This has hindered a full mechanistic understanding of how IP4 controls Itk function. By combining experimentally measured kinetics of PLC$\gamma$1 phosphorylation by Itk with in silico modeling of multiple Itk signaling circuits and a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) based computational approach, we show that those in silico models which are most robust against variations of protein and lipid expression levels and kinetic rates at the single cell level share a cooperative-allosteric mode of Itk regulation by IP4 involving oligomeric Itk PH domains at the plasma membrane.

abstract = {Aim To identify the bioclimatic niche of the endangered Andean cat (Leopardus jacobita), one of the rarest and least known felids in the world, by developing a species distribution model. Location South America, High Andes and Patagonian steppe. Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina. Methods We used 108 Andean cat records to build the models, and 27 to test them, applying the Maxent algorithm to sets of uncorrelated bioclimatic variables from global databases, including elevation. We based our biogeographical interpretations on the examination of the predicted geographic range, the modelled response curves and latitudinal variations in climatic variables associated with the locality data. Results Simple bioclimatic models for Andean cats were highly predictive with only 3-4 explanatory variables. The climatic niche of the species was defined by extreme diurnal variations in temperature, cold minimum and moderate maximum temperatures, and aridity, characteristic not only of the Andean highlands but also of the Patagonian steppe. Argentina had the highest representation of suitable climates, and Chile the lowest. The most favourable conditions were centrally located and spanned across international boundaries. Discontinuities in suitable climatic conditions coincided with three biogeographical barriers associated with climatic or topographic transitions. Main conclusions Simple bioclimatic models can produce useful predictions of suitable climatic conditions for rare species, including major biogeographical constraints. In our study case, these constraints are also known to affect the distribution of other Andean species and the genetic structure of Andean cat populations. We recommend surveys of areas with suitable climates and no Andean cat records, including the corridor connecting two core populations. The inclusion of landscape variables at finer scales, crucially the distribution of Andean cat prey, would contribute to refine our predictions for conservation applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The aims of the current study are to assess GIS-based landslide spatial modeling using four models, namely data-driven evidential belief function (EBF), frequency ratio (FR), maximum entropy (Maxent), and logistic regression (LR), and to compare their performances. At first, a landslide inventory map was prepared according to aerial photographs, satellite images, and extensive field surveys. In total, 3971 landslide events were recognized in the study area that used 2979 landslides (75 {\%}) for modeling and 992 landslide events (25 {\%}) for validation. In the next step, the landslide-conditioning factors, namely slope angle, slope aspect, altitude, plan curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), slope-length (LS), lithology, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance from rivers, distance from faults, distance from roads, and rainfall, were derived from the spatial database. Finally, landslide susceptibility maps of Ganzhou City were mapped in ArcGIS based on EBF, FR, Maxent, and LR approaches and were validated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC plot assessment results showed that in the landslide susceptibility maps using the EBF, FR, Maxent, and LR models, the area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.7367, 0.7789, 0.7903, and 0.8237, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that all four models have AUC values of more than 0.70 and can be used in landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area. Also, the LR model had the best performance in the current study. Meanwhile, the mentioned models (EBF, FR, Maxent, and LR) showed almost similar results. The resultant susceptibility maps produced in the current study can be useful for land use planning and hazard mitigation purposes in the study area. {\textcopyright} 2016, Saudi Society for Geosciences.},

abstract = {Predicting climatic niche of species and projecting their potential range shifts in geographic distribution under future climate scenarios is essential for assessing impacts of climate change. Ecological niche-based models are widely used to map habitat suitability of current and future potential distribution of species, using precise coordinates of species occurrences, along with climatic and various environmental variables. Despite the importance of high dependence on forest resources in the Himalayan region, the direct impacts of climate change on major forest tree species is not well-documented. In the present study, we used MaxEnt (or maximum entropy) modelling to predict current distribution and changes in the future distributions of four ecologically and economically dominant forest tree species (Quercus leucotrichophora, Q. semecarpifolia, Q. floribunda, and Pinus roxburghii) in the central Himalayan region. Future predictions were based on representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for two time periods (2050s and 2070s). We demonstrated the use of MaxEnt by combining different climatic, geomorphologic, and pedologic variables as predictor variables to model the potential climatic niches. We evaluated the model performance with an average AUC value varying as 0.809 (±0.020), 0.982 (±0.008), 0.966 (±0.006), and 0.803 (±0.025) for Q. leucotrichophora, Q. semecarpifolia, Q. floribunda and P. roxburghii, respectively. Depending upon the RCPs, the results show both increase and decrease in suitable habitat range of these species across all future climate scenarios. The shifts in geographic distributions of climatic niches show unusual patterns, implying the need for urgent adaptive forest management strategies. Our approach can be used as a baseline database for broad-scale applicability in forest tree species restoration and conservation planning. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A key challenge for models of community ecology is to combine deterministic mechanism and stochastic drift in a systematic, transparent and tractable manner. Another challenge is to explain and unify different ecological patterns, hitherto modelled in isolation, within a single modelling framework. Here, we show that statistical mechanics provides an effective way to meet both challenges. We apply the statistical principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) to a simple resource-based, non-neutral model of a plant community. In contrast to previous ecological applications of MaxEnt, our use of MaxEnt emphasises its theoretical basis in the combinatorics of sampling frequencies, an approach that clarifies its ecological interpretation. In this approach, mechanism and drift are identified, respectively, with ecological resource constraints and entropy maximization. We obtain realistic predictions for species abundance distributions as well as contrasting stability-diversity relationships at community and population levels. The model also predicts critical behaviour that may provide a basis for understanding desertification and other ecological tipping points. Our results complement and extend previous ecological applications of MaxEnt to new areas of community ecology, and further illustrate MaxEnt as a powerful yet simple modelling tool for combining mechanism and drift in a way that unifies disparate ecological patterns. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

We studied the habitat preference of the Scops Owl by assessing the habitat occupancy of 401 territories distributed in a large area in northwest Italy, with a special focus on 98 territories located in a high-density area (Monferrato). Habitat characteristics were analyzed with maximum entropy (MAXENT) models that included both vegetational (16 land use categories) and physical features estimated from a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) (altitude, slope, hillshade). In the Monferrato area, a comparison of 2009 landcover was also made with year 1954/55 characteristics obtained from aerial photographs. In the full northwest Italy area, the Scops Owl preferred areas located at middle altitude with intermediate slope. The preferred habitats included riparian areas and pasture-grassland, while woodlands and zones with Robinia pseudoacacia shrublands were avoided. In the Monferrato area, Scops Owl occupancy occurred in sites where the landuse (croplands/vineyard mosaic) had changed little since the mid-1950s. Our study suggests that conservation activity should focus on interventions halting riparian zone transformation and subsidies promoting agricultural practices favouring pastures and grassland. {\textcopyright} 2013 Unione Zoologica Italiana.},

abstract = {The local and regional distribution of seabed terrain types depends on factors such as slope and terrain ruggedness. Digital bathymetrical models (DBM) are therefore essential for mapping and predictive modeling of marine habitats. DBMs vary considerably with respect to scale and quality, and this variation is likely to influence the predictive ability of marine habitat models built with use of DBM-derived environmental predictor variables. We studied the interpretability of seabed terrain types from four different DBMs in two ways: by visual inspection of hillshade representation of the DBMs and by subjecting sets of variables derived from each of the four DBMs to maximum entropy (MaxEnt) predictive modeling of six seabed terrain types. Our results show that DBMs based on multibeam echo sounder data, resampled at resolutions up to 50 m, enable identification of concentrations of seabed terrain types characterized by moraine-ridge assemblies and plough-mark fields. Variables derived from models interpolated from contours of existing marine maps and bathymetric databases have strong limitations and merely enable separation of terrain dominated by rugged bedrock seabed from soft sediment flats. Interpolated DBMs are currently the only type of bathymetrical data that cover all Norwegian coastal waters. Their poor quality is an important obstacle to predictive modeling and classification of seabed habitats. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Aim: The knowledge of both potential distribution and habitat suitability is fundamental for conservation planning and management of a variety of taxa world-wide. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly applied as predictive tools for these purposes. Such models are based on the concept of ecological niche and assume that species distribute themselves based on niche spaces defined by climate and habitat features. However, this assumption can be violated due to the existence of pure spatial range constraints, a factor rarely accounted for in SDMs, particularly for highly mobile species. We analyse whether pure distance effects, niche-based environmental responses or a combination of both factors can play an important role in limiting the large-scale distribution of highly mobile species. Location: Spain, southern Europe. Methods: We modelled the spatial distribution of an expanding raptor species, the marsh harrier Circus aeruginosus, in Spain. We implemented one conventional statistical method (generalized linear model) and one nonparametric technique (maximum entropy, Maxent) using a large dataset on marsh harrier occurrence (n = 1586) in two different periods of the annual cycle, that is breeding and wintering seasons. We developed models that included environmental variables and that either ignored or incorporated spatial constraints using spatial eigenvector mapping (spatial filters). Results: By comparing model accuracy, we found evidence that the distribution of marsh harriers in Spain was spatially constrained beyond environmental variables and that the effect of spatial constraints varies depending on the period of their annual cycle. Main conclusions: Contrary to the equilibrium postulate, our results support the prediction that environmental specializations do not necessarily result in complete habitat matching due to dispersal limitations. Thus, ignoring spatial constraints in SDMs can lead to misunderstandings of the ecological mechanisms that explain species range limits. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

Here we estimated a SDM based on actual distribution information, in relation to climatic, hydrological, human population, and vegetation data sets, to understand the ecological requirements and geographic distribution of the Neotropical otter Lontra longicaudis, a species whose habitat requirements and conservation needs are mostly unknown. Using MaxEnt, we defined its potential distribution and most suitable areas to indicate priority areas for research and to analyze the efficiency of Protected Areas (PAs). Our findings suggest that the range of Neotropical otters could extend beyond their present estimated distribution, adding new areas in northeastern Brazil, Andean region, west Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Mexico, and Argentina, with higher suitability in rain forests (especially Atlantic and Amazon Forests). We also found that PAs are the most suitable areas for otter distribution. Although better than non-protected areas, PAs are close to the median of the suitability values, indicating that they still can be improved to conserve otters. Annual temperature and human population density explained most data variance in our model. We suggest the change of the actual status of Neotropical otter to Least Concern or Near Threatened categories. We recommend verifying the possible sympatry with other otters, and demonstrate that rudimentary and/or occasional recent data of occurrence can also be used in SDMs and contribute to species conservation. {\textcopyright} Marcelo Lopes Rheingantz, Jorge Fernando Saraiva de Menezes and Benoit de Thoisy.},

Location: Lerista occurs across the entire Australian mainland, with diversity concentrated in arid and semi-arid regions. Methods: Geographical range size was estimated directly from c. 14,000 museum specimens using bioclimatic modelling in MaxEnt. Body form was quantified using principal components analysis of morphometric variables. Comparative analyses testing for a correlation between these two variables used a full Bayesian approach that accounts for uncertainties in trait optimization as well as in tree topology and branch lengths. Results: A serpentine body form (elongated with reduced limbs) was significantly associated with smaller geographical range size, in both phylogenetically corrected and uncorrected analyses - but only if species from single localities (whose ranges could not be modelled using the above methods) were excluded. Main conclusions: These results suggest a general predictive relationship between body form and geographical range size in lizards: elongate, limb-reduced lizards tend to exhibit more restricted geographical ranges that may reflect reduced dispersal ability and may also predispose them to greater vulnerability of extinction. {\textcopyright} 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Habitat evaluation has an important significance for management of wildlife populations and conservation planning. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and abundant landscape-level data provide new opportunities for biologists to evaluate wildlife habitat quality. Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) is a recently introduced modeling technique, achieving high predictive accuracy and enjoying several additional attractive properties. With the purpose of predicting habitat for blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) in the Helan Mountain Range, we collected the occurrence records for this species and the environmental factors, the occurrence records were collected from the study area from 2010 to 2011, and the date of environmental factors were extracted from the Thematic Mapper (TM) image of Helan Mountain in 2007. The method relies on the combined use of GIS and Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) model in this research. GIS was used to produce the data needed in the model, MAXENT can model species geographic distributions with presence-only data, and is suitable for the research because absence data are not available for blue sheep. A map indicated the distribution of habitat suitability of blue sheep in Helan Mountain generated from the data and software. In this paper, the method of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the accuracy of MAXENT model, the area under ROC curve (AUC) of the model was 0. 915, indicating that the result of assessment was excellent, and the results showed the relationships between the distribution of blue sheep and the environmental factors, the result of Jackknife test indicated that the mining, slope, altitude and road were the main factors influencing habitat selection of blue sheep. Along with the increase of slope, distance from mine and road, the habitat suitability increased gradually, and habitat suitability decreased gradually with the increasing distance from water. Suitable habitat was mainly distributed in southwest of Ningxia Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve (east part) and lesser distributed in the Inner-Mongolia Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve (west part), with the total area of 1 006.9km2, accounting for 28{\%} of the total assessment area. Blue sheep preferred to use montane savanna dominated and the rugged slopes at elevations of 1 500-2 300 m. There were two factors interfered in achieving accurate results, one was difficult to reach occurrence points for the steep terrain, and the other was that we could not get the information of traffic flow on every road. During the research, we reduced the error by recording the nearest position to the target point and choosing the main road on the maps. The results showed that the most serious human interferences were mining and road, more regulatory actions are needed to be taken in those aspects to improve the habitat's quality as well as promote the progress of the population.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to characterize environmental differentiation of lineages within Rhabdomys and provide hypotheses regarding potential areas of contact between them in the Southern African subregion, including the Republic of South Africa, Lesotho, and Namibia. Records of Rhabdomys taxa across the study region were compiled and georeferenced from the literature, museum records, and field expeditions. Presence records were summarized within a 10 × 10 km grid covering the study area. Environmental information regarding climate, topography, land use, and vegetation productivity was gathered at the same resolution. Multivariate statisticswere used to characterize the current environmental niche and distribution of the whole genus as well as of three mitochondrial lineages known to occur in southern Africa. Distribution modeling was carried out usingMAXENT in order to generate hypotheses regarding current distribution of each taxa and their potential contact zones. Results indicate that the two species within Rhabdomys appear to have differentiated across the precipitation/temperature gradient present in the region from east to west. R. dilectus occupies the wettest areas in eastern southern Africa, while R. pumilio occupies the warmer and drier regions in the west, but also penetrates in the more mesic central part of the region. We provide further evidence of environmental differentiationwithin two lineages of R. dilectus. Contact zones between lineages appear to occur in areas of strong environmental gradients and topographic complexity, such as the transition zones between major biomes and the escarpment area where a sharp altitudinal gradient separates coastal and plateau areas, but alsowithin more homogeneous areas such aswithin grassland and savannah biomes. Our results indicate that Rhabdomys may bemore specialized than previously thought when considering current knowledge regarding mitochondrial lineages. The genus appears to have differentiated along two major environmental axes in the study region, but results also suggest dispersal limitations and biological interactions having a role in limiting current distribution boundaries. Furthermore, the projection of the potential geographic distribution of the different lineages suggests several contact zones that may be interesting study fields for understanding the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes during speciation. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.},

abstract = {The freshwater snail Pseudosuccinea columella was recorded for the first time in Argentina more than 60 years ago. Since then its distribution in the wild has been restricted to the northeastern provinces. Here we record the presence of P. columella in southern Pampas for the first time, extending its distribution more than 500 km southwards. The climatic suitability of this and other areas of South America for its establishment and spread was analysed using habitat modelling software. Hitherto its spread within and between watercourses in southern Pampas has been very limited, probably through a combination of low climatic suitability, recent introduction and low connectivity of the drainage basins. The suitability of other areas where it has been recently recorded indicates a moderate risk of further spread in central and northwestern Argentina and in coastal areas of the Pacific rim of South America (southern Per{\'{u}} and northern Chile). The recent spread of P. columella in the wild in Argentina may be the result of an increase in the trade in aquarium plants or of the evolution of a new lineage with different ecological capabilities. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Malacological Society of Australasia and the Society for the Study of Molluscan Diversity.},

abstract = {The whip-like gorgonian Viminella flagellum (Alcyonacea, Ellisellidae) has an Atlantic-Mediterranean distribution. In Italian seas, the species is a common component of deep-sea rocky environments from the north-western Mediterranean area to the Strait of Sicily. V. flagellum grows in deep habitats, sometimes outlining the environment with dense forests. This work describes its habitat in an area in the southeastern Sardinian waters (central-western Mediterranean Sea), where a dense forest of the species was found. The specimens were filmed and photographed between 120 and 260 m depth with a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). High-resolution multibeam echosounder (MBES) bathymetry data of the area were acquired and morphometric parameters were derived. These parameters were assumed to be relevant for the distribution of the whip-like gorgonians and were used in an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) to explore the niche and habitat preference of the target species. In order to identify which Eco-geographical variables are useful to predict coral distribution, we used the Maximum Entropy model (MaxEnt). Our results gave a first description of the habitat preference of V. flagellum. Specimens were found in a distinctive habitat, with respect to the overall features of the entire studied area which was characterised by a marked slope in a simple rocky seabed system, within a water depth range of 125–150 m. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Automatic detection of disfluencies in spoken language is important for making speech recognition output more readable, and for aiding downstream language processing modules. We compare a generative hidden Markov model (HMM)-based approach and two conditional models - a maximum entropy (Maxent) model and a conditional random field (CRF) - for detecting disfluencies in speech. The conditional modeling approaches provide a more principled way to model correlated features. In particular, the CRF approach directly detects the reparandum regions, and thus avoids the use of ad-hoc heuristic rules. We evaluate performance of these three models across two different corpora (conversational speech and broadcast news) and for two types of transcriptions (human transcriptions and recognition output). Overall we find that the conditional modeling approaches (Maxent and CRF) tend to outperform (with one exception) the HMM approach. Effects of speaking style, word recognition errors, and future directions are also discussed.},

abstract = {Non-native species can have severe impacts on ecosystems. Therefore, predictions of potentially suitable areas that are at risk of the establishment of non-native populations are desirable. In recent years, species distribution models (SDMs) have been widely applied for this purpose. However, the appropriate selection of species records, whether from the native area alone or also from the introduced range, is still a matter of debate. We combined analyses of native and non-native realized climate niches to understand differences between models based on all locations, as well as on locations from the native range only. Our approach was applied to four estrildid finch species that have been introduced to many regions around the world. Our results showed that SDMs based on location data from native areas alone may underestimate the potential distribution of a given species. The climatic niches of species in their native ranges differed from those of their non-native ranges. Niche comparisons resulted in low overlap values, indicating considerable niche shifts, at least in the realized niches of these species. All four species have high potential to spread over many tropical and subtropical areas. However, transferring these results to temperate areas has a high degree of uncertainty, and we urge caution when assessing the potential spread of tropical species that have been introduced to higher latitudes. {\textcopyright} 2014 British Ornithologists' Union.},

abstract = {In 2012, Moulds established the morphologically similar cicada genera Simona and Chelapsalta, each with one Australian species (sancta Distant and puer Walker, respectively). In this paper, two new species are described within the genus Si-mona Moulds 2012, S. erema sp. nov. and S. retracta sp. nov., and one within the genus Chelapsalta Moulds 2012, C. myoporae sp. nov. The type species of Simona (female holotype), S. sancta (Distant, 1913), is redescribed based on a con-temporary male, nominated a plesiotype, held in the Australian National Insect Collection. Melampsalta subgulosa Ash-ton 1914 is supported as a junior synonym of S. sancta. The species within the two genera of Simona and Chelapsalta are morphologically very similar. S. erema occurs widely through the arid regions of inland Australia, extending west from western Queensland through the Northern Territory, to central-western Western Australia, a linear distance of approxi-mately 2200 km. S. retracta is known from a single semi-arid locality in southern inland Queensland. C. myoporae occurs widely through southeast, central and southwest Queensland, extending southwards into inland and western N.S.W. and southeastern South Australia. It tends to occur most commonly within vegetation associated with seasonal riverine flood-plains, and in some areas of poorly drained and clay-rich soils. The calling songs of these three species, together with those of S. sancta and C. puer, are described. Detailed comparisons made of the songs of S. erema and C. myoporae, each from three widely separated locations, clearly exhibit structural consistency in their calling songs across their distributions. The Simona songs are complex and contain multiple elements; the species are very mobile and wary, and inhabit low dense shrubland. The songs of the two Chelapsalta species, both relatively sedentary in behaviour, in contrast consist of rela-tively uniform chirping and buzzing elements. It is suggested that, although the two genera are morphologically similar, the calling songs, behaviour and habitats do distinguish them, at least as represented by these species documented. MaxEnt modeling of the species climatic envelope for the widely distributed species Simona erema suggests an association with summer-peak rainfall and diurnal temperature range. Modeling under estimated conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (22 ky) suggests the possibility of an even more widespread distribution at that time. {\textcopyright} 2015 Magnolia Press.},

Our research was based on 283 specimens of all known species of assassin bugs belonging to the subfamily Diaspidiinae stored in European museum collections and a set of 21 environmental variables in the form of a 1×1km grid covering Africa and Madagascar. Based on occurrence localities, as well as a digital elevation model and layer of the tree cover-continuous fields, information about the distribution of each species is given. Using Maxent software, potentially useful ecological niches were modeled, which allowed for the creation of a map of the potential distribution of the members of this subfamily and for determining their climatic preferences. A jackknife test showed that annual precipitation, annual temperature range and tree cover-continuous fields were the most important environmental variables affecting the distribution of the subfamily Diaspidiinae. An analysis of climatic preferences suggested that the representatives of the subfamily were linked mainly to the tropical climate. An analysis of environmental variables also showed that the subfamily preferred areas with herbaceous vegetation and some trees, and this preference is probably caused by the food preferences of their prey. On the basis of the museum data on the species occurrence, as well as ecological niche modeling methods, we provided new and valuable information on potentially suitable habitat and the possible range of distribution of the subfamily Diaspidiinae along with its climatic preferences. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Entomological Society of Japan.},

In the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, it is captured principally in commercial longline fisheries, and in small artisanal fisheries, however, it is also taken throughout its range in this region as an incidental catch of the tuna purse-seine fishery. Previous studies suggest that overexploitation and climate change may reduce abundance and cause changes in spatial distributions of marine species. The main objective of this study was to describe the habitat preferences of striped marlin and the changes in its distribution in response to environmental factors. Habitat modeling was conducted using a maximum entropy model. Operational level data for 2003-2014, collected by scientific observers aboard large purse seine vessels, were compiled by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and were matched with detailed (4 km) oceanographic data from satellites and general circulation models. Results showed that the spatial distribution of habitat was dynamic, with seasonal shifts between coastal (winter) and oceanic (summer) waters. We found that the preferred habitat is mainly in coastal waters with warm sea surface temperatures and a high chlorophyll-a concentration. {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Provision of suitable habitat for waterbirds is a major challenge for environmental managers in arid and semiarid regions with high spatial and temporal variability in rainfall. It is understood in broad terms that to survive waterbirds must move according to phases of wet–dry cycles, with coastal habitats providing drought refugia and inland wetlands used during the wet phase. However, both inland and coastal wetlands are subject to major anthropogenic pressures, and the various species of waterbird may have particular habitat requirements and respond individualistically to spatiotemporal variations in resource distribution. A better understanding of the relationships between occurrence of waterbirds and habitat condition under changing climatic conditions and anthropogenic pressures will help clarify patterns of habitat use and the targeting of investments in conservation. We provide the first predictive models of habitat availability between wet and dry phases for six widely distributed waterbird species at a large spatial scale. We first test the broad hypothesis that waterbirds are largely confined to coastal regions during a dry phase. We then examine the contrasting results among the six species, which support other hypotheses erected on the basis of their ecological characteristics. There were large increases in area of suitable habitat in inland regions in the wet year compared with the dry year for all species, ranging from 4.14{\%} for Australian White Ibis to 31.73{\%} for Eurasian Coot. With over half of the suitable habitat for three of the six species was located in coastal zones during drought, our study highlights the need to identify and conserve coastal drought refuges. Monitoring of changes in extent and condition of wetlands, combined with distribution modeling of waterbirds, will help support improvements in the conservation and management of waterbirds into the future. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

Maxent was used to calculate habitat suitability and to identify environmental variables underlying the differences in observed distribution patterns. A sub-sampling procedure was employed to test model stability. Models were evaluated by calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC). The analyses show that except for the costal dune area, the western part of the Netherlands is unsuitable for the species. Suitability predictions for C. panzeri, E. lapponicus and E. sylvestris are very similar, with suitable areas concentrated in the eastern and the north-eastern parts of the country and along the western coast. The prediction model for E. pallidus is somewhat more restricted, especially in the northern part of the country. Soil type, land cover and altitudinal range are most important in predicting the distribution of all species. A correspondence analysis was performed to identify the association between the species distribution and the most influential environmental variables. Correspondence analysis indicated that the species distributions are comparably associated with soil type and land cover while species appear to have different preferences with respect to altitudinal range.},

Maxent modelling and GIS environmental envelope analysis of the biogenic bed forming species, Modiolus modiolus was carried out. The Maxent model was tested and validated using 75{\%}/25{\%} training/test occurrence records and validated against two sampling biases (the whole study area and a 20km buffer). The model was compared to the envelope analysis and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Area Under the curve; AUC) was evaluated. The performance of the Maxent model was rated as 'good' to 'excellent' on all replicated runs and low variation in the runs was recorded from the AUC values. The extent of "most suitable", "less suitable" and "unsuitable" habitat was calculated for the baseline year (2009) and the projected increased ocean temperature scenarios (2030, 2050, 2080 and 2100). A loss of 100{\%} of "most suitable" habitat was reported by 2080. Maintaining a suitable level of protection of marine habitats/species of conservation importance may require management of the decline and migration rather than maintenance of present extent.

We provide broad conditions under which the two aforementioned estimation paradigms produce the same signal estimate. We also show how the maxent formalism can be used to provide solutions to three important problems: How to select sizes of constraint sets in ST estimation (the analysis highlights the role of shrinkage); how to choose the values of parameters in regularized restoration when using multiple regularization functionals; and how to trade off model complexity and goodness of fit in a model selection problem.},

abstract = {Aim: To test the Eltonian noise hypothesis (ENH), that biotic interactions do not affect species distributions at large geographical scales. Location: The Brazilian cerrado, a central South American savanna and biodiversity hotspot. Methods: We modelled the distributions of 11 species of cerrado parrots using the software Maxent at four different spatial resolutions. We built models using abiotic variables, biotic variables (distribution of diet resources) and models combining abiotic and biotic variables. We compared model performance using the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), retrieved from test data. We partitioned the variance between sets of predictors using a generalized linear model (GLM). Finally, we evaluated whether improvement in model performance (higher AUC values) in models with both abiotic and biotic variables, was related to the species' dietary niche breadth and/or spatial resolution of the models. Results: We found that model performance was improved in most cases by the addition of biotic variables. Our variance-partitioning approach revealed that abiotic and biotic variables contribute independently to the final model. We found no relationship between model improvement and spatial resolution. We also found no relationship between dietary niche breadth and model improvement, indicating that dietary generalist and specialist species were not differently affected by the inclusion of biotic variables in the models. Main conclusions: Our results did not support the ENH. In this study, we explicitly incorporated a biotic variable (diet resource distribution) into species distribution models (SDMs), and we showed that these variables generally improve models and have independent contributions. These results agree with previous studies that incorporated biotic variables into SDMs. Ultimately, our results indicate that SDMs performed with abiotic variables only may depict only a partial representation of the geographical distribution of a species. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Species distribution models were developed to predict the spatial patterns of the species diversity and the genetic diversity of stream organisms using a distributed hydrological model. We derived annual metrics of water depth and flow velocity in rivers using a hydrological model covering an entire catchment in northeastern Japan. We acquired geospatial data throughout the catchment and the presence records of six taxa within the part of the catchment. Subsequently we derived habitat suitability indices (HSIs) for these taxa using a frequency analysis or the maximum-entropy approach (MaxEnt) to predict three metrics of species diversity. The Shannon-Wiener's diversity index based on MaxEnt (Shannon{\_}MaxE) most effectively represented empirical taxon richness. Subsequently, by comparing Shannon{\_}MaxE and empirical genetic diversity for the four species of stream insects, we evaluated species-genetic diversity correlations (SGDCs). Of the four species, only one caddisfly species (Hydropsyche orientalis) displayed significant positive SGDCs. The result reflects the broad habitat range of this taxon throughout the catchment and its poor dispersal ability, whereas the other three species lacked SGDCs and displayed either a strong dispersal potential (Stenopsyche marmorata and Ephemera japonica) or a narrower habitat range within upstream domains (Hydropsyche albicephala). Finally, we estimated the spatial distribution of genetic diversity of H. orientalis populations based on the calculated Shannon{\_}MaxE using the positive SGDC. This framework is promising for projecting future biodiversity in the context of anthropogenic perturbations such as climate change. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors Ecohydrology Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

In addition, ecological niche models (ENMs, employing MaxEnt) were used to investigate the ability of the native and invaded ranges to describe the species' distribution elsewhere. Results: We found the zebra mussel to occupy different, but partly overlapping, environmental niches in the native Ponto-Caspian region and invaded European and North American regions. Accordingly, the ENMs calibrated with the native range accurately predicted regions of early colonization in Europe and North America, but not the subsequent expansion. ENMs calibrated with data from the European range failed to describe the invaded range in North America, and vice versa. Climate suitability curves further confirmed a progressive spatio-temporal stretching of the climatic tolerance of the zebra mussel. Main conclusions: This study provides novel evidence of multiple episodes of niche expansion in a notorious invasive species, and supports the use of partial ranges to better understand the species' spatio-temporal history of invasion. Separately, the native and invaded ranges provided important information regarding the species' environmental tolerance and the regions that are most suitable for first colonization, as well as identifying regions at risk in the case of a possible reintroduction. Collectively, the differences between the three ecological niche projections of the zebra mussel demonstrate that niche expansion of an invasive species within a new geographical region promotes the organism's further invasion in space and time, a process known as invasion ratcheting. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {The study analyzed the potential of multi-temporal satellite remote sensing data (Terra-MODIS) for phenological studies in Mexico. Within two conceptually and methodologically independent approaches, we analyzed vegetation index data to continuously predict species' occurrence and linked these predictions to a satellite data based land cover map of Mexico. Phenological metrics derived from interpolated MODIS EVI time series together with topographic data of the SRTM mission and bioclimatic variables (WorldClim) were used as environmental predictors for Maxent distribution modeling of six Quercus species. We evaluated model performance based on 20 {\%} independent occurrence data using model sensitivity, model specificity, and AUC statistics. Forest classes were extracted from a recently accomplished national land cover map of Mexico (NALCMS) with approximate accuracy of 82 {\%}. We found a remarkable spatial agreement of modeled Quercus distribution and forest classes. The value-added combination of both approaches allows for improved vegetation maps and the methodology has a great potential of transferability. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Planning for resilience is the focus of many marine conservation programs and initiatives. These efforts aim to inform conservation strategies for marine regions to ensure they have inbuilt capacity to retain biological diversity and ecological function in the face of global environmental change - particularly changes in climate and resource exploitation. In the absence of direct biological and ecological information for many marine species, scientists are increasingly using spatially-explicit, predictive-modeling approaches. Through the improved access to multibeam sonar and underwater video technology these models provide spatial predictions of the most suitable regions for an organism at resolutions previously not possible. However, sensible-looking, well-performing models can provide very different predictions of distribution depending on which occurrence dataset is used. To examine this, we construct species distribution models for nine temperate marine sedentary fishes for a 25.7 km 2 study region off the coast of southeastern Australia. We use generalized linear model (GLM), generalized additive model (GAM) and maximum entropy (MAXENT) to build models based on co-located occurrence datasets derived from two underwater video methods (i.e. baited and towed video) and fine-scale multibeam sonar based seafloor habitat variables. Overall, this study found that the choice of modeling approach did not considerably influence the prediction of distributions based on the same occurrence dataset. However, greater dissimilarity between model predictions was observed across the nine fish taxa when the two occurrence datasets were compared (relative to models based on the same dataset). Based on these results it is difficult to draw any general trends in regards to which video method provides more reliable occurrence datasets. Nonetheless, we suggest predictions reflecting the species apparent distribution (i.e. a combination of species distribution and the probability of detecting it). Consequently, we also encourage researchers and marine managers to carefully interpret model predictions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Monk et al.},

abstract = {Species distribution modelling is increasingly used in ecological studies and is particularly useful in conservation planning. Models are, however, typically created with a coarse resolution, although conservation planning often requires a high resolution. In this study we created high resolution models and explored central aspects of the modelling procedure; transferability and predictive performance of the models. We created models for two breeding water bird species, common eider Somateria mollissima and herring gull Larus argentatus, based on data from two regions in the Finnish archipelago (234 islands). We used seven variables which we considered as potential predictors of nest site location: distance to forest, distance to rock and distance to low vegetation, exposure, elevation, slope and curvature of the land surface. We tested the predictive ability of the models crosswise between the areas by using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The models were transferable between our study areas and the predictive performance varied from fair to excellent. The most important predictors overall were exposure and distance to forest. More general models, with higher regularization values in the Maxent software, had better transferability regarding predictive performance. However, when we fitted a model based on 60{\%} of the data from both regions and evaluated the model on the remaining 40{\%}, the most complex model had the highest accuracy. Extrapolation of SDMs, evaluated on data from the same region, should therefore always be done with caution as the most accurate model might not have the best transferability if it is not general enough. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Aim: To determine whether the method used to build distributional maps from raw data influences the representation of two principal macroecological patterns: the latitudinal gradient in species richness and the latitudinal variation in range sizes (Rapoport's rule). Location: World-wide. Methods: All available distribution data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) for those fish species that are members of orders of fishes with only marine representatives in each order were extracted and cleaned so as to compare four different procedures: point-to-grid (GBIF maps), range maps applying an $\alpha$-shape [GBIF-extent of occurrence (EOO) maps], the MaxEnt method of species distribution modelling (GBIF-MaxEnt maps) and the MaxEnt method but restricted to the area delimited by the $\alpha$-shape (GBIF-MaxEnt-restricted maps). Results: The location of hotspots and the latitudinal gradient in species richness or range sizes are relatively similar in the four procedures. GBIF-EOO maps and most GBIF-MaxEnt-maps provide overestimations of species richness when compared with those present in a priori well-surveyed cells. GBIF-EOO maps seem to provide more reasonable world macroecological patterns. MaxEnt can erroneously predict the presence of species in environmentally similar cells of another hemisphere or in other regions that lie outside the range of the species. Limiting this overpredictive capacity, as in the case of GBIF-MaxEnt-restricted maps, seems to mimic the frequency of observations derived from a simple point-to-grid procedure, with the utility of this procedure consequently being limited. Main conclusions: In studies of macroecological patterns at a global scale, the simple $\alpha$-shape method seems to be a more parsimonious option for extrapolating species distributions from primary data than are distribution models performed indiscriminately and automatically with MaxEnt. GBIF data may be used in macroecological patterns if original data are cleaned, autocorrelation is corrected and species richness figures do not constitute obvious underestimations. Efforts therefore should focus on improving the number and quality of records that can serve as the source of primary data in macroecological studies. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

Inhabiting peat swamps in Southeast Asia, threats affecting the species are mainly associated with habitat loss and illegal hunting.2.The effectiveness of the existing reserve network in Southeast Asia for the protection of the Sunda garial was assessed by combining spatially explicit habitat analyses derived from land cover information with species distribution modelling. Subsequently, possible improvements of the existing reserve network are derived from the habitat availability analyses.3.The results of the spatially explicit analyses indicate that suitable habitats for the Sunda gharial in Southeast Asia, i.e. peat swamps and riverine forests, are highly fragmented. Spatial coverage of remaining habitats with protected areas fulfilling IUCN standards generally varies among regions and is best in Indonesia. However, large, currently unprotected suitable areas remain in Sumatra. Establishment of 10 additional, already proposed reserves may improve the protection of major parts of the remaining suitable habitats of the Sunda gharial.4.According to the results of this study, the reserve network protecting this species could be significantly improved by expanding it to include seven national reserves not currently listed by the IUCN and an additional 10 reserves that have recently been proposed. Improvements and extensions of the existing reserve networks in Southeast Asia are pivotal to guarantee the long-term survival of the Sunda gharial. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Species distribution modeling has seen widespread use in ecology and conservation over the past two decades, and as a result many questions regarding the predictive capabilities of new techniques have been raised. One modeling approach that has gained popularity is Maxent, which uses presence-only data to model species distributions. Although Maxent is ordinarily used to model a species' fundamental niche at large scales (e.g., continental-scale), this technique was used to develop a predictive model for the realized niche and local breeding distribution of American Oystercatchers (Haematopus palliatus) in coastal New Jersey, USA. The transferability of the predictive model to locations outside training areas was examined in an effort to locate new breeding populations in previously unsurveyed areas. Initial model validation indicated that Maxent performed well, exhibiting good discrimination ability based on analyses of both training data (AUC = 0.95) and test data (AUC = 0.91). Ground surveys based on the final model located 185 previously unknown territorial pairs of American Oystercatchers, showing that Maxent was useful to locate new populations in alternative breeding habitats. However, when validated with an independent dataset, the Maxent model did not perform much better than random (AUC = 0.54), reporting high omission (0.76-0.93) and commission (0.40-0.83) error rates. The poor validation was attributed to source-sink dynamics rather than to errors in the modeling technique. Future researchers attempting to validate species distribution models with ground surveys should take into consideration metapopulation and source-sink theory in the design of surveys and interpretation of results.},

abstract = {Following a recent assessment of the distribution and habitat use of Gurney's Pitta in Myanmar (Burma), further extensive surveys were undertaken in 2010, 2011 and 2012. These have extended the species' known altitudinal limit to between 250 m and 300 m asl and its latitudinal limit to above 12.5°N, around 80 km north of the northernmost historical record, although the species was recorded far less frequently at higher altitudes and latitudes. Birds were recorded in a range of forested habitats, from intact primary forest to secondary and bamboo forest, with no significant difference between major forest types in the likelihood of occurrence. Niche envelope modelling (MaxEnt) suggested a total range size in Myanmar of 3,379 km2, and did not identify any potentially suitable areas in adjacent parts of Thailand. The species' preference for warmer, wetter areas on flat ground, conditions ideal for growing oil palm and rubber, suggest that its distribution is likely to contract in the near future. The entire range of Gurney's Pitta in Myanmar falls within the part of the country most suitable for commercial oil palm production, although the projected yields within its range are low to moderate. Field surveys found evidence of rapid recent deforestation and high levels of hunting and trapping in many parts of the region. The species' range in Myanmar does not overlap with any protected areas. The protection of southern Myanmar's biodiversity will require substantial investment by foreign conservation interests, sympathetic land-use planning and the strengthening of environment legislation. Protection of extensive tracts of lowland forest within the range of Gurney's Pitta, particularly the proposed Lenya National Park and the adjacent Ngawun and Htaung Pru Reserve Forests, is urgently needed. Conserving these areas will also protect populations of other globally threatened bird and mammal species. Copyright {\textcopyright} BirdLife International 2013A.},

This species is now threatened by illegal hunting and habitat destruction and, in Northeastern Mexico, their habitat has been fragmented and population sizes have been dramatically reduced. We use the MaxEnt algorithm to model the potential distribution of this elusive species, based on trustable presence records and information about their habitat condition. The aim of this study was to estimate the potential distribution of margays in Northeastern Mexico. We determined potential distribution in the physiographic subprovinces (PSP) of Llanuras y Lomerios, Gran Sierra Plegada and Carso Huasteco. A model was generated using recent and historical records through the MaxEnt algorithm. We used four records from online databases, 36 from literature and 13 from our own fieldwork, as well as 27 predictive variables: 19 associated with climate, two with land use and vegetation type, four associated with topography and two with anthropogenic effects. Seven variables contributed to over 90 {\%} of the distribution model and were highly predictive (AUC = 0.964). The potential distribution of margay represents 9.0 {\%} (7,607 km2) of the area, which is highly fragmented. The PSP Gran Sierra Plegada and Carso Huasteco showed the widest distribution range. The four most relevant variables were: precipitation of the most humid quarter, vegetation type, and both altitude and topographic indexes. We applied species distribution modeling by incorporating recent information collected through fieldwork and surveys as well as historical records in order to predict the margay's potential distribution in Northeastern Mexico. We obtained a robust model based on the most relevant bioclimatic and landscape variables. The landscape in this region is highly fragmented and the largest continuous areas were located in the roughest and inaccessible landscape of the mountainous localities of Gran Sierra Plegada and Carso Huasteco, where an important portion of these PSP maintains continuity in the area of the potential distribution of the margay. Very little is known of the status and abundance of the margay and this study complements our current knowledge of this species in Northeastern Mexico and provides important information regarding the quality of the habitat in this portion of the country. There are several current threats that are being caused by changes in land use in Northeastern Mexico and other parts of their distribution, and this information is essential to establish conservation plans for this species and their habitat. More studies assessing potential distribution throughout their range are needed to support adequate conservation efforts. {\textcopyright} 2016 Asociaci{\'{o}}n Mexicana de Mastozoolog{\'{i}}a.},

abstract = {Aim: We used newly identified fossil specimens to reconstruct the Quaternary distributions of five Microtus species (Rodentia: Arvicolinae) from the Pacific coast of the United States. We used these distributions to test the hypothesis that when projected onto past, alternative climate surfaces, species distribution models (SDMs) created using only climate variables are concordant with the empirical data of fossil Microtus species occurrences. Location: Specimens from 11 fossil localities in California, Oregon and Nevada were identified and evaluated. Methods: Geometric morphometrics and discriminant analyses were used to identify fossil Microtus specimens. Using a maximum-entropy modelling approach, the best model for all five species was selected using the Akaike information criterion. Nineteen bioclimate variables were used to create SDMs for the five Microtus species using both Community Climate System Model (CCSM) and Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) models. Results: We confidently identified 144 Microtus fossils, including the first fossil specimens of Microtus oregoni and Microtus townsendii. SDMs reconstructed approximately half the extralimital fossil occurrences (i.e. those found outside the present-day range). Those species with extralimital occurrences not reconstructed have niche models primarily influenced by precipitation variables. The two species whose extralimitals were well predicted occupy indistinguishable climatic niches. Main conclusions: The ranges of Pacific coast Microtus species have undergone substantial regional contractions since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21 ka). Inconsistencies between LGM SDMs and Quaternary fossil ranges indicate potential problems with LGM precipitation reconstructions, although interspecific interactions are also likely to contribute to these differences. Overall, the study highlights the need for further, detailed, species-level palaeodistributions to put recent observations in a broader temporal context and examine the effectiveness of SDMs coupled with climate models for predicting range dynamics under scenarios of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The polyphagous Asian vinegar fly Drosophila suzukii (spotted wing Drosophila) is a native of Eastern and Southeastern Asia. It emerged as an important invasive insect pest of berries and stone fruits in the Americas and Europe beginning in 2008. Species distribution models are commonly used for analyzing the extant and potential range expansion of invasive species. Previous modeling efforts for D. suzukii include a degree-day model, a MaxEnt ecological niche model, a demographic model incorporating the effects of temperature, and a preliminary mechanistic physiologically-based demographic model (PBDM). In the present analysis, we refine the PBDM for D. suzukii based on biological data reported in the literature. The PBDM is used to assess the effects of temperature and relative humidity from a recently published global climate dataset (AgMERRA) on the prospective geographic distribution and relative abundance of the pest in the USA and Mexico, and in Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. Our focus is on areas of recent invasion and of predicted higher invasiveness in these areas. Although the species is native to Asia and is of putative temperate origins, it has established in subtropical to north temperate zones worldwide where it infests a wide range of wild and domesticated berries and stone fruits. The model captures the observed phenology of D. suzukii at specific locations, as well as the potential geographic distribution and relative favorability across larger regions. The main limiting factor is cold winter temperature in northern areas, though high temperatures and low relative humidity may be limiting in arid areas. The effect of greater cold tolerance in winter morph adults is explored. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {This study details an application of eco-cultural niche modeling (ECNM) using two modeling architectures-a genetic algorithm (GARP) and maximum entropy (Maxent)-aimed at examining the ecological context of sites with archaeological remains attributed to the culture termed the Badegoulian (ca. 22-20. k. cal BP), which dates to the middle part of the Last Glacial Maximum (ca. 23-19. k. cal BP). We reconstructed the ecological niche of the Badegoulian and assessed whether eco-cultural niche variability existed within this technocomplex. We identified two broad but distinct spatial entities in the distribution of Badegoulian sites based on lithic raw material sources and circulation, and found that these spatial units share a similar ecological niche. We discuss the implications of territorial differentiation within this niche in light of research on land use by culturally affiliated groups within a broad cultural entity. We propose that Badegoulian circulation networks reflect distinct social territories associated with particular conditions within a single ecological niche. This study illustrates the utility of combining ecological niche reconstructions with archaeological data to identify and evaluate diachronic trends in cultural continuity for situations where such patterns may be missed when the focus of study is restricted solely to lithic technology and typology. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Leptospirosis is a water-borne and widespread spirochetal zoonosis caused by pathogenic bacteria called leptospires. Human leptospirosis is an important zoonotic infectious disease with frequent outbreaks in recent years in China. Leptospirosis's emergence has been linked to many environmental and ecological drivers of disease transmission. In this paper, we identified the environmental and socioeconomic factors associated with leptospirosis in China, and predict potential risk area of leptospirosis using predictive models. Methods: Leptospirosis incidence data were derived from the database of China's web-based infectious disease reporting system, a national surveillance network maintained by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We built statistical relationship between occurrence of leptospirosis and nine environmental and socioeconomic risk factors using logistic regression model and Maxent model. Results: Both logistic regression model and Maxent model have high performance in predicting the occurrence of leptospirosis, with AUC value of 0.95 and 0.96, respectively. Annual mean temperature (Bio1) and annual total precipitation (Bio12) are two most important variables governing the geographic distribution of leptospirosis in China. The geographic distributions of areas at risk of leptospirosis predicted from both models show high agreement. The risk areas are located mainly in seven provinces of China: Sichuan Province, Chongqing Municipality, Hunan Province, Jiangxi Province, Guangdong Province, Guangxi Province, and Hainan Province, where surveillance and control programs are urgently needed. Logistic regression model and Maxent model predicted that 403 and 464 counties are at very high risk of leptospirosis, respectively. Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of socioeconomic and environmental variables and predictive models in identifying risk areas for leptospirosis in China. The values of Geographic Information System and predictive models were demonstrated for investigating the geographic distribution, estimating socioeconomic and environmental risk factors, and enhancing our understanding of leptospirosis in China. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Despite its widespread occurrence globally, wildfire preferentially occupies an environmental middle ground and is significantly less prevalent in biomes characterized by environmental extremes (e.g., tundra, rain forests, and deserts). We evaluated the biophysical ''environmental space'' of wildfire from regional to subcontinental extents, with methods widely used for modeling habitat distributions. This approach is particularly suitable for the biogeographic study of wildfire, because it simultaneously considers patterns in multiple factors controlling wildfire suitability over large areas. We used the Maxent and boosted regression tree algorithms to assess wildfire-environment relationships for three levels of complexity (in terms of inclusion of variables) at three spatial scales: the conterminous United States, the state of California, and five wildfire-prone ecoregions of California. The resulting models were projected geographically to obtain spatial predictions of wildfire suitability and were also applied to other regions to assess their generality and spatial transferability. Predictions of the potential range of wildfire had high classification accuracy; they also highlighted areas where wildfires had not recently been observed, indicating the potential (or past) suitability of these areas. The models identified several key variables that were not suspected to be important in the large-scale control of wildfires, but which might indirectly affect control by influencing the presence of flammable vegetation. Models transferred to different areas were useful only when they overlapped appreciably with the target area's environmental space. This approach should allow exploration of the potential shifts in wildfire range in a changing climate, the potential for restoration of wildfire where it has been ''extirpated,'' and, conversely, the ''invasiveness'' of wildfire after changes in plant species composition. Our study demonstrates that habitat distribution models and related concepts can be used to characterize environmental controls on a natural disturbance process, but also that future work is needed to refine our understanding of the direct causal factors controlling wildfire at multiple spatial scales.},

New techniques such as ecological niche modelling have the potential to aid in addressing many broad questions in ecology, evolutionary biology, and behavioural ecology. 2. This study combines broad-scale ecological niche models with fine-scaled studies of biotic interactions to examine how abiotic and biotic interactions affect the spatial distribution of the terrestrial salamander species Plethodon glutinosus (northern slimy salamander), in a potential contact zone shared with Plethodon mississippi (Mississippi slimy salamander). 3. The core habitat in the interior portion of the range of P. glutinosus and the contact zone are distributed in unique environmental niche space. 4. The form of competition, inter- or intraspecific, significantly affected mass loss of adult salamanders. Salamanders lost more mass when interacting with a heterospecific. 5. Abiotic conditions strongly influenced the impact of competition on salamanders. Under stressful environmental conditions at the field site located in the contact zone, salamanders lost more mass than at the field site located in the interior of the range. 6. Furthermore, adult salamanders from range-edge populations and core populations (from the interior of the range) differed in their respective abilities to compete under the abiotic conditions in the contact zone. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Landing a rescue helicopter in a wilderness environment, such as Yosemite National Park, requires suitable areas that are flat, devoid of tree canopy, and not within close proximity to other hazards. The objective of this study was to identify helicopter landing areas that are most likely to exist based on available geographic data using two GIScience methods. The first approach produced an expert model that was derived from predefined feature constraints based on existing knowledge of helicopter landing area requirements (weighted overlay algorithm). The second model is derived using a machine learning technique (maximum entropy algorithm, Maxent) that derives feature constraints from existing presence-only points; that is, geographic one-class data. Both models yielded similar output and successfully classified test coordinates, but Maxent was more efficient and required no user-defined weighting that is typically subject to human bias or disagreement. The pros and cons of each approach are discussed and the comparison reveals important considerations for a variety of future land suitability studies, including ecological niche modeling. The conclusion is that the two approaches complement each other. Overall, we produced an effective geographic information system product to support the identification of suitable landing areas in emergent rescue situations. To our knowledge, this is the first GIScience study focused on estimating the location of landing zones for a search-and-rescue application. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Aim: Advancement in ecological methods predicting species distributions is a crucial precondition for deriving sound management actions. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models are a popular tool to predict species distributions, as they are considered able to cope well with sparse, irregularly sampled data and minor location errors. Although a fundamental assumption of MaxEnt is that the entire area of interest has been systematically sampled, in practice, MaxEnt models are usually built from occurrence records that are spatially biased towards better-surveyed areas. Two common, yet not compared, strategies to cope with uneven sampling effort are spatial filtering of occurrence data and background manipulation using environmental data with the same spatial bias as occurrence data. We tested these strategies using simulated data and a recently collated dataset on Malay civet Viverra tangalunga in Borneo. Location: Borneo, Southeast Asia. Methods: We collated 504 occurrence records of Malay civets from Borneo of which 291 records were from 2001 to 2011 and used them in the MaxEnt analysis (baseline scenario) together with 25 environmental input variables. We simulated datasets for two virtual species (similar to a range-restricted highland and a lowland species) using the same number of records for model building. As occurrence records were biased towards north-eastern Borneo, we investigated the efficacy of spatial filtering versus background manipulation to reduce overprediction or underprediction in specific areas. Results: Spatial filtering minimized omission errors (false negatives) and commission errors (false positives). We recommend that when sample size is insufficient to allow spatial filtering, manipulation of the background dataset is preferable to not correcting for sampling bias, although predictions were comparatively weak and commission errors increased. Main Conclusions: We conclude that a substantial improvement in the quality of model predictions can be achieved if uneven sampling effort is taken into account, thereby improving the efficacy of species conservation planning. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

Among the species belonging to this genus, Architeuthis dux has received special attention from biologists. The distribution of this species is poorly understood, as most of our information stems from stranded animals or stomach remains. Predicting the habitat and distribution of this species, and more in general of difficult to observe species, is important from a biological conservation perspective. In this paper, we present an approach to estimate the potential distribution of A. dux at global scale, with relative high resolution (1-degree). Our approach relies on a complex preparation phase, which improves the reliability of presence, absence and environmental data correlated to the species habitat. We compare our distribution with those produced by state-of-the-art approaches (MaxEnt and AquaMaps), and use an expert-drawn map as reference. We demonstrate that our model projection is in agreement with the expert's map and is also compliant with several biological assessments of the species habitat and with recent observations. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be generalized as a paradigm that is applicable to other rare species. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

We introduce two methods that aim to improve the transferability of presence-only models: density-based occurrence thinning and performance-based predictor selection. We evaluate the effect of these methods along with the impact of the choice of model complexity and geographic background on the transferability of a species distribution model between geographic regions. Our multifactorial experiment focuses on the notorious invasive seaweed Caulerpa cylindracea Caulerpa subspecies and uses Maxent, a commonly used presence-only modeling technique. We show that model transferability is markedly improved by appropriate predictor selection, with occurrence thinning, model complexity and background choice having relatively minor effects. The data shows that, if available, occurrence records from the native and invaded regions should be combined as this leads to models with high predictive power while reducing the sensitivity to choices made in the modeling process. The inferred distribution model of Caulerpa cylindracea shows the potential for this species to further spread along the coasts of Western Europe, western Africa and the south coast of Australia. {\textcopyright} 2013 Verbruggen et al.},

Other groups of factors like total precipitation and isthermality determined the distribution of P. crassifolia and P. glabra, respectively.

Furthermore, discrepancies between mapped and actual stream length vary between watersheds, confounding efforts to understand the impacts of land use on stream ecosystems. Here we report on research that predicts stream presence from coupled field observations of headwater stream channels and terrain variables that were calculated both locally and as an average across the watershed upstream of any location on the landscape. Our approach used maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt), a robust method commonly implemented to model species distributions that requires information only on the presence of the entity of interest. In validation, the method correctly predicts the presence of 86{\%} of all 10-m stream segments and errors are low ({\textless}1{\%}) for catchments larger than 10 ha. We apply this model to the entire Potomac River watershed (37,800 km2) and several adjacent watersheds to map stream density and compare our results with the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). We find that NHD underestimates stream density by up to 250{\%}, with errors being greatest in the densely urbanized cities of Washington, DC and Baltimore, MD and in regions where the NHD has never been updated from its original, coarse-grain mapping. This work is the most ambitious attempt yet to map stream networks over a large region and will have lasting implications for modeling and conservation efforts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elmore et al.},

Because no information is available for anthropogenic habitats, this study aimed to describe the species occurrence in a highly fragmented and heterogeneous landscape in southeastern Brazil. C. thous was surveyed in 95 study sites in four main land covers (native forest, eucalyptus forest, sugar cane and pasture) from April to September 2006. Presence records (n=28) and landscape variables (land cover, heterogeneity, stream and forest fragment distance, elevation and slope) were used for modeling in Maxent. The bootstrapping method was used for sampling 70{\%} of the dataset for training and 30{\%} for testing models. The species was equally distributed in all types of land cover, although it was more frequent in the sugar cane areas and more associated with forest fragments and heterogeneous habitats. The potential distribution model predicted forest patches and its surroundings as highly suitable for the species. It also predicted part of the sugar cane matrix as highly suitable, probably related to prey availability. Results suggested that the anthropogenic landscape studied encompasses many suitable habitats for species occurrence, resulting in the necessity to assess its potential role in vertebrate communities. {\textcopyright} 2010 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin New York.},

We applied eigenvector-based spatial filters as independent variables, in addition to environmental variables, to resolve spatial autocorrelation, and compared the model's accuracy and the degree of spatial autocorrelation with those of a model estimated using only environmental variables. We were able to identify areas of high suitability for Bd with accuracy. Among the environmental variables, factors related to temperature and precipitation were more effective in predicting the potential distribution of Bd than factors related to land use and cover type. Our study successfully predicted the potential distribution of Bd in East and Southeast Asia. This information should now be used to prioritize survey areas and generate a surveillance program to detect the pathogen. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2015.},

abstract = {A general probabilistic inference procedure is proposed in this paper based on the Maximum relative Entropy (MrE) approach which generalizes both Bayesian and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) inference methodologies. The construction of the conditional probability (likelihood function) for general model-based inference problems is discussed in detail to systematically manage uncertainties from mechanism modeling, model parameters, and measurements. Analytical and numerical examples are used to investigate the sequence effect in the probabilistic inference using point observations and moment constraints. The developed methodology is applied to the engineering fatigue crack growth problem with experimental data for demonstration and validation. Following this, a detailed comparison between the classical Bayesian inference and the MrE inference is given. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Despite some populations of European wildcat Felis silvestris in central Europe are stable or increasing, the Iberian subpopulation is in decline and is listed as 'vulnerable'. In Portugal, little is known about wildcat populations, making conservation policies extremely difficult to define. Furthermore, the secretive behaviour of these mammals, along with low population densities, make data collection complicated. Thus, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical tools to interpret existing data for this species. In this study, we determine the home-range size and environmental factors related to wildcat spatial ecology in a Mediterranean ecosystem using a combined analysis of habitat selection and maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling. Simultaneously, we test the feasibility of using radio-tracking locations to construct an ecologically meaningful distribution model. Six wildcats were captured and tracked. The average home-range size (MCP95) was 2.28 km2 for females and 13.71 km 2 for one male. The Maxent model built from radio-tracking locations indicated that the abundance of the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus and limited human disturbance were the most important correlates of wildcat presence. Habitat selection analysis revealed that wildcats tend to use scrubland areas significantly more than expected by chance. A mosaic of scrublands and agricultural areas, with a higher proportion of the former, benefits wildcat presence in the study area; however, species distribution is mainly constrained by availability of prey and resting sites. The Maxent model validation with camera-trapping data indicated that highly adequate model performance. This technique may prove useful for recovering small radio-tracking datasets as it provides a new alternative for handling data and maximizing the ecological information on a target population, which can then be used for conservation planning. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Zoological Society of London.},

This timespan witnessed the rise, collapse and redevelopment of urbanized society and settlement during the Bronze Age. This study applies GIS and statistical modeling tools (MAXENT) to vegetation data from 1696 historical and modern observation points across the region to chart potential vegetation for the present and at 100-year intervals between 5500 and 3000 calibrated years BP. A macrophysical climate model is used to create vegetation maps based on regional temperature and precipitation data. Environmental dynamics tracked over this time period, including past vegetation, temperature and precipitation, are applied to the interpretation of Bronze Age settlement and social change. Our results reveal a general trend of Mediterranean forest contraction through the Bronze Age. The "4.2 event" (ca. 4200 calibrated years BP) potentially links regional desiccation and urban collapse, and constitutes the last element in a trajectory of reduced potential forest vegetation through the Early Bronze Age. Rapid woodland expansion correlates with abrupt cooling and reurbanization at the outset of the Middle Bronze Age. Modeled vegetation shows minimum forest and maximum desert coverage consistent with a Late Bronze Age "crisis" ca. 3000 calibrated years BP. In comparison to the Bronze Age, modern potential vegetation includes the broadest extent of steppe. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

We provide a tool for simulating uncertainty, focusing on uncertainty due to data quality. We illustrate the use of the tool using a Tasmanian endemic species as a case study. Our simulations provide probabilistic, spatially explicit illustrations of the impact of uncertainty on model projections. We also illustrate differences in model projections using six different global climate models and two contrasting emissions scenarios. Our case study results illustrate how different sources of uncertainty have different impacts on model output and how the geographic distribution of uncertainty can vary.

abstract = {Background: Ectoparasites exhibit pronounced variation in life history characteristics such as time spent on the host and host range. Since contemporary species distribution (SD) modelling does not account for differences in life history, the accuracy of predictions of current and future species' ranges could differ significantly between life history groups. Results: SD model performance was compared between 21 flea species that differ in microhabitat preferences and level of host specificity. Distribution models generally performed well, with no significant differences in model performance based on either microhabitat preferences or host specificity. However, the relative importance of predictor variables was significantly related to host specificity, with the distribution of host-opportunistic fleas strongly limited by thermal conditions and host-specific fleas more associated with conditions that restrict their hosts' distribution. The importance of temperature was even more pronounced when considering microhabitat preference, with the distribution of fur fleas being strongly limited by thermal conditions and nest fleas more associated with variables that affect microclimatic conditions in the host nest. Conclusions: Contemporary SD modelling, that includes climate and landscape variables, is a valuable tool to study the biogeography and future distributions of fleas and other parasites taxa. However, consideration of life history characteristics is cautioned as species may be differentially sensitive to environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2016 van der Mescht et al.},

We found habitats suitable for M. japonicum in the major mountains in southeastern, southern, and southwestern China, and also in the Changbai Mountains, Taihang Mountains, Yanshan Mountains, Tainwan and Hainan Island. With increasing percent of tree cover, mean temperatures in the driest quarter, the warmest quarter and the coldest quarter, and with decreasing annual temperature range and mean diurnal temperature range, habitat suitability for M. japonicum increases. The MaxEnt model also indicated that areas with precipitation of the wettest month being 300 mm, and precipitation of the warmest quarter being 500-600 mm are favourable for M. japonicum. It also favours lower altitudes (0-1000 m a.s.l.), while with increasing altitude (from 1000 to 6000 m a.s.l.), habitat suitability decreases. Habitat suitability for M. japonicum firstly increases rapidly with increasing precipitation in the driest month and the coldest quarter at lower altitudes, and then slightly increases after the factors exceed a certain threshold value. {\textcopyright} Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board 2013.},

abstract = {Scaling is a key process in modelling approaches since it allows for translating information from one scale to another. However, the success of this procedure may depend on 'source' and 'target' scales, but also on the biogeographic/ecological context of the study area. We aimed to quantify the performance and success of scaling species distribution model (SDM) predictions across spatial resolution and extent along a biogeographic gradient using the Iberian mole as study case. We ran separate MaxEnt models at two extents (national and regional) using independent datasets (species locations and environmental predictors) collected at 10 km and 50 m resolutions respectively. Model performance and success of scaling SDMs were quantified on the basis of accuracy measures and spatial predictions. Complementarily, we calculated marginality and tolerance as indicators of habitat availability and niche truncation along the biogeographic gradient. Model performance increased with resolution and extent, as well as from north to south (mainly for high resolution models). When regional models were validated at different scales, their performance reduced severely, particularly in the case of coarse resolution models (some of them performed worse than random). However, when the 10 km-national model was downscaled within regions, it performed better (AUCtest: 0.82, 0.85 and 0.55 respectively for Galicia, Madrid and Granada) than models specifically calibrated within each region at 10 km (0.47, 0.65, 0.44). Indeed, it also had a better accuracy when projected at 50 m (0.77, 0.91, 0.79) than models fitted at that resolution (0.62, 0.83, 0.96) in two of the three cases. The success of scaling model predictions decreased along the biogeographic gradient, being these differences associated to niche truncation. Models representing non-truncated niches were more successfully scaled across resolutions and extents (particularly in areas not offering all possible habitats for species), which has important implications for SDM applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

I aim to test to what extent this assumption is true by comparing commonly-used invasive plant distribution datasets to abundance records. I compared herbarium occurrence records (downloaded from an online database) and regional occurrence records (compiled from individual states) to abundance estimates collected from over 300 invasive plant experts for 9 invasive species in the western U.S. I also created habitat suitability models (HSMs) using these datasets and compared the areas of predicted suitability. Sixty percent of the time, herbarium occurrences were located in regions where the species was rare enough to be undetected by experts, while only 26 {\%} coincided with locations identified as having high abundance. Regional occurrences were located in areas where the species was not detected 32 {\%} of the time, and on high abundance 42 {\%} of the time. HSMs based on herbarium records encompassed 89 {\%} of land area at risk of abundance, but overestimated the area of estimated risk (27-46 {\%} false positive rate). HSMs based on regional occurrences had a smaller false positive rate (22-31 {\%}), but encompassed only 67-68 {\%} of area suitable for abundance. Herbarium records are strongly skewed towards locations with low invasive plant abundance, leading to invasion risk models that vastly overestimate abundance risk. Models based on occurrence points should be interpreted as risk of establishment only, not risk of abundance or impact. If HSMs aim to be more management relevant, invasion risk models should include abundance as well as occurrence. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Since helminths depend on multiple environmental factors that make their transmission possible, it is imperative to predict the areas where these parasites may complete the transmission to potential hosts. Bobcats, Lynx rufus (Schreberer), are the most abundant and widely-distributed wild felid species in North America. The increase of population densities of bobcats raises concerns about their importance as reservoirs of pathogens and parasites that may affect wildlife, domestic animals and humans. Our objective was to predict the potential presence of the tapeworm Taenia rileyi Loewen, 1929, the fluke Alaria marcianae (La Rue, 1917) and the roundworm Toxocara cati (Schrank, 1788) in southern Illinois. The empirical presence of these parasites in localities across the region was analysed in combination with a sampling bias layer (i.e. bobcat presence) and with environmental data: layers of water, soil, land cover, human density and climate variables in MAXENT to create maps of potential presence for these three species in an area of 46 436 km2. All climatic variables were low contributors (0.0-2.0{\%} contribution to model creation) whereas land cover surfaced as an important variable for the presence of A. marcianae (7.6{\%}) and T. cati (6.3{\%}); human density (4.8{\%}) was of secondary importance for T. rileyi. Variables of importance likely represent habitat requirements necessary for the completion of parasite life cycles. Larger areas of potential presence were found for the feline specialist T. rileyi (85{\%}) while potential presence was less likely for A. marcianae (73{\%}), a parasite that requires multiple aquatic intermediate hosts. This study provides information to wildlife biologists and health officials regarding the potential impacts of growing bobcat populations in combination with complex and changing environmental factors. {\textcopyright} Institute of Parasitology, Biology Centre ASCR.},

Drosophila suzukii have a rapid expansion worldwide; occurrences were recorded in North America and Europe in 2008, and South America in 2013. Due to this rapid expansion, we modeled the potential distribution of this species using the Maximum Entropy Modeling (MaxEnt) algorithm and the Genetic Algorithm for Ruleset Production (GARP) using 407 sites with known occurrences worldwide and 11 predictor variables. After 1000 replicates, the value of the average area under the curve (AUC) of the model predictions with 1000 replicates was 0.97 for MaxEnt and 0.87 for GARP, indicating that both models had optimal performances. The environmental variables that most influenced the prediction of the MaxEnt model were the annual mean temperature, the maximum temperature of the warmest month, the mean temperature of the coldest quarter and the annual precipitation. The models indicated high environmental suitability, mainly in temperate and subtropical areas in the continents of Asia, Europe and North and South America, where the species has already been recorded. The potential for further invasions of the African and Australian continents is predicted due to the environmental suitability of these areas for this species. {\textcopyright} 2017 dos Santos et al.

Apple maggot is found only in North America and negatively impacts the apple industry in the western United States by reducing grower access to export markets. To reduce the threat of apple maggot to export countries and to facilitate the movement of commercial apples, an assessment of potential risk of establishment of apple maggot is needed to predict which regions are suitable or unsuitable for the fly. We used a correlative niche model MaxEnt and a mechanistic model CLIMEX to model global potential risk of establishment of apple maggot. The MaxEnt model was developed by integrating apple maggot occurrences with global climatic variables. Apple (a major host of apple maggot) climatic suitability was used as an additional variable to include species interactions in the MaxEnt model. The CLIMEX model was developed using published apple maggot physiological tolerance thresholds. Both the MaxEnt and CLIMEX models correctly predicted the known distribution of apple maggot in North America, met biological expectations when projected to the world, and mostly agreed on climatic suitability worldwide for the fly. Degree-days at 6.7 °C, elevation, precipitation seasonality, and apple climatic suitability were the most important predictors associated with apple maggot distribution in North America. Our results can be used to make science-based international trade decisions by policy makers, and for monitoring apple maggot potential introductions in countries where it currently does not occur. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.},

Without having used the nature reserves' and conservancy's boundary as an input in the maximum entropy model, the model was mapping out the high probability of buffalo and elephant presence to coincide within their boundaries. The analysis of the habitat condition show that higher presence of wildlife in the nature reserves compared with cultivated areas is not dependent on the abundance of green biomass, proximity to surface water, or terrain slope, since these do not significantly differ between nature reserves and communal lands. We conclude that the presence of agricultural fields contributes more in shaping the habitats of both buffalo and elephant than other environmental variables. In the communal lands where the agricultural fields are concentrated along the rivers elephants and buffalo are pushed away from the rivers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Species introduction represents one of the most serious threats for biodiversity. The realized climatic niche of an invasive species can be used to predict its potential distribution in new areas, providing a basis for screening procedures in the compilation of black and white lists to prevent new introductions. We tested this assertion by modeling the realized climatic niche of the Eastern grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis. Maxent was used to develop three models: one considering only records from the native range (NRM), a second including records from native and invasive range (NIRM), a third calibrated with invasive occurrences and projected in the native range (RCM). Niche conservatism was tested considering both a niche equivalency and a niche similarity test. NRM failed to predict suitable parts of the currently invaded range in Europe, while RCM underestimated the suitability in the native range. NIRM accurately predicted both the native and invasive range. The niche equivalency hypothesis was rejected due to a significant difference between the grey squirrel's niche in native and invasive ranges. The niche similarity test yielded no significant results. Our analyses support the hypothesis of a shift in the species' climatic niche in the area of introductions. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) appear to be a useful tool in the compilation of black lists, allowing identifying areas vulnerable to invasions. We advise caution in the use of SDMs based only on the native range of a species for the compilation of white lists for other geographic areas, due to the significant risk of underestimating its potential invasive range. {\textcopyright} 2013 Di Febbraro et al.},

abstract = {Different techniques of species distribution modeling were applied to evaluate the distribution of eight benthic marine species in Icelandic waters. The species examined were Symplectoscyphus tricuspidatus, Stegopoma plicatile (both Hydrozoa), Prionospio cirrifera, Amphicteis gunneri (both Polychaeta), Desmosoma strombergi, Eurycope producta (both Isopoda), Andaniella pectinata and Harpinia crenulata (both Amphipoda). Information on 13 environmental variables (temperature mean, temperature mean SD, temperature minimum, temperature maximum, salinity mean, salinity mean SD, oxygen content, particulate organic carbon, seasonal variation index, bottom roughness, sediment thickness, acidification) and records of occurrences of these eight species was collated in an ArcGIS project. Modeling methods applied were MARS, TreeNet, and MaxENT. According to area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) model assessment values, models with moderate to outstanding discriminatory power were found for all species. There was a good overlap in the overall pattern of prediction for most species independent on the modeling technique. Among the three applied techniques MARS seemed to generalize most whereas TreeNet predictions very precisely reflected information from the training data set. The distribution of the selected benthic invertebrate species in Icelandic waters could be linked to a variety of environmental factors related to oceanography, seabed topography and human impact. Their multivariate interactions acted as a structuring force of species distribution, instead of just their one by one individual influence. The selected predictors varied between the different models for the same species. They substituted each other in different models. The expected distribution of the examined species was mapped for a seascape of known environmental settings. Such maps will serve as excellent references in future impact studies and enable the detection of changes in the distribution of benthic marine invertebrates. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Assuming that genetically diverse populations of bees are less likely to suffer the harmful effects of inbreeding and better able to avoid an extinction vortex related to the sex determination mechanism, the identification of putative areas in which diversity is concentrated should be focus of a discussion. Models of historical climate stability constitute an elegant manner of inferring such areas. The aim of the present study was to model the potential distribution of stingless bees in different periods of climate extremes of the Late Quaternary and the current day. A spatially-explicit model was designed to predict areas in which genetic diversity is putatively concentrated in an assemblage of nineteen species in the southern Atlantic Forest, Brazil. These climatically-stable areas (i.e., refuges) were mainly recorded in three portions of coastal forests in southeastern Brazil, regions that concentrate areas of high to extreme importance to the conservation of biological diversity. Such regions have differences regarding size and suitability scores and are distributed within the southern Atlantic Forest Central Corridor (SCC), as well as the northern (NSM) and southern Serra do Mar Corridor (SSM). Considering that refuges historically harbor high degrees of genetic diversity, these three regions are indicated as those of high importance to the conservation of stingless bees in the Atlantic Forest. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {Background: Culex tritaeniorhynchus is the primary vector of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a leading cause of encephalitis in Asia. JEV is transmitted in an enzootic cycle involving large wading birds as the reservoirs and swine as amplifying hosts. The development of a JEV vaccine reduced the number of JE cases in regions with comprehensive childhood vaccination programs, such as in Japan and the Republic of Korea. However, the lack of vaccine programs or insufficient coverage of populations in other endemic countries leaves many people susceptible to JEV. The aim of this study was to predict the distribution of Culex tritaeniorhynchus using ecological niche modeling. Methods/Principal Findings: An ecological niche model was constructed using the Maxent program to map the areas with suitable environmental conditions for the Cx. tritaeniorhynchus vector. Program input consisted of environmental data (temperature, elevation, rainfall) and known locations of vector presence resulting from an extensive literature search and records from MosquitoMap. The statistically significant Maxent model of the estimated probability of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus presence showed that the mean temperatures of the wettest quarter had the greatest impact on the model. Further, the majority of human Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases were located in regions with higher estimated probability of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus presence. Conclusions/Significance: Our ecological niche model of the estimated probability of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus presence provides a framework for better allocation of vector control resources, particularly in locations where JEV vaccinations are unavailable. Furthermore, this model provides estimates of vector probability that could improve vector surveillance programs and JE control efforts.},

abstract = {Two small swards of two grass species (Agrostis stolonifera and Agrostis capillaris) previously unrecorded on Macquarie Island (54°30′S, 158°56′E) were found during the 2013–2014 austral summer. Their discovery leads to an assessment of their introduction status and invasive risk. Several evaluations were conducted on the plants regarding their extent, taxonomy, reproductive status and invasive potential. It is possible that the two species were accidentally introduced by human activities due to their proximity to human-frequented sites. No further occurrences were found, indicating that although the species were established, they were, respectively, restricted to two small swards of less than 1 m2 each. Observations of floral development in the field at the end of summer suggested that no sexually reproductive material was produced. Indoor cultivation of sampled specimens at the island station showed a faster development with mature flowers at the end of the summer but still no seeds. The bioclimatic niches of the two species were modeled with MaxEnt software. Biomodeling results indicate that reasonably favorable habitat is available on Macquarie Island for the successful colonization of both species. Agrostis stolonifera showed a higher invasion risk than A. capillaris. Our observations indicate that the two species are strong candidates for invading the island despite having phenological constraints. As a result, the two swards were removed by the island's management authority. Further introductions and establishment of non-native plant species are expected to occur on sub-Antarctic islands under current global change scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Systematic species surveys over large areas are mostly not affordable, constraining conservation planners to make best use of incomplete data. Spatially explicit species distribution models (SDM) may be useful to detect and compensate for incomplete information. SDMs can either be based on standardized, systematic sampling in a restricted subarea, or - as a cost-effective alternative - on data haphazardly collated by "volunteer-based monitoring schemes" (VMS), area-wide but inherently biased and of heterogeneous spatial precision. Using data on capercaillie Tetrao urogallus, we evaluated the capacity of SDMs generated from incomplete survey data to localise unknown areas inhabited by the species and to predict relative local observation density. Addressing the trade-off between data precision, sample size and spatial extent of the sampling area, we compared three different sampling strategies: VMS-data collected throughout the whole study area (7000 km2) using either 1) exact locations or 2) locations aggregated to grid cells of the size of an average individual home range, and 3) systematic transect counts conducted within a small subarea (23.8 km2). For each strategy, we compared two sample sizes and two modelling methods (ENFA and Maxent), which were evaluated using cross-validation and independent data. Models based on VMS-data (strategies 1 and 2) performed equally well in predicting relative observation density and in localizing "unknown" occurrences. They always outperformed strategy 3-models, irrespective of sample size and modelling method, partly because the VMS-data provided the more comprehensive clues for setting the discrimination-threshold for predicting presence or absence. Accounting for potential errors due to extrapolation (e.g. projections outside the environmental domain or potentially biasing variables) reduced, but did not fully compensate for the observed discrepancies. As they cover a broader range of species-habitat relations, the area-wide data achieved a better model quality with less a-priori knowledge. Furthermore, in a highly mobile species like capercaillie a sampling resolution corresponding to an individuals' home range can lead to equally good predictions as the use of exact locations. Consequently, when a trade-off between the sampling effort and the spatial extent of the sampling area is necessary, less precise data unsystematically collected over a large representative region are preferable to systematically sampled data from a restricted region. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.},

abstract = {Due to socioeconomic differences, the accuracy and extent of reporting on the occurrence of native species differs among countries, which can impact the performance of species distribution models. We assessed the importance of geographical biases in occurrence data on model performance using Hydrilla verticillata as a case study. We used Maxent to predict potential North American distribution of the aquatic invasive macrophyte based upon training data from its native range. We produced a model using all available native range occurrence data, then explored the change in model performance produced by omitting subsets of training data based on political boundaries. We also compared those results with models trained on data from which a random sample of occurrence data was omitted from across the native range. Although most models accurately predicted the occurrence of H. verticillata in North America (AUC {\textgreater} 0.7600), data omissions influenced model predictions. Omitting data based on political boundaries resulted in larger shifts in model accuracy than omitting randomly selected occurrence data. For well-documented species like H. verticillata, missing records from single countries or ecoregions may minimally influence model predictions, but for species with fewer documented occurrences or poorly understood ranges, geographic biases could misguide predictions. Regardless of focal species, we recommend that future species distribution modeling efforts begin with a reflection on potential spatial biases of available occurrence data. Improved biodiversity surveillance and reporting will provide benefit not only in invaded ranges but also within under-reported and unexplored native ranges. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

To create a reliable model, we used all Aquatic Warbler presences in the study area since 1990 as well as additional potentially suitable habitats identified in the field. We combined the presence/absence regression tree algorithm Cubist with the presence-only algorithm Maxent since both commonly outperform other algorithms. To integrate the separate model results, we present a new way to create a metamodel using the initial model results as variables. Additionally, a histogram approach was applied to further reduce the final search area to the most promising sites. Accuracy increased when using both remote sensing and environmental data.

abstract = {Aim: Application of environmental envelope modelling (EEM) for conservation planning requires careful validation. Opinions of experts who have worked with species of interest in the field can be a valuable and independent information source to validate EEM because of their first-hand experience with species occurrence and absence. However, their use in model validation is limited because of the subjectivity of their feedback. In this study, we present a method on the basis of cultural consensus theory to formalize expert model evaluations. Methods: We developed, for five tree species, distribution models with nine different variable combinations and Maxent EEM software. Species specialists validated the generated distribution maps through an online Google Earth interface with the scores from Invalid to Excellent. Experts were also asked about the commission and omission errors of the distribution models they evaluated. We weighted expert scores according to consensus theory. These values were used to obtain a final average expert score for each of the produced distribution models. The consensus-weighted expert scores were compared with un-weighted scores and correlated to four conventional model performance parameters after cross-validation with test data: Area Under Curve (AUC), maximum Kappa, commission error and omission error. Results: The median consensus-weighted expert score of all species-variable combinations was close to Fair. In general, experts that reached more consensus with peers were more positive about the EEM outcomes, compared to those that had more opposite judgements. Both consensus-weighted and un-weighted scores were significantly correlated to corresponding AUC, maximum Kappa and commission error values, but not to omission errors. More than half of the experts indicated that the distribution model they considered best included areas where the species is known to be absent. One third also indicated areas of species presence that were omitted by the model. Conclusions: Our results indicate that experts are fairly positive about EEM outcomes. This is encouraging, but EEM application for conservation actions remains limited according to them. Methods to formalize expert knowledge allow a wider use of this information in model validation and improvement, and they complement conventional validation methods of presence-only modelling. Online GIS and survey applications facilitate the consultation of experts. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

Here we explore the effect of a known spatial bias on the predictive ability of Maxent models, using five species of the genus Asplenium with variable reproductive modes. The models were trained and tested on western and central European presence-only distributional data, first with random background and then with target-group background. Then we tested the models on an independent Ukrainian dataset of the same species, using the area under the curve (AUC) value as test statistic. We carried out a principal components analysis (PCA) on the collection localities of the individual species to explore the properties of their ecological niches. In all but one species, spatial bias in the distributional data resulted in poor performance of the Maxent models (trained on the European dataset and tested on the Ukrainian dataset). In all species correction for sampling bias resulted in significantly wider predicted climatic niches. Based on the results of the PCA, spatial bias resulted in environmental bias of variable degree. We argue that species reproductive biology should be taken into account when distributional data are analysed in terms of their suitability for species distribution modelling. The reported results will inform biodiversity conservation assessments, particularly those using data from natural history collections. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Natural History Museum.},

abstract = {MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) modelling method is probably the most popular technique to model species distributions based only on the presence records across broad spatial scales. Although it is widely used, there is much controversy about the transferability of models between different geographical areas. Transferability might be more questionable when it comes to predict the distribution of peripheral populations at the margin of the species geographical range, where they may be affected by and adapted to environmental conditions different from those of core populations. To explore transferability of MaxEnt models among sectors of the geographic range, we selected three butterfly species with wide distributions and peripheral populations at their southernmost margin in the Iberian Peninsula, namely Plebejus argus, Cyaniris semiargus and Pyronia tithonus.Using data from the Atlas of the butterflies of the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands as well as both climate and land use data, we modelled their potential distribution ranges in Spain. In addition, we also independently modelled their distributions separately in three concentric sectors of their range. We then investigated the transferability of the models between sectors and the effect of varying the regularization parameter.Our results show that when developing species distribution models the quality of occurrence data should be carefully checked, paying special attention to both their number and spatial distribution and avoiding possible significant biases.The transferability of the models tends to decrease when data from increasingly distant sectors are used as test data. More precisely, and independently of the regularization parameter value, models built using occurrence data either from the core or the intermediate sectors failed to adequately predict the distribution of the three butterfly species in the peripheral sector, especially in Do{\~{n}}ana National Park. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Many nature reserves are established to protect the habitat needs of particular endangered species of interest but their effectiveness for protecting other species is questionable. In this study, this effectiveness was evaluated in a nature reserve network located in the Qinling Mountains, Shaanxi Province, China. The network of reserves was established mainly for the conservation of the giant panda, a species considered as a surrogate for the conservation of many other endangered species in the region. The habitat suitability of nine protected species, including the giant panda, was modeled by using Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) and their spatial congruence was analyzed. Habitat suitability of these species was also overlapped with nature reserve boundaries and their management zones (i.e., core, buffer and experimental zones). Results show that in general the habitat of the giant panda constitutes a reasonable surrogate of the habitat of other protected species, and giant panda reserves protect a relatively high proportion of the habitat of other protected species. Therefore, giant panda habitat conservation also allows the conservation of the habitat of other protected species in the region. However, a large area of suitable habitat was excluded from the nature reserve network. In addition, four species exhibited a low proportion of highly suitable habitat inside the core zones of nature reserves. It suggests that a high proportion of suitable habitat of protected species not targeted for conservation is located in the experimental and buffer zones, thus, is being affected by human activities. To increase their conservation effectiveness, nature reserves and their management zones need to be re-examined in order to include suitable habitat of more endangered species. The procedures described in this study can be easily implemented for the conservation of many endangered species not only in China but in many other parts of the world. {\textcopyright} 2014 Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The management and protection of potentially vulnerable species and habitats require the availability of detailed spatial data. However, such data are often not readily available in particular areas that are challenging for sampling by traditional sampling techniques, for example seamounts. Within this study habitat modelling techniques were used to create predictive maps of six species of conservation concern for the Le Danois Bank (El Cachucho Marine Protected Area in the South of the Bay of Biscay). The study used data from ECOMARG multidisciplinary surveys that aimed to create a representative picture of the physical and biological composition of the area. Classical fishing gear (otter trawl and beam trawl) was used to sample benthic communities that inhabit sedimentary areas, and non-destructive visual sampling techniques (ROV and photogrammetric sled) were used to determine the presence of epibenthic macrofauna in complex and vulnerable habitats. Multibeam echosounder data, high-resolution seismic profiles (TOPAS system) and geological data from box-corer were used to characterize the benthic terrain. ArcGIS software was used to produce high-resolution maps (75×75m2) of such variables in the entire area. The Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) technique was used to process these data and create Habitat Suitability maps for six species of special conservation interest. The model used seven environmental variables (depth, rugosity, aspect, slope, Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) in fine and broad scale and morphosedimentary characteristics) to identify the most suitable habitats for such species and indicates which environmental factors determine their distribution. The six species models performed highly significantly better than random (p{\textless}0.0001; Mann-Whitney test) when Area Under the Curve (AUC) values were tested. This indicates that the environmental variables chosen are relevant to distinguish the distribution of these species. The Jackknife test estimated depth to be the key factor structuring their distribution, followed by the seabed morpho-sedimentary characteristics and rugosity variables. Three of the species studied (Asconema setubalense, Callogorgia verticillata and Helicolenus dactylopterus) were found to have small suitable areas as a result of being restrictive species related to the environmental characteristics of the top of the bank. The other species (Pheronema carpenteri, Phycis blennoides and Trachyscorpia cristulata), which were species less restrictive to the environmental variables used, had highly suitable areas of distribution. The study provides high-resolution maps of species that characterize the habitat of two communities included in OSPAR and NATURA networks, whose distributions corroborate the adequate protection of this area by the management measures applied at present. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The new release (ver. 3.4.0) will be hosted online by the American Museum of Natural History, along with future versions. It contains small functional changes, most notably use of a complementary log-log (cloglog) transform to produce an estimate of occurrence probability. The cloglog transform derives from the recently-published interpretation of Maxent as an inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP), giving it a stronger theoretical justification than the logistic transform which it replaces by default. In addition, the new R package, maxnet, fits Maxent models using the glmnet package for regularized generalized linear models. We discuss the implications of the IPP formulation in terms of model inputs and outputs, treating occurrence records as points rather than grid cells and interpreting the exponential Maxent model (raw output) as as an estimate of relative abundance. With these two open-source developments, we invite others to freely use and contribute to the software. {\textcopyright} 2017 Nordic Society Oikos.},

The number of recognized taxa in this group has long been debated and with this, the group has undergone several taxonomic changes. The species circumscription of H. serrata complex in China is inadequate and unresolved and is in need of comprehensive systematic studies. To address these issues, we have attempted to infer diagnostic differences between the putative taxa and circumscribe species boundary of H. serrata complex in China using an integrative multivariate approach. Morphological characters were subjected to multivariate tests (principal component analysis, discriminant analysis, $\chi$2-test, cluster analysis) followed by univariate analysis of variance and Tukey's post-hoc test. MaxEnt modeling was used to create distribution models of the species followed by niche equivalency and similarity tests. The morphometric analysis clearly separated the specimens into four distinct clusters representing H. crispata (Ching) Ching, H. nanlingensis Y. H. Yan {\&} N. Shrestha, and two clusters of H. serrata comprising specimens from geographically isolated regions. The recognition of these four distinct taxa was supported by climatic data as well. Based on our analysis of morphological with climatic data and ecological niche modeling we recognized H. crispata, H. nanlingensis, the northern Chinese H. serrata, and the southern Chinese H. serrata as four different species. We identified the northern Chinese H. serrata as true H. serrata and the southern Chinese taxa as H. javanica. Our results, however, did not support the recognition of other infraspecific taxa previously recognized under H. serrata. {\textcopyright} 2014 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

abstract = {To investigate the comparative abilities of six different bioclimatic models in an independent area, utilizing the distribution of eight different species available at a global scale and in Australia. Global scale and Australia. We tested a variety of bioclimatic models for eight different plant species employing five discriminatory correlative species distribution models (SDMs) including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), MaxEnt, Random Forest (RF), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Bioclim, together with CLIMEX (CL) as a mechanistic niche model. These models were fitted using a training dataset of available global data, but with the exclusion of Australian locations. The capabilities of these techniques in projecting suitable climate, based on independent records for these species in Australia, were compared. Thus, Australia is not used to calibrate the models and therefore it is as an independent area regarding geographic locations. To assess and compare performance, we utilized the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC), true skill statistic (TSS), and fractional predicted areas for all SDMs. In addition, we assessed satisfactory agreements between the outputs of the six different bioclimatic models, for all eight species in Australia. The modeling method impacted on potential distribution predictions under current climate. However, the utilization of sensitivity and the fractional predicted areas showed that GLM, MaxEnt, Bioclim, and CL had the highest sensitivity for Australian climate conditions. Bioclim calculated the highest fractional predicted area of an independent area, while RF and BRT were poor. For many applications, it is difficult to decide which bioclimatic model to use. This research shows that variable results are obtained using different SDMs in an independent area. This research also shows that the SDMs produce different results for different species; for example, Bioclim may not be good for one species but works better for other species. Also, when projecting a “large” number of species into novel environments or in an independent area, the selection of the “best” model/technique is often less reliable than an ensemble modeling approach. In addition, it is vital to understand the accuracy of SDMs' predictions. Further, while TSS, together with fractional predicted areas, are appropriate tools for the measurement of accuracy between model results, particularly when undertaking projections on an independent area, AUC has been proved not to be. Our study highlights that each one of these models (CL, Bioclim, GLM, MaxEnt, BRT, and RF) provides slightly different results on projections and that it may be safer to use an ensemble of models. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

abstract = {Climate change models predict that sites suitable for vineyards will shift over the next 50 years. In part through rootstocks and hybrid scions bred from North American Vitis species, cultivated grapevines can thrive in a variety of environments. However, relatively little is known about the range of climatic conditions under which natural populations of native North American Vitis species occur. In this study, we use geographic information system data to describe the climatic niches of 13 North American Vitis species that are distributed east of the Rocky Mountains and to compare climatic niches in a phylogenetic context. We extracted bioclimatic data from thousands of locality points and performed univariate and multivariate statistical analyses for each Vitis species. We then used these data to determine if phylogenetic relatedness was associated with similarities or differences in climatic niches. Finally, we performed Maxent modeling and multivariate environmental similarity surfaces analysis to identify suitable climate space for each species throughout the United States. Our results indicate Vitis species occur under a wide range of climatic conditions, including warm and wet (V. shuttleworthii), warm and dry (V. mustangensis), cold and wet (V. labrusca), and cold and dry (V. riparia) climates. Some clades within Vitis exhibit similarities in their climatic niches (niche conservatism), while others include species with notably different climatic niches (niche divergence). Additionally, we identify novel geographic locations where some species could potentially flourish. These data provide valuable insights into the abiotic environments occupied by natural populations of North American grapevines and may be useful in the development of rootstock genotypes to suit specific climates now and in the future. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the American Society for Enology and Viticulture.},

abstract = {Montane tropical rainforests are critically important areas for global bird diversity, but are projected to be highly vulnerable to contemporary climate change. Upslope shifts of lowland species may partially offset declines in upland species but also result in a process of lowland biotic attrition. This latter process is contingent on the absence of species adapted to novel warm climates, and isolation from pools of potential colonizers. In the Australian Wet Tropics, species distribution modelling has forecast critical declines in suitable environmental area for upland endemic birds, raising the question of the future role of both natural and assisted dispersal in species survival, but information is lacking for important neighbouring rainforest regions. Here we use expanded geographic coverage of data to model the realized distributions of 120 bird species found in north-eastern Australian rainforest, including species from potential source locations in the north and recipient locations in the south. We reaffirm previous conclusions as to the high vulnerability of this fauna to global warming, and extend the list of species whose suitable environmental area is projected to decrease. However, we find that expansion of suitable area for some species currently restricted to northern rainforests has the potential to offset biotic attrition in lowland forest of the Australian Wet Tropics. By examining contrasting dispersal scenarios, we show that responses to climate change in this region may critically depend on dispersal limitation, as climate change shifts the suitable environmental envelopes of many species south into currently unsuitable habitats. For lowland and northern species, future change in vegetation connectivity across contemporary habitat barriers is likely to be an important mediator of climate change impacts. In contrast, upland species are projected to become increasingly isolated and restricted. Their survival is likely to be more dependent on the viability of assisted migration, and the emergence and persistence of suitable environments at recipient locations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The results showed that the Maxent-modeled species' niches averaged together were a useful indicator of WNV human incidence in the state of Iowa.

abstract = {Much research has centered on determining which habitat model best predicts species occurrence. However, previous work typically used data sets that are inherently biased for evaluation. The use of simulated data provides a way of testing model performance using un-biased data where the true relationships between species occurrence and population processes are predefined using sound ecological theory. We used a process-based habitat model to generate simulated occurrence data to evaluate presence-absence and presence-only methods: generalized linear and generalized additive models (GLM, GAM), maximum entropy model (Maxent), and discrete choice models (DCM). This is the first study to use a DCM for predicting species distributions. We varied the effect that habitat quality had on fecundity and reported the model responses to these changes. When the effect of habitat quality on fecundity was weak, model performance was no better than random for all methods, however, performance increased as the habitat/fecundity relationship became stronger. For each level of habitat quality effect, there was little variation in performance between the presence-absence and presence-only methods. The use of a process-based habitat model to generate occurrence data for evaluating model performance has a distinct advantage over other testing methods, because no errors are made during sampling and the true ecological relationships between population process and species occurrence are known. This leads to un-biased results and increased confidence in assessing model performance and making management recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.},

abstract = {Species distribution modeling (SDM) is an important tool to assess the impact of global environmental change. Many species exhibit ecologically relevant intraspecific variation, and few studies have analyzed its relevance for SDM. Here, we compared three SDM techniques for the highly variable species Pinus contorta. First, applying a conventional SDM approach, we used MaxEnt to model the subject as a single species (species model), based on presence-absence observations. Second, we used MaxEnt to model each of the three most prevalent subspecies independently and combined their projected distributions (subspecies model). Finally, we used a universal growth transfer function (UTF), an approach to incorporate intraspecific variation utilizing provenance trial tree growth data. Different model approaches performed similarly when predicting current distributions. MaxEnt model discrimination was greater (AUC - species model: 0.94, subspecies model: 0.95, UTF: 0.89), but the UTF was better calibrated (slope and bias - species model: 1.31 and -0.58, subspecies model: 1.44 and -0.43, UTF: 1.01 and 0.04, respectively). Contrastingly, for future climatic conditions, projections of lodgepole pine habitat suitability diverged. In particular, when the species' intraspecific variability was acknowledged, the species was projected to better tolerate climatic change as related to suitable habitat without migration (subspecies model: 26{\%} habitat loss or UTF: 24{\%} habitat loss vs. species model: 60{\%} habitat loss), and given unlimited migration may increase amount of suitable habitat (subspecies model: 8{\%} habitat gain or UTF: 12{\%} habitat gain vs. species model: 51{\%} habitat loss) in the climatic period 2070-2100 (SRES A2 scenario, HADCM3). We conclude that models derived from within-species data produce different and better projections, and coincide with ecological theory. Furthermore, we conclude that intraspecific variation may buffer against adverse effects of climate change. A key future research challenge lies in assessing the extent to which species can utilize intraspecific variation under rapid environmental change. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

Winter precipitation and to a lesser degree summer precipitation and winter temperature were the climatic variables found to limit the regional distribution of E. delegorguei. The receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC) yielded an AUC (area under the curve) value of 0.995, indicating a reliable model, although interpretations must consider the influence of elevation for this insect. A testable hypothesis regarding future distribution of E. delegorguei in the face of climate change has been formulated for its winter range. Predator-prey relationships and food source also influence the occurrence of E. delegorguei and may override the influence of climate. The current distribution modelled identifies potential new sites in areas of similar climate which may be unknown to harvesters.

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used for extrapolation, or predicting suitable regions for species under new geographic or temporal scenarios. However, SDM predictions may be prone to errors if species are not at equilibrium with climatic conditions in the current range and if training samples are not representative. Here the controversial "Pleistocene rewilding" proposal was used as a novel example to address some of the challenges of extrapolating modeled species-climate relationships outside of current ranges. Climatic suitability for three proposed proxy species (Asian elephant, African cheetah and African lion) was extrapolated to the American southwest and Great Plains using Maxent, a machinelearning species distribution model. Similar models were fit for Oryx gazella, a species native to Africa that has naturalized in North America, to test model predictions. To overcome biases introduced by contracted modern ranges and limited occurrence data, random pseudo-presence points generated from modern and historical ranges were used for model training. For all species except the oryx, models of climatic suitability fit to training data from historical ranges produced larger areas of predicted suitability in North America than models fit to training data from modern ranges. Four naturalized oryx populations in the American southwest were correctly predicted with a generous model threshold, but none of these locations were predicted with a more stringent threshold. In general, the northern Great Plains had low climatic suitability for all focal species and scenarios considered, while portions of the southern Great Plains and American southwest had low to intermediate suitability for some species in some scenarios. The results suggest that the use of historical, in addition to modern, range information and randomly sampled pseudo-presence points may improve model accuracy. This has implications for modeling range shifts of organisms in response to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2010 Richmond et al.},

abstract = {How to effectively describe ecological patterns in nature over broader spatial scales and build a modeling ecological framework has become an important issue in ecological research. We test four modeling methods (MAXENT, DOMAIN, GLM and ANN) to predict the potential habitat of Schima superba (Chinese guger tree, CGT) with different spatial scale in the Huisun study area in Taiwan. Then we created three sampling design (from small to large scales) for model development and validation by different combinations of CGT samples from aforementioned three sites (Tong-Feng watershed, Yo-Shan Mountain, and Kuan-Dau watershed). These models combine points of known occurrence and topographic variables to infer CGT potential spatial distribution. Our assessment revealed that the method performance from highest to lowest was: MAXENT, DOMAIN, GLM and ANN on small spatial scale. The MAXENT and DOMAIN two models were the most capable for predicting the tree's potential habitat. However, the outcome clearly indicated that the models merely based on topographic variables performed poorly on large spatial extrapolation from Tong-Feng to Kuan-Dau because the humidity and sun illumination of the two watersheds are affected by their microterrains and are quite different from each other. Thus, the models developed from topographic variables can only be applied within a limited geographical extent without a significant error. Future studies will attempt to use variables involving spectral information associated with species extracted from high spatial, spectral resolution remotely sensed data, especially hyperspectral image data, for building a model so that it can be applied on a large spatial scale.},

abstract = {Researchers often encounter difficulties in obtaining timely and detailed information on urban growth. Modern remote-sensing techniques can address such difficulties. With desirable spectral resolution and temporal resolution, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products have significant advantages in tackling land-use and land-cover change issues at regional and global scales. However, simply based on spectral information, traditional methods of remote-sensing image classification are barely satisfactory. For example, it is quite difficult to distinguish urban and bare lands. Moreover, training samples of all land-cover types are needed, which means that traditional classification methods are inefficient in one-class classification. Even support vector machine, a current state-of-the-art method, still has several drawbacks. To address the aforementioned problems, this study proposes extracting urban land by combining MODIS surface reflectance, MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System data based on the maximum entropy model (MAXENT). This model has been proved successful in solving one-class problems in many other fields. But the application of MAXENT in remote sensing remains rare. A combination of NDVI and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System data can provide more information to facilitate the one-class classification of MODIS images. A multi-temporal case study of China in 2000, 2005, and 2010 shows that this novel method performs effectively. Several validations demonstrate that the urban land extraction results are comparable to classified Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) images. These results are also more reliable than those of MODIS land-cover type product (MCD12Q1). Thus, this study presents an innovative and practical method to extract urban land at large scale using multiple source data, which can be further applied to other periods and regions. {\textcopyright} 2014, {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are an important conservation tool. For marine predators, recent research has focused on the use of Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to identify proposed sites. We used a maximum entropy modelling approach based on static and dynamic oceanographic parameters to determine optimal feeding habitat for black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) at two colonies during two consecutive breeding seasons (2009 and 2010). A combination of Geographic Positioning System (GPS) loggers and Time-Depth Recorders (TDRs) attributed feeding activity to specific locations. Feeding areas were. {\textless}30. km from the colony, {\textless}40. km from land, in productive waters, 25-175. m deep. The predicted extent of optimal habitat declined at both colonies between 2009 and 2010 coincident with declines in reproductive success. Whilst the area of predicted optimal habitat changed, its location was spatially stable between years. There was a close match between observed feeding locations and habitat predicted as optimal at one colony (Lambay Island, Republic of Ireland), but a notable mismatch at the other (Rathlin Island, Northern Ireland). Designation of an MPA at Rathlin may, therefore, be less effective than a similar designation at Lambay perhaps due to the inherent variability in currents and sea state in the North Channel compared to the comparatively stable conditions in the central Irish Sea. Current strategies for designating MPAs do not accommodate likely future redistribution of resources due to climate change. We advocate the development of new approaches including dynamic MPAs that track changes in optimal habitat and non-colony specific ecosystem management. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

We modeled distributions of Alouatta caraya (196 presence localities, 8 bioclimatic variables) and A. guariba clamitans (74 presence localities, 13 bioclimatic variables) using bioclimatic variables from WorldClim with habitat suitability categorized as low, moderate, or high. Alouatta caraya showed a broader potential distribution, occupying a wide variety of habitats in a broad range of temperatures. Temperature annual range (Bio 7) was the bioclimatic variable with most influence in modeling the potential distribution of this species. Alouatta guariba clamitans was more restricted to rainy areas of mature forests at higher altitudes with low minimum temperatures. Mean temperature of coldest quarter (Bio 11) was the bioclimatic variable with the highest influence in this model. The predicted area of potential sympatry of both species was a relatively small area in the interior Atlantic Forest ecoregion, and a new syntopy locality occurred within the predicted area of sympatry. This narrow zone of overlap could be maintained, among other causes, by the role of the Paran{\'{a}} River as a natural barrier for dispersion, differences in niche requirements, potential interspecific competition, and hybridization. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {The management of invasive plant species (IPS) requires knowledge of areas susceptible to invasion and the origin of the invasive biotypes. Ecological niche models (ENMs) are useful for these purposes, but modeling results depend on the data sources. We propose a synthetic approach to determine the selection of data source areas considering the invasion status of an IPS and management objectives to deal with the IPS. We assessed the importance of data source for ENMs and their projections to invasive areas using Chromolaena odorata, a Neotropical weed, in South Africa where this IPS is invading. We used MaxEnt to perform ENMs using different datasets from C. odorata's native range and from South Africa. We employed reciprocal ENM projections to find the probable native region of the plants invading South Africa. ENMs varied depending on the native area selected as the hypothetical invasion source. The modeling approach using worldwide data was most appropriate for prevention purposes, whereas the modelling approach using data from the Americas was most suitable for estimating invasion-susceptible areas in South Africa. The South African ENM was useful for reciprocal modelling but not for prediction of areas susceptible to invasion. ENM projections from the Americas to South Africa and vice-versa identified two native areas as possible invasion sources (northern Mexico and southern tropical South America). Their concordance with the South African ENM can be useful to search for natural enemies of C. odorata's and to reinforce the identification of invasion-susceptible areas in South Africa. We suggest that the various ENM obtained with the synthetic approach in modeling with different data sources for C. odorata cover the scenarios that depend on management purpose and invasion status for this weed. {\textcopyright} 2016, Polish Academy of Sciences.

abstract = {Despite growing knowledge of fireenvironment linkages in the western USA, obtaining reliable estimates of relative wildfire likelihood remains a work in progress. The purpose of this study is to use updated fire observations during a 25-year period and a wide array of environmental variables in a statistical framework to produce high-resolution estimates of wildfire probability. Using the MaxEnt modelling technique, point-source fire observations that were sampled from area burned during the 19842008 time period were related to explanatory variables representing ignitions, flammable vegetation (i.e. fuels), climate and topography. Model results were used to produce spatially explicit predictions of wildfire probability. To assess the effect of humans on the spatial patterns of wildfire likelihood, we built an alternative model that excluded all variables having a strong anthropogenic imprint. Results showed that wildfire probability in the western USA is far from uniform, with different areas responding to different environmental drivers. The effect of anthropogenic factors on wildfire probability varied by region but, on the whole, humans appear to inhibit fire activity in the western USA. Our results not only provide what appear to be robust predictions of wildfire likelihood, but also enhance understanding of long-term controls on wildfire activity. In addition, our wildfire probability maps provide better information for strategic planning of land-management activities, especially where fire regime knowledge is sparse. {\textcopyright} IAWF 2012.},

The distribution of this biome is not well known in the country; accordingly, the goal of this paper is to delimit its distribution by using potential distribution models of species characteristic to the biome as surrogates. Based on herbarium specimens housed at the National Herbarium of Mexico, a database of 78 species restricted or mostly restricted to Humid Mountain Forest was constructed. In addition, 56 environmental covariates (26 climatic, nine soil properties, nine topographic attributes, and 14 remote sensing data) were assembled. Species modeling was done using MaxEnt. Twenty-three covari-ates defi ned the Humid Mountain Forest distribution in Mexico. Among these, normalized vegetation index for May, total annual precipitation, and organic carbon content in the soil were the most important. According to the models, Humid Mountain Forest in Mexico represents 7{\%} of the total surface of the country and it is found in 25 of the 32 states. Chiapas, Guerrero, Michoac{\'{a}}n, and Oaxaca are the most outstanding states since they collectively account for 74{\%} of the total Humid Mountain Forest surface.},

abstract = {The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus, native to South East Asia, is listed as one of the worst invasive vector species worldwide. In Europe the species is currently restricted to Southern Europe, but due to the ongoing climate change, Ae. albopictus is expected to expand its potential range further northwards. In addition to modelling the habitat suitability for Ae. albopictus under current and future climatic conditions in Europe by means of the maximum entropy approach, we here focused on the drivers of the habitat suitability prediction. We explored the most limiting factors for Aedes albopictus in Europe under current and future climatic conditions, a method which has been neglected in species distribution modelling so far. Ae. albopictus is one of the best-studied mosquito species, which allowed us to evaluate the applied Maxent approach for most limiting factor mapping. We identified three key limiting factors for Ae. albopictus in Europe under current climatic conditions: winter temperature in Eastern Europe, summer temperature in Southern Europe. Model findings were in good accordance with commonly known establishment thresholds in Europe based on climate chamber experiments and derived from the geographical distribution of the species. Under future climatic conditions low winter temperature were modelled to remain the most limiting factor in Eastern Europe, whereas in Central Europe annual mean temperature and summer temperatures were modelled to be replaced by summer precipitation, respectively, as most limiting factors. Changes in the climatic conditions in terms of the identified key limiting factors will be of great relevance regarding the invasive potential of the Ae. albopictus. Thus, our results may help to understand the key drivers of the suggested range expansion under climate change and may help to improve monitoring programmes. The applied approach of investigating limiting factors has proven to yield valuable results and may also provide valuable insights into the drivers of the prediction of current and future distribution of other species. This might be particularly interesting for other vector species that are of increasing public health concerns. {\textcopyright} 2016 Cunze et al.

Combining a total of 19 new Mesopotamian records with previous, reliable citations from the literature, a dataset of 45 points was used to model the potential distribution of the species, using the presence-only methods BIOCLIM and MAXENT. Models supported the existence of a distributional gap across the Semiarid Chaco. The imprecise literature record from "El Impenetrable", province of Chaco, is assigned to three tentative locations to evaluate if models are affected by their inclusion; in all cases, the disjunction was maintained. It was thereby estimated that the actual record might have originated in a site closer to the Humid Chaco and/or associated to streams. This paper also provides a statement of the bioclimatic profile and identification of major environmental constraints that define the range of G. orensis.

In this study, two different modeling methods (genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction [GARP] and maximum entropy species distribution modeling [Maxent]) were used to predict the potential distributions of these three fly species in China, by using distribution records and a set of environmental predictor variables. The results showed that Maxent performed well, compared with modeling by GARP, at each test threshold. For all three species, the results predicted by Maxent agreed with the observed distributions in Africa and in other parts of the world. In China, C. capitata seems to have the highest number of favorable habitat areas, relative to C. cosyra and C. rosa, i.e., Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan, Fujian, Sichuan and Chongqing, whereas C. cosyra has the smallest range of suitable areas, i.e., Yunnan, some parts of Hainan and Sichuan. The suitable areas for C. rosa are mainly restricted to Yunnan, Hainan, southern Guangdong, and a few areas of Sichuan. The indications are that on the whole, Southwest and South China are the areas with the highest risk for establishment from these three fly species. Jackknife tests reveal that environmental variables associated with temperature have the strongest influence on the potential distributions of all three species relative to other variables. {\textcopyright} 2009 Entomological Society of America.},

Chinese minnow (Rhynchocypris oxycephalus) is a small typical coldwater fish, which is endemic to East Asia and generally inhabits stream headwaters. Due to its occurrence in temperate south China, there is growing concern about its future fate in the face of global warming. In this study, we employed maximum entropy approach to analyze how distribution of this species would be impacted by future climate change. We collected data of 310 independent distribution points and 20 environmental variables, and conducted modeling under three general circulation models assuming two gas emission scenarios for 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. The results showed that the Min temperature of coldest month was the most important climatic variable for potential distribution of the Chinese minnow. Modeling predicted geographical distribution of the Chinese minnow would shrink over time and become much more limited in all the situations especially in South-eastern China, and there would be little suitable habitat left in this region by 2080s. Our results confirm that climate change clearly poses a severe threat to the Chinese minnow, and we suggest that conservation efforts should focus on lower temperature areas within the current range, because these areas will remain relatively cool and may be still suitable for the Chinese minnow even under the most drastic climate change scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Questions: Early bioclimatic models predict that climate change in southern African savannas will cause a huge southward and westward range shift of the savanna tree Colophospermum mopane (Kirk ex Benth.) Kirk ex J.L{\'{e}}on. C. mopane is an economically and ecologically important subtropical savanna tree that forms mono-dominant stands across 30{\%} of southern African savannas. We investigate the validity of these initial range expansion predictions to answer the following questions: what are the regional-scale drivers of the distribution of C. mopane in southern African savannas; and what are the landscape-scale distribution patterns of this species? Location: Central Lowveld, Kruger National Park, South Africa. Methods: We investigate the validity of very early range expansion modelling predictions using a regional-scale, climate envelope niche model, and fine-scale field mapping of the current boundary, to understand which environmental variables may determine the distribution limit of this signature species. Results: Our findings indicate that both non-climatic (dry season day length) and climatic (minimum temperatures) variables limit the regional distribution of C. mopane. At the landscape scale, the distribution of this species is restricted to the warmer parts of the landscape, suggesting minimum temperature appears to be the primary factor determining its landscape-scale distribution. Conclusions: This study provides the first detailed model of environmental factors that may limit the regional distribution of C. mopane, and allows us to formulate testable hypotheses regarding the determinants of the range of a keystone species. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

abstract = {Background: Anopheles albimanus is among the most important vectors of human malaria in Mesoamerica and the Caribbean Basin (M-C). Here, we use topographic data and 1950-2000 climate (near present), and future climate (2080) layers obtained from general circulation models (GCMs) to project the probability of the species' presence, p(s), using the species distribution model MaxEnt.Results: The projected near-present distribution parameterized with 314 presence points related well to the known geographic distribution in the study region. Different model experiments suggest that the range of An. albimanus based on near-present climate surfaces covered at least 1.27 million km 2 in the M-C, although 2080 range was projected to decrease to 1.19 million km 2. Modeled p(s) was generally highest in Mesoamerica where many of the original specimens were collected. MaxEnt projected near-present maximum elevation at 1,937 m whereas 2080 maximum elevation was projected at 2,118 m. 2080 climate scenarios generally showed increased p(s) in Mesoamerica, although results varied for northern South America and no major range expansion into the mid-latitudes was projected by 2080.Conclusions: MaxEnt experiments with near present and future climate data suggest that An. albimanus is likely to invade high-altitude ({\textgreater}2,000 m) areas by 2080 and therefore place many more people at risk of malaria in the M-C region even though latitudinal range expansion may be limited. {\textcopyright} 2012 Fuller et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Understanding the effects of climate change on primate ranging patterns is crucial for conservation planning. Rhinopithecus roxellana is an endangered primate species distributed in mountainous forests at the elevation of 1500-3500m a.s.l. in China. Our study site, the Shennongjia National Nature Reserve, represents the eastern-most distribution of this species. This area has experienced significant habitat loss and fragmentation because of human population growth, increased farming and logging, and climate change. To estimate how changes in temperature and rainfall will affect the presumed future distribution of this species, we examined eco-geographic factors including bioclimate, habitat (vegetation type, landcover, etc.), topography, and human impact (human population, gross domestic product, etc.), and provide suggestions for management and conservation. We used a maximum entropy approach to predict the location and distribution of habitats suitable for R. roxellana in the present, 2020, 2050, and 2080 based on 33 environmental parameters, three general circulation models, three emissions scenarios, and two dispersal hypotheses. According to the ensemble modeling, we found range reductions of almost 30{\%} by 2020, 70{\%} by 2050, and over 80{\%} by 2080. Although no obvious differences were found in distribution change based on full and zero dispersal assumptions, our results revealed range reductions in response to elevational, latitudinal, and longitudinal gradients, with the monkeys forced to migrate to higher elevations over time. Bioclimte factors, such as temperature, precipitation, evapo-transpiration, and aridity condition, were dominant contributors to range shifting. As habitat loss due to human influence and climate change is likely to be even more severe in the future, we considered three conservation hot-spots in the Shennongjia area and recommended: (i) securing existing reserves and establishing new reserves, (ii) re-designing management systems to include the Shenongjia reserve and the surrounding reserves and highlighting ecosystem protection at higher elevations, and (iii) using finer-scale research to guide the conservation planning and education in order to enhance protection and awareness in the local community. National and provincial conservation policies should integrate projections of climate change in making effective conservation strategies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

All variables were converted to a grid resolution of 0.0417 degrees. In both Maxent and GARP models the predicted geographical distribution of the species was larger than suggested by other observed data works, except for U. monilifera. According to the AUC criterion, the models generated by GARP were better than those obtained from Maxent. Evaluating the two models together, it is recommended conservation plans for species with restricted habitat (U. panaceae and U. monilifera) besides suggesting sampling of U. maracoani in the Brazilian northeast and U. uruguyaensis in the Brazilian southeast.},

Predicting potential geographic distribution of the species is important from species and habitat restoration point of view. This paper reports the results of a study carried out in the Lesser Himalayan foothills in India (Dun valley) on potential distribution modeling for Malabar nut using Maxent model. The Worldclim bioclimatic variables, slope, aspect, elevation, and the land use/land cover (based on IRS LISS-III) data and 46 spatially well-dispersed species occurrence points were used to predict the potential distribution of J. adhatoda in ca. 1877km2 study area. Jackknife test was used to evaluate the importance of the environmental variables for predictive modeling. Maxent model was highly accurate with a statistically significant AUC value of 92.3. The approach could be promising in predicting the potential distribution of medicinal plant species and thus, can be an effective tool in species restoration and conservation planning. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Gap analyses are efficient and reliable tools for prioritizing habitat conservation efforts, especially when considering endangered species. We propose a conservation plan for the brown–eared pheasant, Crossoptilon mantchuricum, by identifying protection gap areas based on 14 existing nature reserves. A total of 45 locality sites and 11 environmental variables were selected according to the characteristics of habitat use of the brown–eared pheasant and applied to a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model to obtain the species distribution. The MaxEnt model results showed a high prediction accuracy. The gap analysis results revealed that the Luliang Mountains in Shanxi and the Xiaowutai Mountains in Hebei had protection gaps. We found 458 km2 of optimum habitat and 1,390 km2 of moderately suitable habitat within the national nature reserve range. However, almost 1,861 km2 of the optimum habitat and 17,035 km2 of the moderately suitable habitat were unprotected, equivalent to 9.0{\%} and 82.1{\%}, respectively, of the total suitable habitat. Most of the unprotected area comprised moderately suitable habitat for brown–eared pheasant and should be prioritized in future conservation efforts. There are nine nature reserves along a north–to–south range in the Luliang Mountains that form a wildlife habitat corridor. To maintain the integrity, originality, and continuity of these habitats and thus protect brown–eared pheasants, local conservation departments should be strengthened to improve provincial nature reserve management and successfully carry out conservation efforts. {\textcopyright} 2016 Museu de Ci{\`{e}}ncies Naturals de Barcelona.},

It is very likely to occur in Brunei, although no explicit records have been traced. The pelage is typically brown or reddish-brown, with a few strongly reddish-orange individuals recorded in Sabah. It has never been studied in the field, so information on its ecology is limited. We used MaxEnt niche distribution modelling to predict the current distribution of collared mongoose in Borneo. We collected a total of 117 occurrence records from all regions, except Brunei and South Kalimantan. To reduce possible negative effects of uneven search-effort, 27 records were used in the Balanced Model and 77 in the Spatial Filtering Model to map habitat suitability. Our habitat suitability index model predicted that a large proportion of Borneo, mostly the lowland and upland forests in the interior encompassing large blocks of both national and transboundary protected area networks, is suitable for collared mongoose. Increased survey effort is warranted in areas predicted to be suitable but lack data, such as northern Central Kalimantan, central East Kalimantan, South Kalimantan and south-central Sarawak.

abstract = {Although migration is a widespread phenomenon across a range of taxa, the evolution of migratory behaviour remains insufficiently understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the relationships between migratory behaviour and life history traits of diurnal birds of prey (Accipitriformes) in a phylogenetic context and also to investigate the bioclimatic suitability of geographical ranges for migratory raptors. We performed phylogenetic generalized least square analysis, using a previously published phylogenetic tree of 179 accipitrid raptors, to identify relationships among distribution patterns, diet, hunting strategies, body measurements, clutch size, and migratory behaviour. Bioclimatic data were employed into computer learning maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) to specify differences between climatic conditions on breeding and wintering grounds. Clutch size and hunting strategies have been proved to be the most important variables in shaping distribution areas, and also the geographic dissimilarities may mask important relationships between life history traits and migratory behaviours. However, this result supports the need for distinctions among the three major migratory routes in raptors. Indeed, the West Palearctic-Afrotropical and the North-South American migratory systems are fundamentally different from the East Palearctic-Indomalayan system, owing to the presence versus absence of ecological barriers. This suggests that the migratory behaviours differ among the three main migratory routes for these species. Future studies could uncover the causes of differences among the three main flyways in more detail. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Linnean Society of London.},

Although the species occurs in protected areas in both countries, it is not known how well these areas protect the kodkod either currently or under climate change scenarios. We used species distribution models and spatial analyses to assess the distribution of the kodkod, examining the effects of changes in human land use and future climate change. We also assessed the species' present representation in protected areas and in light of climate change scenarios. We found that the kodkod has already lost 5.5{\%} of its range as a result of human land use, particularly in central areas of its distribution with intermediate habitat suitability. Climate change, together with human land use, will affect 40{\%} of the kodkod's present potential distribution by the year 2050. Currently, 12.5{\%} of the species' potential distribution lies in protected areas and this will increase to 14{\%} in the future. This increase does not, however, mean an increase in protected habitat but rather a reduction of the species' total potential range; a relatively larger percentage will be protected in Argentina than in Chile but the species is more susceptible to extinction in Argentina and the Chilean Matorral. {\textcopyright} 2014 Fauna and Flora International.},

abstract = {A geographic range is a heterogeneous matrix where the natural capability to support resident species varies from detrimental to optimal. Given this, the first priority for species conservation should be to determine where optimal environments exist. We used MaxEnt species distribution modeling to distinguish climatic characteristics associated with persistent leks from those at random locations in order to characterize the niche and potential distribution of the imperiled Lesser Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus). Annual, brood period, and winter precipitation were the most important characteristics of the niche across the entire range, but maximum temperature during nesting was a key characteristic in the southern part of the range. Habitat suitability across the geographic range was multimodal but also consistent with a center-periphery pattern. Western Kansas and Oklahoma and east-central New Mexico contributed more than expected, whereas all other areas contributed less than expected, to habitat suitability of the geographic range. Lesser Prairie-Chickens appear constrained on the western edge of their range by abiotic factors, namely aridity, unfavorable temperatures and sandy soils. Conversely, they appear constrained on the eastern edge by biotic factors, namely transition from mid-grass to tallgrass prairie that results in dominance by the Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido). Conserving Lesser Prairie- Chickens will depend on maintaining persistent populations in western Kansas and Oklahoma and eastcentral New Mexico, as well as expanding its distribution across Texas. Aridity, unfavorable temperatures, and a paucity of habitat make eastern Colorado and southeastern New Mexico challenging areas for persistence of this species. Climate change may make it more difficult for populations in New Mexico and adjacent parts of Texas to persist, but more favorable for populations in eastern Colorado. The potential difficulties for populations in the southern part of the range will make it increasingly important to conserve populations in western Kansas and Oklahoma. {\textcopyright} 2014 Dunn and Milne.},

In this study, we examined a sparsely distributed tree species, Kalopanax septemlobus (Araliaceae), which has been heavily disturbed by human use in temperate forests of South Korea. We used maximum entropy distribution modeling (MaxEnt) to identify the climatic and topographic factors driving the distribution of the species. Then, we constructed habitat models under current and projected climate conditions for the year 2050 and evaluated changes in the extent and connectivity of the K. septemlobus habitat. Annual mean temperature and terrain slope were the two most important predictors of species distribution. Our models predicted the range shift of K. septemlobus toward higher elevations under medium-low and high emissions scenarios for 2050, with dramatic reductions in suitable habitat (51{\%} and 85{\%}, respectively). In addition, connectivity analysis indicated that climate change is expected to reduce future levels of habitat connectivity. Even under the Representative Construction Pathway (RCP) 4.5 medium-low warming scenario, the projected climate conditions will decrease habitat connectivity by 78{\%}. Overall, suitable habitats for K. septemlobus populations will likely become more isolated depending on the severity of global warming. The approach presented here can be used to efficiently assess species and habitat vulnerability to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Background and AimsClimate change is expected to alter the geographic range of many plant species dramatically. Predicting this response will be critical to managing the conservation of plant resources and the effects of invasive species. The aim of this study was to predict the response of temperate homosporous ferns to climate change.MethodsGenetic diversity and changes in distribution range were inferred for the diploid rock fern Asplenium fontanum along a South-North transect, extending from its putative last glacial maximum (LGM) refugia in southern France towards southern Germany and eastern-central France. This study reconciles observations from distribution models and phylogeographic analyses derived from plastid and nuclear diversity.Key ResultsGenetic diversity distribution and niche modelling propose that genetic diversity accumulates in the LGM climate refugium in southern France with the formation of a diversity gradient reflecting a slow, post-LGM range expansion towards the current distribution range. Evidence supports the fern's preference for outcrossing, contradicting the expectation that homosporous ferns would populate new sites by single-spore colonization. Prediction of climate and distribution range change suggests that a dramatic loss of range and genetic diversity in this fern is possible. The observed migration is best described by the phalanx expansion model.ConclusionsThe results suggest that homosporous ferns reproducing preferentially by outcrossing accumulate genetic diversity primarily in LGM climate refugia and may be threatened if these areas disappear due to global climate change. {\textcopyright} 2013 {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

abstract = {The wood-boring bee Lithurgus huberi Ducke (Apidae: Megachilinae: Lithurgini) is arguably an exotic species to South America. This solitary bee is the only representative in the Western Hemisphere of the Old World genus Lithurgus, and likely a conspecific with the Indo-Australian species Lithurgus atratus. L. huberi appears to have reached the continent at least 100 years ago, when it was discovered and described. Because this species seems to be oligolectic on pollen of Convolvulaceae flowers in South America, we attempted to integrate this biotic interaction (plant-bee relationships) to our species distribution model (SDM) procedures to predict its potential distribution in South America. The modeled distribution of seven L. huberi's host plant species did not improve the algorithms' ability to predict its distribution, but it produced constrained ranges. These results suggest that our biotic variables are not independent of the abiotic variables used (mostly related to climate). We employed five modeling algorithms, Envelope Score, GARP, Mahalanobis Distance, Support Vector Machines, and MaxEnt, but only the former two showed a good performance when predicting the occurrence of both, the host plant species and L. huberi. Our results indicate that this exotic pollinator is mainly distributed in eastern, northeastern, central, and southwestern South America, with few suitable areas in the Amazon region. We also highlight suitable areas for future surveys and present new occurrence records. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Climate change affects both habitat suitability and the genetic diversity of wild plants. Therefore, predicting and establishing the most effective and coherent conservation areas is essential for the conservation of genetic diversity in response to climate change. This is because genetic variance is a product not only of habitat suitability in conservation areas but also of efficient protection and management. Phellodendron amurense Rupr. is a tree species (family Rutaceae) that is endangered due to excessive and illegal harvesting for use in Chinese medicine. Here, we test a general computational method for the prediction of priority conservation areas (PCAs) by measuring the genetic diversity of P. amurense across the entirety of northeast China using a single strand repeat analysis of twenty microsatellite markers. Using computational modeling, we evaluated the geographical distribution of the species, both now and in different future climate change scenarios. Different populations were analyzed according to genetic diversity, and PCAs were identified using a spatial conservation prioritization framework. These conservation areas were optimized to account for the geographical distribution of P. amurense both now and in the future, to effectively promote gene flow, and to have a long period of validity. In situ and ex situ conservation, strategies for vulnerable populations were proposed. Three populations with low genetic diversity are predicted to be negatively affected by climate change, making conservation of genetic diversity challenging due to decreasing habitat suitability. Habitat suitability was important for the assessment of genetic variability in existing nature reserves, which were found to be much smaller than the proposed PCAs. Finally, a simple set of conservation measures was established through modeling. This combined molecular and computational ecology approach provides a framework for planning the protection of species endangered by climate change. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {The development and implementation of a population supplementation and restoration plan for any endangered species should involve an understanding of the species' habitat requirements prior to the release of any captive bred individuals. The freshwater pearl mussel, Margaritifera margaritifera, has undergone dramatic declines over the last century and is now globally endangered. In Northern Ireland, the release of captive bred individuals is being used to support wild populations and repatriate the species in areas where it once existed. We employed a combination of maximum entropy modelling (MAXENT) and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to identify ecological parameters necessary to support wild populations using GIS-based landscape scale and ground-truthed habitat scale environmental parameters. The GIS-based landscape scale model suggested that mussel occurrence was associated with altitude and soil characteristics including the carbon, clay, sand, and silt content. Notably, mussels were associated with a relatively narrow band of variance indicating that M. margaritifera has a highly specific landscape niche. The ground-truthed habitat scale model suggested that mussel occurrence was associated with stable consolidated substrates, the extent of bankside trees, presence of indicative macrophyte species and fast flowing water. We propose a three phase conservation strategy for M. margaritifera identifying suitable areas within rivers that (i) have a high conservation value yet needing habitat restoration at a local level, (ii) sites for population supplementation of existing populations and (iii) sites for species reintroduction to rivers where the mussel historically occurred but is now locally extinct. A combined analytical approach including GIS-based landscape scale and ground-truthed habitat scale models provides a robust method by which suitable release sites can be identified for the population supplementation and restoration of an endangered species. Our results will be highly influential in the future management of M. margaritifera in Northern Ireland. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) inhabits the rugged mountains in 12 countries of Central Asia, including the Tibetan Plateau. Due to poaching, decreased abundance of prey, and habitat degradation, it was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 1972. Current conservation strategies, including nature reserves and incentive programs, have limited capacities to protect snow leopards. We investigated the role of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in snow leopard conservation in the Sanjiangyuan region in China's Qinghai Province on the Tibetan Plateau. From 2009 to 2011, we systematically surveyed snow leopards in the Sanjiangyuan region. We used the MaxEnt model to determine the relation of their presence to environmental variables (e.g., elevation, ruggedness) and to predict snow leopard distribution. Model results showed 89,602 km2 of snow leopard habitat in the Sanjiangyuan region, of which 7674 km2 lay within Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve's core zones. We analyzed the spatial relation between snow leopard habitat and Buddhist monasteries and found that 46{\%} of monasteries were located in snow leopard habitat and 90{\%} were within 5 km of snow leopard habitat. The 336 monasteries in the Sanjiangyuan region could protect more snow leopard habitat (8342 km2) through social norms and active patrols than the nature reserve's core zones. We conducted 144 household interviews to identify local herders' attitudes and behavior toward snow leopards and other wildlife. Most local herders claimed that they did not kill wildlife, and 42{\%} said they did not kill wildlife because it was a sin in Buddhism. Our results indicate monasteries play an important role in snow leopard conservation. Monastery-based snow leopard conservation could be extended to other Tibetan Buddhist regions that in total would encompass about 80{\%} of the global range of snow leopards. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.},

We investigated whether morphometric and ecological variation can provide additional criteria for species delimitation by combining geometric morphometrics and ecological niche modelling to characterize two near-sibling triatomine species, Triatoma sordida and Triatoma garciabesi (Reduviidae: Triatominae). We analysed size and shape variation in 231 wings and 123 heads from one T. garciabesi and three T. sordida populations. Predicted distribution maps (21 climatic variables, 324 vector occurrence points) were produced using the Maxent method. Multivariate analyses summarized morphological and ecological variation. Wings and heads of T. sordida were significantly larger and more elongated than those of T. garciabesi. Discriminant analyses separated the species, with a partial overlap between Argentinean populations. The predicted distribution of T. garciabesi included northwest Argentina (mainly arid Chaco), whereas that of T. sordida included northeast Argentina (humid Chaco) and the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga ecoregions. Clear ecological niche differences were observed, with T. garciabesi occupying colder and drier areas than T. sordida. Our results show how morphometric variation and niche divergence can be used to enhance operational criteria for the delimitation of phenotypically similar triatomine species. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {For conservation purposes, it is important to take into account the suitability of a species to particular habitats; this information may predict the long-term survival of a species. In this sense, morphological measures of developmental stress, such as fluctuating asymmetry, can be proxies for an individual's performance in different regions. In this study, we conducted tests to determine whether areas with different levels of suitability for a species (generated by ecological niche models) were congruent with morphological markers that reflect environmental stress and morphological variance. We generated a Maxent niche model and compared the suitability assessments of several areas with the skull morphology data (fluctuating asymmetry and morphological disparity) of populations of the Atlantic forest endemic to Brazil rodent Akodon cursor. Our analyses showed a significant negative relationship between suitability levels and fluctuating asymmetry levels, which indicates that in less suitable areas, the individuals experience numerous disturbances during skull ontogeny. We have not found an association between morphological variance and environmental suitability. As expected, these results suggest that in environments with a lower suitability, developmental stress is increased. Such information is helpful in the understanding of the species evolution and in the selection of priority areas for the conservation of species. {\textcopyright} 2015 Maestri et al.},

abstract = {Species distribution models are important tools to explore the effects of future global change on biodiversity. Specifically, AquaMaps, Maxent and the Sea Around Us Project algorithm are three approaches that have been applied to predict distributions of marine fishes and invertebrates. They were designed to cope with issues of data quality and quantity common in species distribution modelling, and especially pertinent to the marine environment. However, the characteristics of model projections for marine species from these different approaches have rarely been compared. Such comparisons provide information about the robustness and uncertainty of the projections, and are thus important for spatial planning and developing management and conservation strategies. Here we apply the three commonly used species distribution modelling methods for commercial fish in the North Sea and North Atlantic, with the aim of drawing comparisons between the approaches. The effect of different assumptions within each approach on the predicted current relative habitat suitability was assessed. Predicted current distributions were tested following data partitioning and selection of pseudoabsences from within a specified distance of occurrence data. As indicated by the test statistics, each modelling method produced plausible predictions of relative habitat suitability for each species, with subsequent incorporation of expert knowledge generally improving predictions. However, because of the differences between modelling algorithms, methodologies and patterns of relative suitability, comparing models using test statistics and selecting a 'best' model are not recommended. We propose that a multi-model approach should be preferred and a suite of possible predictions considered if biases due to uncertainty in data and model formulation are to be minimised. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Understanding how biodiversity will respond to climate change is a major challenge in conservation science. Climatic changes are likely to impose serious threats to many organisms, especially those with narrow distribution ranges, small populations and low dispersal capacity. Lion tamarins (Leontopithecus spp.) are endangered primates endemic to Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF), and all four living species are typical examples of these aggravating conditions. Here, we integrate ecological niche modeling and GIS-based information about BAF remnants and protected areas to estimate the exposure (i.e., the extent of climate change predicted to be experienced by a species) of current suitable habitats to climate change for 2050 and 2080, and to evaluate the efficacy of existing reserves to protect climatically suitable areas. Niche models were built using Maxent and then projected onto seven global circulation models derived from the A1B climatic scenario. According to our projections, the occurrence area of L. caissara will be little exposed to climate change. Western populations of L. chrysomelas could be potentially exposed, while climatically suitable habitats will be maintained only in part of the eastern region. Protected areas that presently harbor large populations of L. chrysopygus and L. rosalia will not retain climatic suitability by 2080. Monitoring trends of exposed populations and protecting areas predicted to hold suitable conditions should be prioritized. Given the potential exposure of key lion tamarin populations, we stress the importance of conducting additional studies to assess other aspects of their vulnerability (i.e., sensitivity to climate and adaptive capacity) and, therefore, to provide a more solid framework for future management decisions in the context of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Nine environmental predictor layers were prepared at 90 and 30 m resolution. A stepwise Maximum Entropy (Maxent) model was generated per endemic to achieve the most parsimonious result at an area under the curve {\textgreater} 0.8. Arctic-alpine elevation, edaphic barrens and low open-vegetation, individually or in pairs, were found to be predictive for endemics. Forty-eight endemics, 10 of which exclusive, were recorded and Maxent-predicted for the Majella massif. Subsets of 38 endemics were recorded on other mountains in proportion to their arctic-alpine area, thus conforming to the Island Theory. Maxent confirmed its strengths also at fine resolutions and, in addition, showed to be robust across predictor layers at both resolutions. A linear species-area relationship appeared superior to the Maxent model in predicting the number of endemics per arctic-alpine "island". Our findings suggest the need for a proactive management of the botanical biodiversity contained in the alpine and montane barrens and low-open vegetation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Aim: There is a wealth of information on species occurrences in biodiversity data banks, albeit presence-only, biased and scarce at fine resolutions. Moreover, fine-resolution species maps are required in biodiversity conservation. New techniques for dealing with this kind of data have been reported to perform well. These fine-resolution maps would be more robust if they could explain data at coarser resolutions at which species distributions are well represented. We present a new methodology for testing this hypothesis and apply it to invasive alien species (IAS). Location: Catalonia, Spain. Methods: We used species presence records from the Biodiversity data bank of Catalonia to model the distribution of ten IAS which, according to some recent studies, achieve their maximum distribution in the study area. To overcome problems inherent with the data, we prepared different correction treatments: three for dealing with bias and five for autocorrelation. We used the MaxEnt algorithm to generate models at 1-km resolution for each species and treatment. Acceptable models were upscaled to 10 km and validated against independent 10 km occurrence data. Results: Of a total of 150 models, 20 gave acceptable results at 1-km resolution and 12 passed the cross-scale validation test. No apparent pattern emerged, which could serve as a guide on modelling. Only four species gave models that also explained the distribution at the coarser scale. Main conclusions: Although some techniques may apparently deliver good distribution maps for species with scarce and biased data, they need to be taken with caution. When good independent data at a coarser scale are available, cross-scale validation can help to produce more reliable and robust maps. When no independent data are available for validation, however, new data gathering field surveys may be the only option if reliable fine-scale resolution maps are needed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Models predict 53,679-263,844 km2 of suitable habitat for H. maximiliani, with 8396-31,758 km2 inside protected areas. Besides being useful in a reassessment of the species' conservation status, our results contribute to the knowledge of distribution patterns of H. maximiliani and highlight potential areas to drive future field surveys. {\textcopyright} 2015 Chelonian Research Foundation.},

abstract = {The threats posed by invasive plants span ecosystems and economies worldwide. Local knowledge of biological invasions has proven beneficial for invasive species research, but to date no work has integrated this knowledge with species distribution modeling for invasion risk assessments. In this study, we integrated pastoral knowledge with Maxent modeling to assess the suitable habitat and potential impacts of invasive Cryptostegia grandiflora Robx. Ex R.Br. (rubber vine) in Ethiopia's Afar region. We conducted focus groups with seven villages across the Amibara and Awash-Fentale districts. Pastoral knowledge revealed the growing threat of rubber vine, which to date has received limited attention in Ethiopia, and whose presence in Afar was previously unknown to our team. Rubber vine occurrence points were collected in the field with pastoralists and processed in Maxent with MODIS-derived vegetation indices, topographic data, and anthropogenic variables. We tested model fit using a jackknife procedure and validated the final model with an independent occurrence data set collected through participatory mapping activities with pastoralists. A Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface analysis revealed areas with novel environmental conditions for future targeted surveys. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) and showed good fit across the jackknife models (average AUC = 0.80) and the final model (test AUC = 0.96). Our results reveal the growing threat rubber vine poses to Afar, with suitable habitat extending downstream of its current known location in the middle Awash River basin. Local pastoral knowledge provided important context for its rapid expansion due to acute changes in seasonality and habitat alteration, in addition to threats posed to numerous endemic tree species that provide critical provisioning ecosystem services. This work demonstrates the utility of integrating local ecological knowledge with species distribution modeling for early detection and targeted surveying of recently established invasive species. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the author(s).},

abstract = {We modeled current and future distribution of suitable habitat for the talus-obligate montane mammal Ochotona princeps (American pika) across the western USA under increases in temperature associated with contemporary climate change, to: a) compare forecasts using only climate variables vs using those plus habitat considerations; b) identify possible patterns of range collapse (center vs margins, and large- vs small-sized patches); and c) compare conservation and management implications of changes at two taxonomic resolutions, and using binned- vs binary-probability maps. We used MaxEnt to analyze relationships between occurrence records and climatic variables to develop a bioclimatic-envelope model, which we refined by masking with a deductive appropriate-habitat filter based on suitable land-cover types. We used this final species-distribution model to predict distribution of suitable habitat under range-wide temperature increases from 1 to 7°C, in 1°C increments; we also compared these results to distribution under IPCC-forecasted climates for 2050 and 2080. Though all currently recognized lineages and traditionally defined subspecies were predicted to lose increasing amounts of habitat as temperatures rose, the most-dramatic range losses were predicted to occur among traditional subspecies. Nineteen of the 31 traditional US pika subspecies were predicted to lose {\textgreater} 98{\%} of their suitable habitat under a 7°C increase in the mean temperature of the warmest quarter of the year, and lineages were predicted to lose 88 95{\%} of suitable habitat. Under a 4°C increase, traditional subspecies averaged a predicted 73{\%} (range = 44-99{\%}) reduction. The appropriate-habitat filter removed 40-6{\%} of the predicted climatically suitable pixels, in a stepped and monotonically decreasing fashion as predicted temperatures rose. Predicted range collapse proceeded until only populations in island-biogeographic 'mainlands' remained, which were not in the geographic range center. We used this model system to illustrate possible distributional shifts under stepped changes in biologically relevant aspects of climate, importance of land cover and taxonomic level in species-distribution forecasts, and impact of using a single threshold vs multiple categories of persistence probability in predicted range maps; we encourage additional research to further investigate the generality of these patterns. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Temperate forests of Chile exhibit high biodiversity, which generates a wide range of habitats for wildlife. These valuable natural ecosystems have been affected by major natural and anthropogenic processes that have reduced habitats, resulting in serious ecological problems, given both the high endemism of certain avian groups in these forests and the complexity of their habitat selection. Continued degradation and ecosystem problems could lead to the extinction of such groups. In spite of this possibility, ecologically valuable wildlife conservation is seldom integrated into forest management decision-making processes. This study aims to integrate wildlife into forest management, identifying potential habitats for two endemic birds of high ecological value, the Black throated Huet-Huet (Pteroptochos tarnii), and the Ochre-flanked Tapaculo (Eugralla paradoxa). Both species inhabit an ecotonal area between evergreen and sclerophyllous forests, making them high-quality bio-indicator species for the degree of conservation of temperate forest. The integration of environmental information and a geostatistical model based on the criterion of maximum entropy (Maxent model) identifies the most important variables that explain the presence of each species. Pteroptochos tarnii is less restrictive in its choice of habitat than Eugralla paradoxa, requiring merely certain topographical condition (elevation, ground slope and aspect). However Eugralla paradoxa requires not only the same topographical features, but also eco-geographical characteristics such as distance to trails, waterways and ecotones. Maxent analysis showed that for both species, the model most capable of predicting their choice of microhabitat was not random based, but rather one based on topographical and environmental variables. The integration of Maxent and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools could help to solve problems of wildlife habitat conservation and forest planning. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aim: The main aims of this study are: (1) to test if temperature and related parameters are the primary determinants of the regional distribution of macrofungi (as is commonly recognized for plants); (2) to test if the success of modelling fungal distribution patterns depends on species and distribution characteristics; and (3) to explore the potential of using herbarium data for modelling and predicting fungal species' distributions. Location: The study area, Norway, spans 58-71° N latitude and 4-32° E longitude, and embraces extensive ecological gradients in a small area. Methods: The study is based on 1020 herbarium collections of nine selected species of macrofungi and a set of 75 environmental predictor variables, all recorded in a 5 x 5-km grid covering Norway. Primarily, generalized linear model (GLM; logistic regression) analyses were used to identify the environmental variables that best accounted for the species' recorded distributions in Norway. Second, Maxent analyses (using variables identified by GLM) were used to produce predictive potential distribution maps for these species. Results: Variables relating to temperature and radiation were most frequently included in the GLMs, and between 24.8{\%} and 59.8{\%} of the variation in single-species occurrence was accounted for. The fraction of variation explained by the GLMs ranged from 41.6{\%} to 59.8{\%} for species with restricted distributions, and from 24.8{\%} to 39.3{\%} for species with widespread/scattered and intermediate distributions. The two-step procedure of GLM followed by Maxent gave predictions with very high values for the area under the curve (0.927-0.997), and maps of potential distribution were generally credible. Main conclusions: We show that temperature is a key factor governing the distribution of macrofungi in Norway, indicating that fungi may respond strongly to global warming. We confirm that modelling success depends partly on species and distribution characteristics, notably on how the distribution relates to the extent of the study area. Our study demonstrates that the combination of GLM and Maxent may be a fruitful approach for biogeography. We conclude that herbarium data improve insight into factors that control the distributions of fungi, of particular value for research on fleshy fungi (mushrooms), which have largely cryptic life cycles. {\textcopyright} 2008 University of Oslo.},

abstract = {Context. The grey mongoose, Herpestes ichneumon L., is a protected species in Spain. Populations of grey mongoose are currently increasing in numbers, and potential conflicts with human interests involving predation of small-game species, may arise in the near future. Aims. We predicted potential suitable areas for the expansion of grey mongoose by using a niche modelling approach to detect areas of conflict with small-game hunting activities. Methods. We compared these areas with regions in which small-game hunting is an important economic activity. To produce a niche-suitability map we used Maxent and an internal (data-splitting) validation to assess the predictive performance of the model. Areas in which small-game hunting is important were identified by using a rabbit-abundance index. Key results. On the basis of suitability modelling, populations of grey mongoose will expand into southern and central Spain. The variables with higher predictive power are mainly climatic, although some mosaic habitat types are also important. Internal validation reveals a strong correspondence between predicted and observed records. The overlap of high-suitability areas with areas assigned with a high rabbit-abundance index indicated the existence of large regions of potential conflict with hunting interests. Conclusions. Predictions of niche modelling can be used to detect conflict areas between expanding species and human interests. As a consequence of the expansion of the grey mongoose, the incidence of non-selective predator control may increase, thereby posing a threat to other protected predators. Implications. Identified areas of likely conflict should be prioritised to delineate careful management programs in terms of people education, surveying, incentives and the detection of illegal predator-control activities. {\textcopyright} 2010 CSIRO.},

abstract = {Recently the US Fish and Wildlife Service, as part of a critical habitat analysis for the northern spotted owl (. Strix occidentalis caurina), developed habitat suitability models based on thousands of owl nest sites distributed across 11 regions using the MaxEnt tool. Because these models formed the basis for critical habitat designations on millions of hectares of land, we undertook an independent evaluation of the FWS effort. We evaluated the accuracy of vegetation data used as input to develop the models, conducted out of sample analyses, correlated model output with owl reproductive success in two study areas, and developed alternate models using two different statistical methods. Vegetation data appeared accurate for only a few variables, and accuracy varied among model regions. Out of sample testing gave a high rate of classification errors and owl productivity was not correlated with MaxEnt model output in two study areas. Alternate statistical methods produced reasonable models with fewer variables. Critically, neither the models compared across regions nor the regions analyzed with different tools led to comparable use of variables. Thus biological interpretation of owl habitat selection models seemed ambiguous. In addition, for MaxEnt and one of the other tools, a highly significant trend by regression was found showing decreasing model accuracy as number of training nest sites increased. Together, these two results suggest that the generated models may be spurious to some unknown degree, perhaps because the underlying vegetation data, also derived from a model, are not sufficiently accurate to support the analysis and/or because the owls themselves affect habitat suitability by consuming their prey base. We suggest that the USFWS exercise caution in using MaxEnt models as a basis for regulatory purposes such as consultation, estimating likelihood of occupancy by owls, or evaluation of site-specific recovery actions. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Ecological niche models (ENMs) have multiple applications in ecology, evolution and conservation planning. They relate the known locations of a species to characteristics of its environment (usually climate) over its geographical range. Most ENMs are trained using standard 30-year (1961-1990) or 50-year (1951-2000) baselines to represent current climate conditions. Species occurrence records used as input to the models, however, are frequently collected from time periods that differ from those from which the climate is derived. Since climate variability can be significant within and outside baselines, and the distributions of some plants and animals (e.g., annual plants, insects) can adjust to environmental conditions on much shorter time scales, this mismatch between collection records and climatic baselines may affect the utility and accuracy of model outputs. We investigated how the choice of baseline periods influenced modelling efforts, anticipating that climate baselines derived from the same temporal period as the species records would yield improved ENMs. Ten simulated species' distributions were modelled using an ENM (Maxent) for (a) occurrences and climates within the same temporal period, based on eighteen 10-year baselines within the 20th century and (b) all available samples and climate baselines from 1951-2000 and 1961-1990. Each model was projected onto all the available 10-year climate scenarios and compared to the models trained on the corresponding scenario. We show that temporal mismatches of species occurrences and climate baselines can result in significantly poorer distribution models. Such temporal mismatch may be unavoidable for many studies, but we emphasize here the need to match the time range of samples and climate data whenever possible. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Niche conservation is not ubiquitous among all species or all environmental changes. Identifying the underlying basis for variable species responses is important for conservation efforts and macroevolutionary theory and requires comparing multiple clades and types of environmental change. To examine this issue, niche stability was analyzed for a phylogenetically diverse suite of invertebrates that inhabited the epicontinental seas of eastern North America during the Late Ordovician Period (∼450 Ma). These taxa experienced fluctuating sea level and a regional biotic invasion event, the Richmondian invasion, during nine time slices spanning approximately three million years. Niche models were generated with Maxent and niche stability was assessed via geographic overlap, niche similarity, and environmental parameters. These taxa exhibited high fidelity habitat tracking and stable ecological niches during the pre-invasion interval characterized by gradual sea-level changes, whereas taxa exhibited statistically lower niche stability and more niche evolution during and after the Richmondian invasion. Conversely, environmental parameter similarity between niche models of adjacent time slices was lowest during the pre-invasion interval and increased following the Richmondian invasion. Declining niche similarity and geographic stability coincident with increasing environmental parameter similarity indicates ecological niche change resulted from contracting species' realized niches to a subset of the original fundamental niche dimensions rather than shifting to new ecospace. Niche contraction is interpreted as a response to increased competition from invasive species, which may have arisen from adaptation, sorting (differential birth and death processes) and/or ecological fitting. These results indicate that consideration of multiple hierarchical levels, temporal scales and ecological contexts will yield new insights into the processes that generate both macroevolutionary and ecological patterns. They also suggest the widely employed assumption of niche conservatism through time and space may be more frequently valid for intervals of gradual abiotic change than for biotic changes caused by invasive species. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author.},

abstract = {Ecological niche modelling is a technique used to estimate potential distributions of invasive species based on available occurrence data and associated environmental conditions. Maximum entropy (Maxent) is a powerful method for ecological niche modelling and yet has only rarely been applied to aquatic species. Here we applied Maxent to estimate the potential distribution of the invasive Chinese mystery snail (Cipangopaludina chinesis) in Wisconsin and analysed several methodological issues associated with using Maxent for lentic species. To generate Maxent estimates of the potential distribution of C. chinesis, we used presence records from 292 lakes, five spatially explicit climatic variables, and two lake-specific environmental data sets (area, conductivity) from 7995 lakes. Our investigations included three aspects that could affect model prediction accuracy and transferability: (i) combining climate and lake variables into a single data set in two different ways, using each lake as a single observation and as a grid of 1 ha cells; (ii) varying the size of the background data set (locations without presences); and (iii) contrasting environmental conditions between locations with and without C. chinesis. The lake-based model had higher accuracy than the grid-based model, although both models had accuracy values indicative of good performance. Conductivity and lake area were important predictor variables for both models, but had higher contribution to the lake-based model accuracy. Decreasing the background sample size minimally affected model accuracy and thus Maxent can be used even when background sampling does not meet the algorithm's default settings. Lastly, lakes that were environmentally dissimilar from lakes with known C. chinesis records were more likely to be predicted unsuitable by both grid-based and lake-based models. Overall, the models predicted high potential suitability across Wisconsin lakes for C. chinesis, especially in lakes ≥60 ha. Our study provides evidence that small or environmentally biased presence data sets may underestimate the number of environmentally suitable locations of invasive species. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Previous research has shown that the production of Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica), the main source of high-quality coffee, will be severely affected by climate change. Since large numbers of smallholder farmers in tropical mountain regions depend on this crop as their main source of income, the repercussions on farmer livelihoods could be substantial. Past studies of the issue have largely focused on Latin America, while the vulnerability of Southeast Asian coffee farmers to climate change has received very little attention. We present results of a modeling study of climate change impacts on Arabica coffee in Indonesia, one of the world's largest coffee producers. Focusing on the country's main Arabica production zones in Sumatra, Sulawesi, Flores, Bali and Java, we show that there are currently extensive areas with a suitable climate for Arabica coffee production outside the present production zones. Temperature increases are likely to combine with decreasing rainfall on some islands and increasing rainfall on others. These changes are projected to drastically reduce the total area of climatically suitable coffee-producing land across Indonesia by 2050. However, even then there will remain more land area with a suitable climate and topography for coffee cultivation outside protected areas available than is being used for coffee production now, although much of this area will not be in the same locations. This suggests that local production decline could at least partly be compensated by expansion into other areas. This may allow the country to maintain current production levels while those of other major producer countries decline. However, this forced adaptation process could become a major driver of deforestation in the highlands. We highlight the need for public and private policies to encourage the expansion of coffee farms into areas that will remain suitable over the medium term, that are not under legal protection, and that are already deforested so that coffee farming could make a positive contribution to landscape restoration. {\textcopyright} 2014, The Author(s).},

abstract = {Across North America, grassland songbirds have undergone steep population declines over recent decades, commonly attributed to agricultural intensification. Understanding the potential interactions between the impacts of climate change on the future distributions of these species and the availability of suitable vegetation for nesting can support improved risk assessments and conservation planning for this group of species. We used North American bioclimatic niche models to examine future changes in suitable breeding climate for 15 grassland songbird species at their current northern range limits along the boreal forest–prairie ecotone in Alberta, Canada. Our climate suitability projections, combined with the current distribution of native and tame pasture and cropland in Alberta, suggest that some climate-mediated range expansion of grassland songbirds in Alberta is possible. For six of the eight species projected to experience expansions of suitable climate area in Alberta, this suitable climate partly overlaps the current distribution of suitable land cover. Additionally, for more than half of the species examined, most of the area of currently suitable climate was projected to remain suitable to the end of the century, highlighting the importance of Alberta for the long-term persistence of these species. Some northern prairie-endemic species exhibited substantial projected northward shifts of both the northern and southern edges of the area of suitable climate. Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii) and Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii), both at-risk grassland specialists, are predicted to have limited climate stability within their current ranges, and their expansion into new areas of suitable climate may be limited by the availability of suitable land cover. Our results highlight the importance of the preservation and restoration of remaining suitable grassland habitat within areas of projected climate stability and beyond current northern range limits for the long-term persistence of many grassland songbird species in the face of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the author(s).},

abstract = {Understanding species spatial occurrence patterns and their environmental dependence is one of the fundamental goals in ecology and evolution. Often, occurrence models are built with presence-only data because absence data are unavailable. We compare the strengths and limitations of the recently developed presence-only modelling method, Maxlike, with the more widely used Maxent. In spite of disparities highlighted by the developers of Maxlike and Maxent, we show approximate formal relationships between the parameters of Maxlike and Maxent for two scenarios to illustrate their similarity. Using case studies based on real and simulated data, we show how these similarities manifest in practice. We find more similarities than differences between Maxlike and Maxent, including coefficient values, predicted spatial distributions, similarity to presence-absence models, predictive performance and ranking the predicted suitability of cells. Maxlike reliably predicted absolute occurrence probabilities for very large data sets on landscapes where occurrence probability approximately spanned [0,1]. For smaller data sets, the uncertainty in predicted occurrence probability by Maxlike was very large, due to the inherent limitations of presence-only data. In contrast, Maxent is constrained to predicting relative occurrence probabilities or relative occurrence rates unless it is provided with additional information from presence-absence data. Both models can reliably predict relative differences in occurrence probability. The choice of which model to use depends partly on sampling assumptions, which we discuss in detail. Due to limitations of presence-only data, ecologists should typically focus on interpretations relying on relative differences in occurrence probability or relative occurrence rates. We discuss how to remedy a number of concerns about the use of Maxent and how to avoid some potential pitfalls with Maxlike - particularly related to high variance predictions. We conclude that both methods are similarly valuable for understanding and predicting species' distributions in terms of relative differences in occurrence probability when the models are specified carefully. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

However, the frequently scarce and incomplete data owing to the sensitive nature of illegal activities pose a challenge to developing tools to properly understand and prevent those activities. 2.We used species distribution models to identify factors related to a prominent illegal activity, wildlife poisoning, and to produce detailed, spatially explicit maps of the risk of occurrence in NW Spain. We alleviated the constraints of imperfect information and occurrence of absences by using presence-only methods, that is, maximum entropy modelling (MaxEnt). To our knowledge, this is the first time that this method has been used in the context of illegal activities affecting wildlife. 3.A total of 112 poisoning events involving 228 individuals of 25 different species were reported in the study area from 2000 to 2010. Most of the reported deaths (90{\textperiodcentered}8{\%}) were birds of prey (52{\textperiodcentered}6{\%}) and mammalian carnivores (38{\textperiodcentered}2{\%}), of which 95{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} were scavengers. Illegal poisoning affected eleven species classified as endangered at national and/or global level. 4.Our models highlighted the perceived risk of livestock predation by wolves Canis lupus, although not by bears Ursus arctos, as a major motivation for poisoning. The existence of protected areas was positively correlated to this illegal practice, while socioeconomic factors had less influence on predicting its occurrence. Over 56{\%} of the study area was predicted to be under risk of illegal poisoning. 5.Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate a new use for presence-only models, illustrated using MaxEnt, to assist conservation managers dealing with illegal activities. This approach allows the main causes of an illegal practice to be identified and generates spatially explicit risk maps. Managers can take advantage of this modelling approach to allocate the scarce resources available in conservation to key sectors and locations. In our study system, actions against illegal poisoning should aim to resolve the potential conflict existing between cattle-farming and wolves, especially in protected areas. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

We first introduce a stochastic measure of anisotropy, which is defined using metrics in the set of elasticity tensors and used for quantitatively characterizing the fulfillment of material symmetry constraints. After having defined a numerical approximation for the stochastic boundedness constraint, we then propose a methodology allowing one to unify maximum entropy based models that have been previously derived by considering some of these constraints and which consists in constructing a probabilistic model for an auxiliary random variable. The latter can be interpreted as a stochastic compliance tensor, for which the available information to be used in the maximum entropy formulation can be readily deduced from the one considered for the elasticity tensor. A numerical illustration of the approach to an elastic microstructure is finally provided. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Most modelling exercises use generic occurrence points of a species, but the distribution of habitats used for different purposes may differ. Modelling separately the availability of functionally different habitats may allow for the identification of the habitats mostly affecting/limiting distribution, with important implications for conservation. We analyzed the regional distribution of the black woodpecker in Northern Italy. We separately modelled the availability of feeding and nesting habitats at the fine scale (20. m. ×. 20. m), and compared the outputs with a more conventional distribution modelling procedure, which included all records and was developed at the territory scale (1. km. ×. 1. km). Both the conventional and feeding habitat models performed well (although they tended to under- and overestimate occurrence, respectively), whereas the nesting habitat model had a lower discriminatory ability. Nesting and feeding habitats show different relationships between woodpecker occurrence and habitat variables, this resulting in a weak overlap of the respective niches and in quite different distributions. The conventional model provided less information for management, being mainly affected by elevation and urbanized areas; the two specific models instead showed effects of habitat variables on occurrence of feeding and nesting sites. The availability of feeding habitat is likely the most important factor limiting distribution in the area and could be the focus of possible habitat management, which should include the preservation of grassland patches interspersed within woodlands, especially on South-facing, gently sloping mountainsides. Modelling separately the availability of functionally different habitats may provide useful information for conservation and management. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim: Populations of several sea star species were devastated by a disease in 2013–2014 from Alaska to Baja California. However, their exact distributions and ecological requirements are unknown and better knowledge could help identify populations that are at risk. This study aimed to assess patterns of distribution and determine ecological requirements of several sea star species affected by the disease. Location: Continental shelf from southern Washington State to northern California, USA. Methods: A large occurrence dataset (5385 data points) of 11 taxa was gathered from bottom trawl surveys and underwater video footage, along with data for 13 oceanographic and seafloor environmental parameters. Species distribution modelling (Maxent) and ecological niche (outlying mean index) analyses were applied to these biotic and abiotic datasets. Results: Each species showed contrasting ecological niches and modelled distributions, the main explanatory factors being depth, temperature, salinity, sediment mean grain size and the presence of rocky outcrops. Despite these species being recorded from Alaska to California, some sea stars showed very narrow distributions, whereas other taxa were widely distributed in the whole area. Main conclusions: The modelled ecological niches and distributions of these 11 sea star taxa showed a high degree of differentiation. Because intertidal and shallow subtidal populations were drastically affected by the 2013–2014 disease, recovery will depend on health of subtidal populations and the ability of the species to disperse and recolonize shallower areas. Our study will serve as a useful reference of the species distributions before the disease started. This distributional data and assessment of influential environmental factors will be valuable for future predictions or studies of the effects of bottom-contact ocean-use activities on sea star species as well as the effects of climate change. Understanding habitat conditions favourable for these species may be helpful in managing population recovery following disease outbreaks or other catastrophic events. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

However, the lack of consideration for many different aspects of the species' ecology often result in maps of limited practical value. Yet the wealth of information that is often available especially for larger vertebrates could help improve these models. Here, considering the mouflon Ovis aries in Sardinia as a case study, we propose a new integrated approach based on different aspects of the species ecology. In particular, we combined an SDM calibrated with an ensemble modelling approach with a morphological spatial pattern analysis and a model of structural connectivity. With this approach it was possible to map at the same time the distribution of potentially suitable habitat patches and particularly of those being able to host a pregnant females and of the structural corridors connecting these patches. Overall, while the SDM predicted that 14.5{\%} 3480 km2 of Sardinia was suitable for the presence of the mouflon, with our new integrated approach the percentage of areas suitable dropped to a much lower and more realistic 6.6{\%} 1584 km2 .Our results have potentially important consequences for the practical conservation and management of the species in Sardinia. {\textcopyright} 2016 Associazione Teriologica Italiana.},

Outside of urban areas, temperate termite ecology is largely unknown, particularly when compared to tropical termites and other temperate organisms in the functional guild of wood-decomposing animals. 2. This review combines climate habitat modelling with knowledge of species physiology, behaviour, and community interactions to identify and prioritise future research on temperate termite ecology and biogeography. 3. Using a correlative climate model, the regional distributions of three common temperate forest termite species are shown to correlate with different aspects of climate (e.g. mean versus minimum monthly temperature), but that overall their distributions within temperate systems correlate more strongly with temperature variables than with precipitation variables. 4. Existing data are synthesised to outline how the subterranean, wood-nesting behaviour of most temperate forest termite species links their activity to an additional set of non-climate controls: wood type and tree species, soil depth, fungal activity, ant abundances and phenology, and competitive asymmetries among termite species. 5. Although fine-scale estimates of temperate termite abundances are rare, we provide upper bounds on their ecosystem impacts and illustrate how their regional abundances may influence forest structure and habitat availability for other organisms. 6. This review highlights that rigorous ecological studies in non-urban, intact ecosystems - with a particular focus on community interactions - are critically needed to accurately project future abundances, economic impacts, and ecosystem effects of temperate forest termites. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.},

Information on the bush dog, however, has been lacking since standard field techniques have had little or no success with this species. The S. venaticus Status and Distribution Survey was developed in an attempt to use indirect methodologies to determine the bush dog's conservation status in the wild, its current distribution, and identify ecological needs by correlating habitat types to bush dog sightings. Survey responses and literature generated a database with 399 historic bush dog locations recorded between 1834 and 2004. These locational records were used to update the species' range extent map, an important conservation planning tool. With year and precision of data accounted for, we analyzed land use coverage at known locations where bush dogs have historically been reported to evaluate the likelihood that the species persists in the area today. In addition, these locations provided training data for generation of potential distribution maps (i.e., areas of occupancy) using ecological niche modeling (i.e., Maximum Entropy) and bioclimatic data. These analyses revealed that 20{\%} of the historic bush dog locations are associated with fragmented or altered habitat.

abstract = {The green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), which is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from Baja California to the Bering Sea, tends to be highly migratory, moving long distances among estuaries, spawning rivers, and distant coastal regions. Factors that determine the oceanic distribution of green sturgeon are unclear, but broad-scale physical conditions interacting with migration behavior may play an important role. We estimated the distribution of green sturgeon by modeling species-environment relationships using oceanographic and migration behavior covariates with maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) of species geographic distributions. The primary concentration of green sturgeon was estimated from approximately 41-51.5° N latitude in the coastal waters of Washington, Oregon, and Vancouver Island and in the vicinity of San Francisco and Monterey Bays from 36-37° N latitude. Unsuitably cold water temperatures in the far north and energetic efficiencies associated with prevailing water currents may provide the best explanation for the range-wide marine distribution of green sturgeon. Independent trawl records, fisheries observer records, and tagging studies corroborated our findings. However, our model also delineated patchily distributed habitat south of Monterey Bay, though there are few records of green sturgeon from this region. Green sturgeon are likely influenced by countervailing pressures governing their dispersal. They are behaviorally directed to revisit natal freshwater spawning rivers and persistent overwintering grounds in coastal marine habitats, yet they are likely physiologically bounded by abiotic and biotic environmental features. Impacts of human activities on green sturgeon or their habitat in coastal waters, such as bottom-disturbing trawl fisheries, may be minimized through marine spatial planning that makes use of high-quality species distribution information.},

abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) is a projected consequence of global climate change that will result in complex changes in coastal ecosystems. These changes will cause transitions among coastal habitat types, which will be compounded by human-made barriers to the gradual inland migration of these habitat types. The effect of these changes on the future viability of coastal species will depend on the habitat requirements and population dynamics of these species. Thus, realistic assessments of the impact of SLR require linking geomorphological models with habitat and population models. In this study, we implemented a framework that allows this linkage, and demonstrated its feasibility to assess the effect of SLR on the viability of the Snowy Plover population in Florida. The results indicate that SLR will cause a decline in suitable habitat and carrying capacity for this species, and an increase in the risk of its extinction and decline. The model projected that the population size will decline faster than the area of habitat or carrying capacity, demonstrating the necessity of incorporating population dynamics in assessing the impacts of SLR on coastal species. The results were most sensitive to uncertainties in survival rate and fecundity, and suggested that future studies on this species should focus on the average and variability of these demographic rates and their dependence on population density. The effect of SLR on this species' viability was qualitatively similar with most alternative models that used the extreme values of each uncertain parameter, indicating that the results are robust to uncertainties in the model.

abstract = {Species distribution modelling can be applied to identify potentially suitable habitat for species with largely unknown distributions, such as many deep-water corals. Important variables influencing species occurrence in the deep sea, e.g. substrate composition, are often not included in these modelling approaches because high-resolution data are unavailable. We investigated the relationship between substrate composition and the occurrence of the two deep-water octocoral species Primnoa resedaeformis and Paragorgia arborea, which require hard substrate for attachment. On a scale of 10s of metres, we analysed images of the seafloor taken at two locations inside the Northeast Channel Coral Conservation Area in the Northwest Atlantic. We interpolated substrate composition over the sampling areas and determined the contribution of substrate classes, depth and slope to describe habitat suitability using maximum entropy modelling (Maxent). Substrate composition was similar at both sites - dominated by pebbles in a matrix of sand ({\textgreater}80{\%}) with low percentages of suitable substrate for coral occurrence. Coral abundance was low at site 1 (0.9 colonies of P. resedaeformis per 100 m2) and high at site 2 (63 colonies of P. resedaeformis per 100 m2) indicating that substrate alone is not sufficient to explain varying patterns in coral occurrence. Spatial interpolations of substrate classes revealed the difficulty to accurately resolve sparsely distributed boulders (3–5{\%} of substrate). Boulders were by far the most important variable in the habitat suitability model (HSM) for P. resedaeformis at site 1, indicating the fundamental influence of a substrate class that is the least abundant. At site 2, HSMs identified cobbles and sand/pebble as the most important variables for habitat suitability. However, substrate classes were correlated making it difficult to determine the influence of individual variables. To provide accurate information on habitat suitability for the two coral species, substrate composition needs to be quantified so that small fractions ({\textless}20{\%} contribution of certain substrate class) of suitable substrate are resolved. While the collection and analysis of high-resolution data is costly and spatially limited, the required resolution is unlikely to be achieved in coarse-scale interpolations of substrate data. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Little is known about the species, but it is threatened as a result of overharvesting. We integrated field survey results with climate and altitude data to predict the geographic distribution of this species using the niche modeling program Maxent, and we validated these predictions by using interviews with local residents to confirm model predictions of presence and absence. The results of the validated Maxent models were then used to characterize the environmental conditions of areas predicted suitable for L. laoensis. Finally, we overlaid the resulting model with a map of current national protected areas in Laos to determine whether or not any land predicted to be suitable for this species is coincident with a national protected area. We found that both area under the curve (AUC) values and interview data provided strong support for the predictive power of these models, and we suggest that interview data could be used more widely in species distribution niche modeling. Our results further indicated that this species is mostly likely geographically restricted to high altitude regions (i.e., over 1,000 m elevation) in northern Laos and that only a minute fraction of suitable habitat is currently protected. This work thus emphasizes that increased protection efforts, including listing this species as endangered and the establishment of protected areas in the region predicted to be suitable for L. laoensis, are urgently needed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Chunco et al.},

Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to predict the likely changes in the distribution of species in future climate change scenarios. The aim of the present study is to predict the effect of climate change on a valuable threatened tree species Dysoxylum binectariferum in the northeastern part of Bangladesh using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model on species' occurrence data. The future distribution of D. binectariferum was predicted under two scenarios from the IPCC 5th assessment (RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5) in 2050 and 2070. Model results showed that approximately 32{\%} (2177 km2) of the studied area is currently suitable for this species to grow. However, future predictions obtained by the model projected a complete loss of suitable habitat for D. binectariferum in the studied area by both 2050 and 2070. Therefore, urgent measures are required for the conservation of D. binectariferum in northeastern Bangladesh. The application of species distribution models to simple inventory data (such as the occurrence of the species) may provide policymakers and conservationists with a useful tool for the prediction of future distribution (at both local and regional scales) of poorly known species with high preservation concerns. {\textcopyright} SISEF.},

The goal of our study was to assess the influence of future climate scenarios on the extent and geographic location of climatically suitable areas for Reeves's pheasant Syrmaticus reevesii, a species endemic to China, using geographic information systems and ecological niche modeling techniques. We compared model prediction under present climate with the species' historical range and land-cover data, both of which enable a plausible assessment of present-day climatically suitable areas for the species. The areas predicted suitable under future climates showed differences among emission scenarios, but several common trends emerged. Specifically, our results indicated that future climatically suitable area for S. reevesii would decrease and shift to higher altitudes, and the geographic centroids of the climatically suitable areas would mainly move northwest. Additionally, we assessed future changes of climatically suitable areas in the nature reserves where S. reevesii is known to occur, and provided suggestions for conserving the species under climate change scenarios. {\textcopyright} The authors 2015.},

In this work, we analyzed the geographic and potential distribution of a poorly known species of South American bat. As a tool, environmental niche modeling has been used to study the distributional patterns of species and more recently, taxonomic boundaries of cryptic species. We used MaxEnt v 3.3.e, Worldclim database and a vegetation map, covering the entire area of species' occurrence. We registered 64 localities from Argentina (43), Chile (10), Peru (8) and Bolivia (5). We divided recording localities in different datasets according to several taxonomic schemes, and analyzed potential distribution models separately (i.e., all known records; Argentina-Chile; Peru) in five different models. Models including all known localities showed a disjoint distribution, with two basic core areas of high predictive values, one in NW Argentina and another in southern Chile and SW Argentina separated by the South American Arid Diagonal. A third area appeared in Atacama and Sechura deserts in the models that included Peruvian and Bolivian localities. Model including only Peruvian localities showed the opposite pattern, with high predictive values only in arid environments from southern Peru. We interpreted that localities correctly assigned to H. macrotus belong to a taxonomic complex distributed in two contrasting areas, each one inhabited by a different taxon: 1) Bolivia and NW Argentina and 2) S and central Chile and SW Argentina. Given the systematic uncertainty of Histiotus, these two forms might be sister species or may not share an immediate common ancestor within the genus. Further, we consider that the specimens from localities referred to H. macrotus from southern Peru should be revised. These alternatives await a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis of Histiotus. {\textcopyright} Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.},

abstract = {Although predictions of potential distributions of invasive species often assume niche conservatism, recent analyses suggest that niche shifts can also occur. Thus, further studies are necessary to provide a better understanding of niche dynamics and to predict geographic distribution in invaded areas. The present study investigated the niche shift hypothesis at a broad biogeographical scale, using the comprehensive distribution of the invasive species Zaprionus indianus in its native (Africa) and invaded (America and India) ranges. Z. indianus is a very successful invasive species that presents high adaptive flexibility and extreme physiological tolerance. To investigate whether Z. indianus changed its climatic niche from Africa to America and India, multivariate analyses, as well as ecological niche modeling procedures (GARP, MAXENT and Mahalanobis distances), were used. Multivariate analyses showed that the niche spaces of Z. indianus in Africa, India and the Americas were significantly different (Wilks' $\lambda$ from a Multivariate Analysis of Variance, MANOVA = 0. 115; P {\textless} 0.0001). Out of 108 occurrences in America, only 11 (ca 10{\%}) were classified, by Canonical Variate Analysis scores, as belonging to its original range in Africa, whereas only 5{\%} of the 39 occurrences in India were classified as belonging to Z. indianus' original range. Consensus results from MAXENT, GARP and Mahalanobis distances correctly predicted only 27{\%} of the occurrences in India and 85{\%} of occurrences in America. Thus, all analyses showed that Zaprionus indianus quickly expanded ranges into different environments in the invaded areas, suggesting climatic niche shifts, primarily in India. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract = {A major obstacle in prioritizing species or habitats for conservation is the degree of unrecognized diversity hidden within complexes of morphologically similar, "cryptic" species. Given that amphibians are one of the most threatened groups of organisms on the planet, our inability to diagnose their true diversity is likely to have significant conservation consequences. This is particularly true in areas undergoing rapid deforestation, such as Southeast Asia. The Southeast Asian genus Leptolalax is a group of small-bodied, morphologically conserved frogs that inhabit the forest-floor. We examined a particularly smallbodied and morphologically conserved subset, the Leptolalax applebyi group, using a combination of molecular, morphometric, and acoustic data to identify previously unknown diversity within. In order to predict the geographic distribution of the group, estimate the effects of habitat loss and assess the degree of habitat protection, we used our locality data to perform ecological niche modelling using MaxEnt. Molecular (mtDNA and nuDNA), acoustic and subtle morphometric differences revealed a significant underestimation of diversity in the L. applebyi group; at least two-thirds of the diversity may be unrecognised. Patterns of diversification and microendemism in the group appear driven by limited dispersal, likely due to their small body size, with several lineages restricted to watershed basins. The L. applebyi group is predicted to have historically occurred over a large area of the Central Highlands of Vietnam, a considerable portion of which has already been deforested. Less than a quarter of the remaining forest predicted to be suitable for the group falls within current protected areas. The predicted distribution of the L. applebyi group extends into unsurveyed watershed basins, each potentially containing unsampled diversity, some of which may have already been lost due to deforestation. Current estimates of amphibian diversity based on morphology alone are misleading, and accurate alpha taxonomy is essential to accurately prioritize conservation efforts. {\textcopyright} 2015 Rowley et al.

abstract = {Empirical species distribution models are widely used to predict the effects of climate change on biodiversity distribution but rely on multiple assumptions about the certainty of the locality and climate data. Here, we assess the effect of historical climate data variability when forecasting geographic responses of California mammals to 20th century climate change. We first used two methods to derive gridded climate surfaces from weather station data (ANUSPLIN and PRISM) representing two sampling eras: historic (1900-1940) and current (1980-2005). We then used the two sources of climate data in conjunction with a maximum entropy algorithm (MAXENT) to predict both the historic and current distributions of all major mammal species vouchered historically in California. Results indicate that levels of disagreement between the two climate datasets are considerably greater in the historical era than in the current era. For the bioclimatic variables used in modeling historical mammal distributions, precipitation variables were less concordant than temperature variables. These discrepancies are reflected in the low agreement between historic mammal range predictions and further propagated when the historic models are projected to present day. Nonetheless, some common patterns exist across mammal species and climate estimates. Range stability is the most common prediction between the two eras, followed by expansion and contraction. Jepson ecoregions with relatively high levels of range stability include parts of the Great Central Valley and Sierra Nevada, while other parts of the Central Valley, the Sonoran desert, and Central- and Southwestern California yield predictions of range shifts. Historical species distribution modeling can greatly inform studies attempting to describe how species will continue to move geographically in response to future changes in climate. We suggest that alternative estimates of historical climate and their uncertainties are ultimately required in order to provide a quantitative measure of the confidence in predicted changes in distribution. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing.},

Sequence divergence estimates of the mtDNA control region show that the southern African representatives of R. clivosus s.l. are as distinct from samples further north in Africa than they are from R. ferrumequinum, the sister-species to R. clivosus. Within South Africa, five genetically supported geographic groups exist and these groups are corroborated by echolocation and wing morphology data. The groups loosely correspond to the distributions of the previously defined subspecies and Maxent modelling shows a strong correlation between the detected groups and ecoregions.

The whole process consisted of: (1) seabird data collection (extensive boat-based surveys and seabird tracking, conducted in 1999-2010) and compilation of relevant spatial descriptors of the marine environment; (2) species distribution modeling (SDM) aimed at identifying areas with high habitat quality for the different seabird species (3); identification and delineation of the main seabird hotspots, based on models, supported by direct seabird data, and mediated by expert opinion; (4) application of BirdLife International IBA criteria for hotspot validation; and (5) combination of hotspots from different species to set the final limits of the marine IBAs. This approach allowed to identify a series of hotspots for pelagic species in the study area, and provided nice examples of stability assessment, which slightly differed in performance between seabird species. They contributed to the Spanish marine IBA inventory, which is in the process of receiving legal protection.

abstract = {High quality habitat suitability maps are indispensable for the management and planning of wildlife reserves. This is particularly important for megadiverse developing countries where shortages in skilled manpower and funding may preclude the use of mathematically complex modeling techniques and resource-intensive field surveys. In this study, we propose a simulation based k-fold partitioning and re-substitution approach to refine and update logistic regression models that are widely used for habitat suitability assessment and modeling. We test the modeling strategy using data from a rapid field survey conducted for habitat suitability assessment for muntjak (Muntiacus muntjak) and goral (Naemorrhaedus goral) in the central Himalayas, India. Results obtained from simulations match expectations in terms of model behavior and in terms of published habitat associations of the investigated species. Qualitative comparisons with predictions from the GARP, MaxEnt and Bioclimatic Envelopes modeling systems also show broad agreement with predictions obtained from the proposed technique. The proposed technique is suggested as a rapid-assessment precursor to detailed habitat studies such as patch occupancy modeling in situations where funds or trained manpower are not available. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Southern Ground-Hornbill Bucorvus leadbeateri (SGH) is regarded as Vulnerable globally and Endangered in South Africa as a result of losing close to 70{\%} of its range and 50{\%} of its historic population in the country. One of the conservation tools being used to address this issue and restore the population to its historic range is reintroductions. The aim of this study was to identify and prioritise probable reintroduction sites in the Mopane Bioregion and the Limpopo and Mpumalanga sections of the Lowveld Bioregion of South Africa (all in the Savanna Biome), by using a niche-based modelling technique (Maxent) combined with GIS analyses. Suitable SGH habitat was determined for farms in the study area and evaluated for the absence of mappable threats. Three priority areas were identified for reintroductions. These areas are in a near-natural state, offer sufficient habitat, are free of mappable threats and are close to formally protected areas. Field surveys of these three priority areas are needed next to validate their suitability for reintroduction purposes. This is the first spatially explicit reintroduction plan for the SGH that has been developed and will contribute to conservationists' efforts to conserve the SGH. {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract = {Testing climatic niche divergence and modeling habitat suitability under conditions of climate change are important for developing strategies to limit the introduction and expansion of alien invasive weeds (AIWs) and providing important ecological and evolutionary insights. We assessed climatic niches in both native and invasive ranges as well as habitat suitability under climate change for eight representative Chinese AIWs from the American continent. We used climatic variables associated with occurrence records and developed ecological niche models with Maxent. Interestingly, the climatic niches of all eight AIWs diverged significantly between the native and invasive ranges (the American continent and China). Furthermore, the AIWs showed larger climatic niche breadths in the invasive ranges than in the native ranges. Our results suggest that climatic niche shifts between native and invasive ranges occurred. Thus, the occurrence records of both native and invasive regions must be considered when modeling and predicting the spatial distributions of AIWs under current and future climate scenarios. Owing to high habitat suitability, AIWs were more likely to expand into regions of low latitude, and future climate change was predicted to result in a shift in the AIWs in Qinghai and Tibet (regions of higher altitude) as well as Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, and Gansu (regions of higher latitude). Our results suggest that we need measures to prevent and control AIW expansion at the country-wide level. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {The distribution and use of pelagic habitat by sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) is poorly understood in the south-eastern Indian Ocean off Western Australia. However, a variety of data are available via online portals where records of historical expeditions, commercial whaling operations, and modern scientific research voyages can now be accessed. Crowdsourcing these online data allows collation of presence-only information of animals and provides a valuable tool to help augment areas of low research effort. Four data sources were examined, the primary one being the Voyage of the Odyssey expedition, a 5-year global study of sperm whales and ocean pollution. From December 2001 to May 2002, acoustic surveys were conducted along 5200 nautical miles of transects off Western Australia including the Perth Canyon and historical whaling grounds off Albany; 60 tissue biopsy samples were also collected. To augment areas not surveyed by the RV Odyssey, historical Yankee whaling data (1712-1920), commercial whaling data (1904-1999), and citizen science reports of sperm whale sightings (1990-2003) were used. Using Maxent, a species distribution modeling tool, we found that the submarine canyons off Albany and Perth provide important habitat for sperm whales. Current technology, along with current understanding of sperm whale bioacoustics and habitat preferences, provides strong motivation for undertaking long-term passive acoustic studies that can monitor the sperm whale population within Australia's EEZ waters (Perth and Albany canyons) as a way of informing future marine management and policy decisions. {\textcopyright} 2016 Johnson, Beckley, Kobryn, Johnson, Kerr and Payne.},

abstract = {Climate change has the potential to have significant influence on distribution of many species and alter ecosystems. With the current estimates of rate of projected environmental change for the 21st century, urgent adaptation and mitigation measures are required to slow down the impact of climate change on biodiversity. A number of studies have shown that recent human-induced environmental changes have already triggered species range shifts, changes in phenology and species extinctions. However, accurate projections of species responses to future climate change are more difficult to ascertain. In recent years, a number of modeling tools are being used to predict the consequences of climate change on the distribution of species and also identify possible ecological niche of a species under different climate change scenarios. In this paper, using the distribution data of the species, we have attempted to (a) identify the current geographical distribution of five species of the family Myristicaceae and predict the possible sites of occurrence of these species in the Western Ghats, India using the niche modeling tools and (b) predict the impact of climate change on the potential distribution of these species for two scenarios (A1B and A2A). All the five species selected for the study are distributed in the Western Ghats with higher densities in the Central Western Ghats. The model predicted an overall increase in the suitable habitats for the non-swampy species. However, there is a shift in the habitat range of these species in response to climate change. Gymnocranthera canarica and Myristica fatua, which are obligate swampy species, tend to be affected in changing climate. For both these species, the overall habitat is reduced due to climate change. These species already have restricted habitat and therefore climate change could pose a serious threat for their future survival. Predicting how species distribution will change in the wake of future global climate change is important to develop effective conservation strategies for these species, which inhabit fragile ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Using 25 years of combined fire and climate data, we identified unique antecedent patterns of climate conditions prior to fires in the Great Basin and Upper Colorado River Basin. Five distinct antecedent patterns of climate related to fire were found within the region; with these antecedent patterns we were able to construct models of fire danger. The occurrence of these antecedent patterns varies both spatially and temporally, and appears to be driven by drought severity. We used a Maximum Entropy approach to model the spatial extent and strength of these fire-climate patterns, and the associated fire danger. This approach provides land managers with a practical way to assess fire danger at a relatively fine spatial scale and also gives researchers a tool for assessing future fire danger.},

abstract = {At the local spatial scale, land-use variables are often employed as predictors for ecological niche models (ENMs). Remote sensing can provide additional synoptic information describing vegetation structure in detail. However, there is limited knowledge on which environmental variables and how many of them should be used to calibrate ENMs. We used an information-theoretic approach to compare the performance of ENMs using different sets of predictors: (1) a full set of land-cover variables (seven, obtained from the LGN6 Dutch National Land Use Database); (2) a reduced set of land-cover variables (three); (3) remotely sensed laser data optimized to measure vegetation structure and canopy height (LiDAR, light detection and ranging); and (4) combinations of land cover and LiDAR. ENMs were built for a set of bird species in the Veluwe Natura 2000 site (the Netherlands); for each species, 26-214 records were available from standardized monitoring. Models were built using MaxEnt, and the best performing models were identified using the Akaike's information criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc). For 78{\%} of the bird species analysed, LiDAR data were included in the best AICc model. The model including LiDAR only was the best performing one in most cases, followed by the model including a reduced set of land-use variables. Models including many land-use variables tended to have limited support. The number of variables included in the best model increased for species with more presence records. For all species with 33 records or less, the best model included LiDAR only. Models with many land-use variables were only selected for species with {\textgreater}150 records. Test area under the curve (AUC) scores ranged between 0.72 and 0.92. Remote sensing data can thus provide regional information useful for modelling at the local and landscape scale, particularly when presence records are limited. ENMs can be optimized through the selection of the number and identity of environmental predictors. Few variables can be sufficient if presence records are limited in number. Synoptic remote sensing data provide a good measure of vegetation structure and may allow a better representation of the available habitat, being extremely useful in this case. Conversely, a larger number of predictors, including land-use variables, can be useful if a large number of presence records are available. {\textcopyright} 2014 {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {The opening of the Gibraltar land bridge occurred at the end of the Messinian Salinity Crisis approximately 5.3 Mya, and was one of the main causes of vicariance between European and north-west African amphibians, resulting in the origin of several new species. However, little is currently known about the causes for post-Messinian amphibian differentiation in the Maghreb, although it is acknowledged that the Pleistocene glaciations probably had considerable influence on several species. The current study uses both species distribution modelling (MAXENT) and information from a total of 694 bp of mitochondrial data (351 from cytochrome b and 342 from 12S rRNA) from 36 representatives of all three recognized subspecies of Moroccan Salamandra to infer the phylogeny and biogeography of Salamandra algira tingitana, which is characterized by both viviparous and ovoviviparous populations. According to the results, the split between S. a. tingitana and S. a. algira from the Rif and Middle Atlas mountains took place approximately 1.6 Mya, and could have been caused by a shift towards a colder and drier climate that occurred during the upper Pliocene, which may have resulted in the isolation of Salamandra at increasingly higher altitudes, or in other climatically favourable areas. Several lineages within S. a. tingitana originated during the Pleistocene climatic oscillations, one of which gave rise to the viviparous populations north of the Oued Martil. It is suggested that the origin of viviparity in S. a. tingitana occurred during the last 600 000 years. In order to further understand the origin of the unique viviparous population of S. algira from North Africa, predictive distribution models of the viviparous and ovoviviparous populations of S. a. tingitana were created using MAXENT to assess environmental differences. Niche divergence was subsequently determined using Schoener's D and Warren et al.'s I niche similarity metrics. Predictive modelling and niche divergence analyses revealed significant environmental differences between the two reproductive types, which could have influenced the transition from ovoviviparity to viviparity. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.},

abstract = {To manage anthropogenic environmental change for the benefit of biodiversity, we must improve our understanding of the complex relationships between organisms and their environment. We have developed multiscale habitat suitability models (HSMs) for bats, a mobile group of mammals, for a geographically varied region of the UK. We ask whether the models have sufficient accuracy to contribute to informed decision-making in habitat management and in minimizing the impact of climate change and human infrastructural development. We used acoustic surveys supplemented by catching to gather presence data for eight species from 30 sites across the south of the Lake District National Park in NW England. Species were identified by manual and automated extraction and analysis of echolocation calls. Fine-resolution (50 and 100 m) habitat maps were generated at twelve spatial scales by calculating the variables across squares of increasing size, from 100 to 6000 m, around each focal 50 or 100 m square. Presence-only HSM software, MaxEnt, was used to determine the predictive power of each habitat variable at each scale. Multiscale models included data for each variable at the scale at which it had the strongest relationship with the presence of each species. The best multiscale models were selected using fivefold cross-validation, with backwards, stepwise variable removal, whilst minimizing residual spatial autocorrelation and sampling bias. Further tests with independent field data indicated good model transferability across the entire National Park. Foraging bats were generally most strongly associated with variables measured at small spatial scales and distance measures. However, each species responded differently across the range of scales, and strong associations were also found at the largest scale of analysis (6000 m). Synthesis and applications. The best models for determining habitat suitability had few variables, making them easy to interpret and use in practical conservation planning. The approach is applicable to any taxa for which reliable presence records are available, providing insight into the potential impacts of land-use and environmental change. Maps identify areas of conservation concern, such as hot spots for diversity, rare or vulnerable species and potential or threatened network corridors, making them useful for ecological impact assessment of proposed developments, and to conservation managers planning habitat creation or improvement.

The black-spotted tokay is characterized by a small body size and dark skin with sundry spots, while the red-spotted tokay has a relatively large body size and red spots. Based on morphological, karyotypic, genetic, and distribution differences, recent studies suggested their species status; however, their classifications remain controversial, and additional data such as ecological niches are necessary to establish firm hypotheses regarding their taxonomic status. We reconstructed their ecological niches models using climatic and geographic data. We then performed niche similarity tests (niche identity and background tests) and point-based analyses to explore whether ecological differentiation has occurred, and whether such differences are sufficient to explain the maintenance of their separate segments of environmental ranges. We found that both niche models of the black- and the red-spotted tokay had a good fit and a robust performance, as indicated by the high area under the curve (AUC) values ("black" = 0.982, SD = ± 0.002, "red" = 0.966 ± 0.02). Significant ecological differentiation across the entire geographic range was found, indicating that the involvement of ecological differentiation is important for species differentiation. Divergence along the environmental axes is highly associated with climatic conditions, with isothermality being important for the "black" form, while temperature seasonality, precipitation of warmest quarter, and annual temperature range together being important for the "red" form. These factors are likely important factors in niche differentiation between the two forms, which result in morphological replacement. Overall, beside morphological and genetic differentiation information, our results contribute to additional insights into taxonomic distinction and niche differentiation between the black- and the red-spotted tokay. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Sustainable management strategies for tropical forest ecosystems require a detailed understanding of the distribution of tropical forest species, limitations on distribution, as well as occurrence patterns in the absence of limitations. In the Americas, many tropical palms (Arecaceae) are locally abundant keystone species that provide a number of non-timber forest products. Here we focus on 10 such species (Aphandra natalia, Attalea phalerata, Euterpe oleracea, Iriartea deltoidea, Mauritia flexousa, Oenocarpus bataua, Phytelephas aequatorialis, Phytelephas macrocarpa, and Phytelephas seemannii) found in western South America. This study aimed to determine: (i) what variables control potential species distribution, (ii) whether their distribution is spatially constrained and if so, (iii) how their potential ranges compare to their actual ranges. We built species distribution models using Maxent software with three groups of predictor variables: C (climatic), N (non-climatic environmental), S (spatial), and combinations thereof: C, CN and CNS. The CNS predictor variable combination gave superior predictive ability based on median Area Under the Curve (AUC) values and was consistent with available range maps. In contrast, individual C and CN predictor variables gave inferior AUC values and showed less similarity to range maps. We concluded that the CNS model that combined climatic, non-climatic, and spatial variables best represented the actual distribution of the 10 palm species, whereas C and CN models approached their potential distribution. Precipitation during the driest quarter and annual precipitation were the most important predictors of the potential distribution, whereas temperature of the coldest month, soil, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were less important. We found that the actual distributions of palm species were spatially constrained, and that the spatial variables largely coincided with the dispersal barriers of the Andean Cordillera and past climatic fluctuations. The estimated potential range varied from nearly equal to the actual range, to up to 0.55×106km2 (55.1×106ha) larger than the actual range, depending on model, threshold settings, and species. We thus concluded that current palm resources in the forests of western South America have major potential for ecological expansion. These results are relevant to current palm management and resource conservation planning, as well as future strategies that will have to address climate change and increasing human disturbance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Entropy maximization (EM, also known as MaxEnt) is a general inference procedure that originated in statistical mechanics. It has been applied recently to predict ecological patterns, such as species abundance distributions and species-area relationships. It is well known in physics that the EM result strongly depends on how elementary configurations are described. Here we argue that the same issue is also of crucial importance for EM applications in ecology. To illustrate this, we focus on the EM prediction of species-level spatial abundance distributions. We show that the EM outcome depends on (1) the choice of configuration set, (2) the way constraints are imposed, and (3) the scale on which the EM procedure is applied. By varying these choices in the EM model, we obtain a large range of EM predictions. Interestingly, they correspond to spatial abundance distributions that have been derived previously from mechanistic models.We argue that the appropriate choice of the EMmodel assumptions is nontrivial and can be determined only by comparison with empirical data. {\textcopyright} 2010 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract = {Habitat assessments for biodiversity conservation are often complicated by the lack of detailed knowledge of a study species' distribution. As an alternative to resource-intensive field-based methods to obtain such information, remotely sensed products can be utilized in species distribution models to infer a species' distribution and ecological needs. Here we demonstrate how to arbitrate among a variety of remotely sensed predictor variables to estimate the distribution and ecological needs of an endangered butterfly species occurring mainly in inaccessible areas. We classified 19 continuous environmental predictor variables into three conceptually independent predictor classes, terrain, land cover, and vertical vegetation structure, and compared the accuracy of competing Maxent habitat models consisting of different combinations of each class. Each class contributed, though disproportionately, to our most reliable model that considered all 19 variables. We confirm that variables obtained from remote sensors can effectively estimate the distribution and ecological needs of a relatively unknown imperiled species occurring in inaccessible locations.

abstract = {In this review, we examine two new trait-based models of community assembly that predict the relative abundance of species from a regional species pool. The models use fundamentally different mathematical approaches and the predictions can differ considerably. Maxent obtains the most even probability distribution subject to community-weighted mean trait constraints. Traitspace predicts low probabilities for any species whose trait distribution does not pass through the environmental filter. Neither model maximizes functional diversity because of the emphasis on environmental filtering over limiting similarity. Traitspace can test for the effects of limiting similarity by explicitly incorporating intraspecific trait variation. The range of solutions in both models could be used to define the range of natural variability of community composition in restoration projects. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus, which reached the West African region approximately 8 years ago, has established viable populations in C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire and Benin and spread rapidly from the assumed points of introduction. However, existing maps of its distribution range do not agree on the areas at risk, most probably due to suboptimal modelling approaches. Therefore, we undertook a re-investigation of the potential distribution range based on a high-quality dataset from West Africa that includes information on 104 farms located all over Benin. Focussing on climate suitability and applying advanced modelling, a subset of representative and uncorrelated climate variables was selected and fed into Maxent software to obtain an estimate of climate suitability for West Africa. The resulting map was validated using an independent dataset of 13 farms along the apparent distribution edge. The entire southern part of West Africa (covering southern Nigeria, Benin, Togo and Ghana) features high climate suitability for R. microplus. All of C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire is inside the distribution range of this tick and the southern rim of Burkina Faso is expected to be suitable for the establishment of R. microplus populations. The validation of the distribution, dated one year after the initial field visit, confirmed the predicted distribution range, although a small number of individuals of R. microplus were found north of the predicted limit. These low numbers might indicate that the climate is not suitable for the establishment of a viable tick population. An alternative explanation is the recent introduction by nomadic cattle herds passing through this location. In this region of the world, it is quite common for cattle owners to lead their livestock over distances of more than 500 km in search of food and water.},

abstract = {The development and growth of geospatial techniques offer many advantages and challenges to the study of biodiversity, especially in the present era of climate change. We are now at the beginning of the international decade for biodiversity and by the time we travel through the decade, there would be sea-changes in the measurement and monitoring approaches, database management options, and inter-linked studies on biodiversity. With the onset of geoinformatics techniques comprising remote sensing, global positioning system (GPS), integrative tools, such as GIS, is realized as a complimentary system to ground-based biodiversity studies. Recently, a nationwide biodiversity study at landscape level using geoinformatics modeling techniques for India has been completed. The study has assessed plant diversity using a three-tier approach, wherein six biodiversity attributes (i. e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical, and ecological) were linked together based on their relative importance to stratify biological richness of forest vegetation (non-agricultural) of India. It has enumerated 7,964 plant species from 20,000 nested quadrate sampling plots of 0.04 ha each, delineated and mapped 120 vegetation classes; and organized the geo-spatial database on bisindia web portal. Here, we have (i) proposed a method to incorporate the fauna component in-line up with the existing methodology and (ii) utilized the GPS-gathered positional information on the distribution of two species (i.e., Medicago sativa and Poa annua to simulate their distribution for the year 2020 (SRES A1-B scenario, IPCC) using Maxent model. The study conducted in a test site of western Himalayas estimated (i) 24{\%} increase in the overall biologically rich areas on supplement of fauna data and (ii) distribution of both the species would tend to increase in favor of shorter cold season. The study highlights the importance of geoinformatics technique-based biodiversity study for its amenability to incorporate any further change or modification, and utility of the geo-spatial biodiversity database for simulating various species distribution scenarios to understand their ecology in today's fast changing climate for effective conservation prescriptions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Habitat suitability for this tick species was predicted using Maxent modelling technique based on R. appendiculatus records in Sub-Saharan Africa. Two models were developed: the first is based on the tropical R. appendiculatus distribution and the one is based on the distribution records in the temperate region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The tropical model shows favourable habitat in much of the Ethiopian highlands. The whole Djibouti, the south eastern Ethiopian lowlands, majority of Somalia and Eritrea were found to be not suitable for the survival and development of this tick species. Highly suitable areas occur in areas which have moderate temperature and high precipitation. Introductions of R. appendiculatus into the Horn of Africa probably have been prevented by the natural barrier between the known R. appendiculatus distribution range in East Africa and the Horn of Africa. The effect of an introduction of R. appendiculatus and thereby ECF into the Horn of Africa could be catastrophic since the cattle in this area have no immunity against ECF, and mortality might be considerable in all age groups of cattle. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The level of agreement between GARP and Maxent predictions was low when {\textless} 15 occurrences were available, probably indicating a minimum number below that necessary to obtain models with good predictive power. Unexpectedly, our results suggested that Maxent extrapolated more than GARP in the context of small sample sizes. Predictions were overlapped with current land use and location of protected areas to estimate the conservation status of each species. Our analyses yielded range predictions generally contradicting with extents of occurrence established by the IUCN. We evidenced a high level of disturbance within predicted distributions in West and East Africa, Sumatra, and South-East Asia, and identified within West African degraded lowlands four relatively preserved areas that might be of prime importance for the conservation of rainforest taxa. Knowing whether these species of viverrids may survive in degraded or alternative habitats is of crucial importance for further conservation planning. The level of coverage of species suitable ranges by existing and proposed IUCN reserves was low, and we recommend that the total surface of protected areas be substantially increased on both continents. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

To determine the distribution of A. crataegi, data from a total of 36 collecting points throughout South Korea, North Korea, China, Japan, Mongolia, and Russia are used. The spatial distributions of the data were examined through MaxEnt modeling. The distribution probability rates exceeded 75{\%} at 18 locations among the 36 species occurrence locations, with Gangwon province showing the highest distribution probability in South Korea. The precision of the MaxEnt model was remarkably high, with an AUC value of 0.982. The variables that affect the potential distribution of A. crataegi by more than 10{\%} are the degree of temperature seasonality, the amount of precipitation in the warmest quarter, the annual mean temperature, and the amount of precipitation in the driest month, in that order of importance. It was found that the future potential distribution area of A. crataegi continuously moves northward over time up to 2070s. In addition, the area of the potential distribution showing a habitable probability rate that exceeds 75{\%} in northeast Asia was 28,492 km2, where the area of potential distribution in the north part of Korean peninsula was 20.404 km2 in size. Thus, it is anticipated that the most important future habitats of A. crataegi in the northeast Asia will be North and South Hamgyeong provinces and Ryanggang province near Mt. Baekdoosan in the northern area of the Korean peninsula. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Ecological Society of Korea. All rights are reserved.},

abstract = {An isolated outbreak of the emerging forest disease sudden oak death was discovered in Oregon forests in 2001. Despite considerable control efforts, disease continues to spread from the introduction site due to slow and incomplete detection and eradication. Annual field surveys and laboratory tests between 2001 and 2009 confirmed a total of 802 infested locations. Here, we apply two invasive species distribution models (iSDMs) of sudden oak death establishment and spread risk to target early detection and control further disease spread in Oregon forests. The goal was to develop (1) a model of potential distribution that estimates the level and spatial variability of disease establishment and spread risk for western Oregon, and (2) a model of actual distribution that quantifies the relative likelihood of current invasion in the quarantine area. Our predictions were based on four groups of primary parameters that vary in space and time: climate conditions, topographical factors, abundance and susceptibility of host vegetation, and dispersal pressure. First, we used multi-criteria evaluation to identify large-scale areas at potential risk of infection. We mapped and ranked host abundance and susceptibility using geospatial vegetation data developed with gradient nearest neighbor imputation. The host vegetation and climate variables were parameterized in accordance to their epidemiological importance and the final appraisal scores were summarized by month to represent a cumulative spread risk index, standardized as five categories from very low to very high risk. Second, using the field data for calibration we applied the machine-learning method, maximum entropy, to predict the actual distribution of the sudden oak death epidemic. The dispersal pressure incorporated in the statistical model estimates the force of invasion at all susceptible locations, allowing us to quantify the relative likelihood of current disease incidence rather than its potential distribution. Our predictions show that 65km2 of forested land was invaded by 2009, but further disease spread threatens more than 2100km2 of forests across the western region of Oregon (very high and high risk). Areas at greatest risk of disease spread are concentrated in the southwest region of Oregon where the highest densities of susceptible host species exist. This research identifies high priority locations for early detection and invasion control and illustrates how iSDMs can be used to analyze the actual versus potential distribution of emerging infectious disease in a complex, heterogeneous ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Climate change predictions for the Great Plains region of North America include increased temperatures and changes to annual precipitation patterns. We used ecological niche modeling (Maxent) to assess how three climate change scenarios published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change might affect the distribution of the threatened lace hedgehog cactus (Echinocereus reichenbachii) by the 2050s and the 2080s. Under all scenarios investigated, the total land area of suitable habitat for the species increased relative to the current land area predicted as highly suitable by the model. However, under all scenarios, the center of the most suitable area for this species shifted by 160604 km from the current location in northwest Texas, changing at a rate 20-75 km per decade. While the rate of dispersal in this species is not known, Echinocereus spp. seeds are typically spread by small mammals and it seems unlikely that this species will be able to disperse rapidly. Consequently, the range may initially contract during the coming century, especially in southern Texas where it is most imperiled and where the climate is predicted to become increasingly unsuitable. The current patchiness of distribution of the species suggests that microhabitat characteristics and limitations to dispersal might reduce its actual realized niche relative to the fundamental niche indicated by the models. In addition, land use for agriculture, grazing, and urbanization might further reduce the success of this species in a changing climate. {\textcopyright} Torrey Botanical Club.},

The purpose of this study was to create a distribution model for the invasive dinoflagellate C. furcoides in South America in order to further investigate the basins at potential risk, as well as the environmental conditions that influence its expansion. This species is known to develop blooms due to its mobility, resistance to sedimentation, and optimized use of resources. Although nontoxic, blooms of the species cause many problems to both the natural ecosystems and water users. Potential distribution was predicted by using a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). Model was run with 101 occurrences obtained from the scientific literature, and climatic, hydrological and topographic variables. The developed model had a very good performance for the study area. The most susceptible areas identified were mainly concentrated in the basins between southeastern Brazil and northeastern Argentina. Besides already affected regions, new potentially suitable areas were identified in temperate regions of South America.

To reach our goals, we compiled data available in the literature and from scientific collections, as well as unpublished data. We identified records of P. centralis in 123 localities, 86 of those records remain unpublished. Consequently, it is possible to extend its range of distribution to the state of Rond{\^{o}}nia, Brazil, and also to the Caatinga formation. The Maxent algorithm provided a model of potential distribution consistent with the distribution proposed here. Results indicate that P. centralis has a large distribution associated to open areas of South America (Cerrado, Caatinga and Pantanal), with no evidence that this is a case of species complex. The multiple approach proposed herein, that combines occurrence data from different sources and molecular data to confirm species identification, provided consistent results. Therefore, we recommend that this framework be used as a protocol to assess species distribution in future studies, especially in the case of widely distributed species. {\textcopyright} 2017 Istituto per lo Studio degli Ecosistemi of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Firenze.},

abstract = {The MaxEnt software package is one of the most popular tools for species distribution and environmental niche modeling, with over 1000 published applications since 2006. Its popularity is likely for two reasons: 1) MaxEnt typically outperforms other methods based on predictive accuracy and 2) the software is particularly easy to use. MaxEnt users must make a number of decisions about how they should select their input data and choose from a wide variety of settings in the software package to build models from these data. The underlying basis for making these decisions is unclear in many studies, and default settings are apparently chosen, even though alternative settings are often more appropriate. In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of how MaxEnt works and a prospectus on modeling options to enable users to make informed decisions when preparing data, choosing settings and interpreting output. We explain how the choice of background samples reflects prior assumptions, how nonlinear functions of environmental variables (features) are created and selected, how to account for environmentally biased sampling, the interpretation of the various types of model output and the challenges for model evaluation. We demonstrate MaxEnt's calculations using both simplified simulated data and occurrence data from South Africa on species of the flowering plant family Proteaceae. Throughout, we show how MaxEnt's outputs vary in response to different settings to highlight the need for making biologically motivated modeling decisions. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

The true distribution of many midwater species, let alone the abiotic factors most important in determining that distribution, is not well known. Because collecting specimens and data from the deep ocean is expensive and logistically difficult, it would be useful to be able to predict where species of interest are likely to occur so that sampling effort can be concentrated in appropriate areas. The distribution of two representative midwater fishes, the gulper eel Eurypharynx pelecanoides and the bobtail eel Cyema atrum (Teleostei: Saccopharyngiformes), were modeled with MaxEnt software to examine the viability of species distribution modeling (SDM) for globally distributed midwater fishes using currently available environmental data from the ocean surface and bottom. These species were chosen because they are relatively abundant, easily recognized, and unlikely to have been misidentified in database records, and are true midwater fishes, not known to undertake significant vertical diurnal migration. Models for both species show a generally worldwide distribution with some exceptions, including the Southern Ocean and Bering Sea.

abstract = {Aim: Species distribution modelling typically relies completely or partially on climatic variables as predictors, overlooking the fact that these are themselves predictions with associated uncertainties. This is particularly critical when such predictors are interpolated between sparse station data, such as in the tropics. The goal of this study is to provide a new set of satellite-based climatic predictor data and to evaluate its potential to improve modelled species-climate associations and transferability to novel geographical regions. Location: Rain forests areas of Central Africa, the Western Ghats of India and South America. Methods: We compared models calibrated on the widely used WorldClim station-interpolated climatic data with models where either temperature or precipitation data from WorldClim were replaced by data from CRU, MODIS, TRMM and CHIRPS. Each predictor set was used to model 451 plant species distributions. To test for chance associations, we devised a null model with which to compare the accuracy metric obtained for every species. Results: Fewer than half of the studied rain forest species distributions matched the climatic pattern better than did random distributions. The inclusion of MODIS temperature and CHIRPS precipitation estimates derived from remote sensing each allowed for a better than random fit for respectively 40{\%} and 22{\%} more species than models calibrated on WorldClim. Furthermore, their inclusion was positively related to a better transferability of models to novel regions. Main conclusions: We provide a newly assembled dataset of ecologically meaningful variables derived from MODIS and CHIRPS for download, and provide a basis for choosing among the plethora of available climate datasets. We emphasize the need to consider the method used in the production of climate data when working on a region with sparse meteorological station data. In this context, remote sensing data should be the preferred choice, particularly when model transferability to novel climates or inferences on causality are invoked. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {We compared predictive success in two common algorithms for modeling species' ecological niches, GARP and Maxent, in a situation that challenged the algorithms to be general - that is, to be able to predict the species' distributions in broad unsampled regions, here termed transferability. The results were strikingly different between the two algorithms - Maxent models reconstructed the overall distributions of the species at low thresholds, but higher predictive levels of Maxent predictions reflected overfitting to the input data; GARP models, on the other hand, succeeded in anticipating most of the species' distributional potential, at the cost of increased (apparent, at least) commission error. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) tests were weak in discerning models able to predict into broad unsampled areas from those that were not. Such transferability is clearly a novel challenge for modeling algorithms, and requires different qualities than does predicting within densely sampled landscapes - in this case, Maxent was transferable only at very low thresholds, and biases and gaps in input data may frequently affect results based on higher Maxent thresholds, requiring careful interpretation of model results. {\textcopyright} Ecography.},

abstract = {The potential distribution of critically rare or endangered species is necessary to assess species conservation status and guide recovery plans. Habitat models based on remotely sensed geospatial data are increasingly used to predict the suitability of sites for rare and endangered species, but in rapidly changing landscapes, habitat evaluations must reflect temporal as well as spatial variation of environmental suitability in order to properly inform management. We used field measurements of species occurrence, a 22-yr time series of satellite images, and the Maximum Entropy modeling approach (Maxent) to monitor spatio-temporal variation in habitat suitability of an endangered butterfly that uses riparian wetlands modified by beaver activity. We modeled the niche of the St. Francis' satyr Neonympha mitchellii francisci in an environment of remotely sensed metrics and projected the niche model over space and time to evaluate habitat dynamics and target sites for reintroduction efforts. Suitable habitat for the subspecies is currently distributed across the study area; however, most of the suitable area is unoccupied, and patches of the most suitable habitat have shifted over time in response to beaver activity and subsequent wetland succession, suggesting a negative interaction between dispersal limitation and landscape dynamics. Landcover changes complicate the recovery of critically threatened species such as N. m. francisci, but habitat monitoring over time can improve recovery plans, offer adaptive management strategies, and provide more exact criteria for species status assignment. Spatio-temporal extensions of the niche/habitat concept are made possible by long-term archives of remotely sensed data, and will likely prove most useful in rapidly changing landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.

abstract = {Summary: Two dominant drivers of species distributions are climate and habitat, both of which are changing rapidly. Understanding the relative importance of variables that can control distributions is critical, especially for invasive species that may spread rapidly and have strong effects on ecosystems. Here, we examine the relative importance of climate and habitat variables in controlling the distribution of the widespread invasive freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea, and we model its future distribution under a suite of climate scenarios using logistic regression and maximum entropy modelling (MaxEnt). Logistic regression identified climate variables as more important than habitat variables in controlling Corbicula distribution. MaxEnt modelling predicted Corbicula's range expansion westward and northward to occupy half of the contiguous United States. By 2080, Corbicula's potential range will expand 25-32{\%}, with more than half of the continental United States being climatically suitable. Our combination of multiple approaches has revealed the importance of climate over habitat in controlling Corbicula's distribution and validates the climate-only MaxEnt model, which can readily examine the consequences of future climate projections. Given the strong influence of climate variables on Corbicula's distribution, as well as Corbicula's ability to disperse quickly and over long distances, Corbicula is poised to expand into New England and the northern Midwest of the United States. Thus, the direct effects of climate change will probably be compounded by the addition of Corbicula and its own influences on ecosystem function. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

However, management of biological invasions requires use of adequate tools to understand and predict invasion patterns in recently introduced areas. The present study: (1) estimates the potential geographic distribution and ecological requirements of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile Mayr), one of the most conspicuous invasive species throughout the world, in the Iberian Peninsula using ecological niche modeling, and (2) provides new insights into the process of selection of consensual areas among predictions from several modeling methodologies. Ecological niche models were developed using 5 modeling techniques: generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), generalized boosted models (GBM), Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP), and Maximum Entropy (Maxent). Models for the eastern and western portions of the Iberian Peninsula were built using subsets of occurrence and environmental data to investigate the potential for ecological niche differences between the invading populations. Our results indicate geographic differences between predictions of different approaches, and the utility of ensemble predictions in identifying areas of uncertainty regarding the species' invasive potential. More generally, our models predict coastal areas and major river corridors as highly suitable for Argentine ants, and indicate that western and eastern Iberian Peninsula populations occupy similar environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Eutrophication is severely affecting species distributions and ecosystem functioning in coastal areas. Targets for eutrophication reduction have been set in the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) using Secchi depth, a measure of water transparency, as the main status indicator. Despite the high economic costs involved, the potential effects of this political decision on key species and habitats have not been assessed. In a case study including species central to coastal ecosystem functioning, we modelled the effects of changing Secchi depth on the distribution of bladderwrack Fucus vesiculosus and eelgrass Zostera marina vegetation as well as recruitment areas of the main predatory fish species, perch Perca fluviatilis and pikeperch Sander lucioperca. Specifically, we explored the effects of changing Secchi depth on species distributions under a set of scenarios based on the BSAP, using three fundamentally different modelling techniques: maximum entropy, generalized additive and random forest modelling. Improved Secchi depth (reduced eutrophication) was predicted to cause a substantial increase in the distribution of bladderwrack, while the distribution of eelgrass remained largely unaffected. For the fish, a large increase in perch recruitment areas was predicted and a concurrent decrease in recruitment areas of pikeperch. These changes are likely to have effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services. The three modelling methods exposed differences in the quantitative predictions for species with a weaker coupling to Secchi depth. Qualitatively, however, the results were consistent for all species. Synthesis and applications. We show how ecological effects of environmental policies can be evaluated in an explicit spatial context using species distribution modelling. The model-specific responses to changes in eutrophication status emphasize the importance of using ensemble modelling for exploring how species distributions may respond to alternative management regimes. A pronounced difference in response between species suggests that eutrophication mitigation will have consequences for ecosystem functioning, and thus ecosystem goods and services, by inducing changes in the simple food webs of the Baltic Sea. These model predictions form a basis for spatially explicit cost-benefit estimates under different scenarios, providing valuable information for both decision-makers and the wider society. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {An important aspect of species distribution modelling is the choice of the modelling method because a suboptimal method may have poor predictive performance. Previous comparisons have found that novel methods, such as Maxent models, outperform well-established modelling methods, such as the standard logistic regression. These comparisons used training samples with small numbers of occurrences per estimated model parameter, and this limited sample size may have caused poorer predictive performance due to overfitting. Our hypothesis is that Maxent models would outperform a standard logistic regression because Maxent models avoid overfitting by using regularisation techniques and a standard logistic regression does not. Regularisation can be applied to logistic regression models using penalised maximum likelihood estimation. This estimation procedure shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero, causing biased predictions if applied to the training sample but improving the accuracy of new predictions. We used Maxent and logistic regression (standard and penalised) to analyse presence/pseudo-absence data for 13 tree species and evaluated the predictive performance (discrimination) using presence-absence data. The penalised logistic regression outperformed standard logistic regression and equalled the performance of Maxent. The penalised logistic regression may be considered one of the best methods to develop species distribution models trained with presence/pseudo-absence data, as it is comparable to Maxent. Our results encourage further use of the penalised logistic regression for species distribution modelling, especially in those cases in which a complex model must be fitted to a sample with a limited size. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

As a consequence, leishmaniasis has become a particularly difficult health problem, both for local inhabitants and for multinational military personnel. Methods: To evaluate coarse-resolution aspects of the ecology of leishmaniasis transmission, collection records for sandflies and Leishmania species were obtained from diverse sources. To characterize environmental variation across the country, we used multitemporal Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 2005-2011. Ecological niche models were generated using MaxEnt, and results were analyzed using background similarity tests to assess whether associations among vectors and parasites (i.e., niche similarity) can be detected across broad geographic regions. Results: We found niche similarity only between one vector species and its corresponding parasite species (i.e., Phlebotomus papatasi with Leishmania major), suggesting that geographic ranges of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis and its potential vector may overlap, but under distinct environmental associations. Other associations (e.g., P. sergenti with L. major) were not supported. Mapping suitable areas for each species suggested that northeastern Egypt is particularly at risk because both parasites have potential to circulate. Conclusions: Ecological niche modeling approaches can be used as a firstpass assessment of vector-parasite interactions, offering useful insights into constraints on the geography of transmission patterns of leishmaniasis.},

At regional scales, climate change may lead to extensive shifts in species distributions and widespread extirpations or extinctions. At landscape scales, land use and invasive species disrupt ecosystem function and reduce species richness. However, a lack of spatially explicit models of risk to ecosystems makes it difficult for science to inform conservation planning and land management. Here, I model risk to sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems in the state of Nevada, USA from climate change, land use/land cover change, and species invasion. Risk from climate change is based on an ensemble of 10 atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) projections applied to two bioclimatic envelope models (Mahalanobis distance and Maxent). Risk from land use is based on the distribution of roads, agriculture, and powerlines, and on the spatial relationships between land use and probability of cheatgrass Bromus tectorum invasion in Nevada. Risk from land cover change is based on probability and extent of pinyon-juniper (Pinus monophylla; Juniperus spp.) woodland expansion. Climate change is most likely to negatively impact sagebrush ecosystems at the edges of its current range, particularly in southern Nevada, southern Utah, and eastern Washington. Risk from land use and woodland expansion is pervasive throughout Nevada, while cheatgrass invasion is most problematic in the northern part of the state. Cumulatively, these changes pose major challenges for conservation of sagebrush and sagebrush obligate species.

abstract = {Aim Analyses of species distributions are complicated by various origins of spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in biogeographical data. SAC may be particularly important for invasive species distribution models (iSDMs) because biological invasions are strongly influenced by dispersal and colonization processes that typically create highly structured distribution patterns. We examined the efficacy of using a multi-scale framework to account for different origins of SAC, and compared non-spatial models with models that accounted for SAC at multiple levels. Location We modelled the spatial distribution of an invasive forest pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum, in western USA. Methods We applied one conventional statistical method (generalized linear model, GLM) and one nonparametric technique (maximum entropy, Maxent) to a large dataset on P. ramorum occurrence (n=3787) to develop four types of model that included environmental variables and that either ignored spatial context or incorporated it at a broad scale using trend surface analysis, a local scale using autocovariates, or multiple scales using spatial eigenvector mapping. We evaluated model accuracies and amounts of explained spatial structure, and examined the changes in predictive power of the environmental and spatial variables. Results Accounting for different scales of SAC significantly enhanced the predictive capability of iSDMs. Dramatic improvements were observed when fine-scale SAC was included, suggesting that local range-confining processes are important in P. ramorum spread. The importance of environmental variables was relatively consistent across all models, but the explanatory power decreased in spatial models for factors with strong spatial structure. While accounting for SAC reduced the amount of residual autocorrelation for GLM but not for Maxent, it still improved the performance of both approaches, supporting our hypothesis that dispersal and colonization processes are important factors to consider in distribution models of biological invasions. Main conclusions Spatial autocorrelation has become a paradigm in biogeography and ecological modelling. In addition to avoiding the violation of statistical assumptions, accounting for spatial patterns at multiple scales can enhance our understanding of dynamic processes that explain ecological mechanisms of invasion and improve the predictive performance of static iSDMs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In recent years, this imported disease has posed a serious threat to public health in China, especially in the Pearl River Delta (PRD). Although the severity of DF outbreaks in the PRD is generally associated with known risk factors, fine scale assessments of areas at high risk for DF outbreaks are limited. We built five ecological niche models to identify such areas including a variety of climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic variables, as well as, in some models, extracted principal components. All the models we tested accurately identified the risk of DF, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were greater than 0.8, but the model using all original variables was the most accurate (AUC = 0.906). Socioeconomic variables had a greater impact on this model (total contribution 55.27{\%}) than climatic and environmental variables (total contribution 44.93{\%}). We found the highest risk of DF outbreaks on the border of Guangzhou and Foshan (in the central PRD), and in northern Zhongshan (in the southern PRD).

The impact of climate change on the habitat suitability of the Artemisia species was modeled for mid century under the projected climate change of GFDL-ESM2G (RCP2.6) model, a warmer and slightly wetter condition, and CCSM4 (RCP4.5) model, a warmer and drier condition. The results showed that annual precipitation (AP) and temperature annual range (TAR) were the most important drivers of A. aucheri distribution at a regional scale.

E was not identified as the important variable influencing A. sieberi distribution when was added to the model in spite of its high correlation to AMT (r| {\textgreater} 0.8), while AP was the most important, indicating that A. sieberi is less dependent on elevation than A. aucheri.

The projected climate change using both models has a much more impact on A. aucheri, potentially driving more losses and fewer gains in climatically suitable habitat of this species as compared to A. sieberi suggesting the adaptation of the later to a wider range of climatic conditions than A. aucheri. The results of the current and future distribution modeling of the Artemisia species is significant in managing susceptible habitats of these species for climate change and for habitat restoration. {\textcopyright} 2017, Polish Academy of Sciences.

abstract = {Habitat suitability models (HSMs) have so far been used mainly to study broad-scale patterns of species distribution based on environmental variables; however, they can also be applied to address conservation needs at finer scales. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using HSMs based on presence-only data to predict bat foraging habitat suitability around maternity roosts using radio-tracking location data. We radio-marked 34 Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and 29 Myotis emarginatus from two mixed-species maternity roosts (21.5 km apart) in a Mediterranean landscape. We generated foraging habitat suitability maps for the two species and the two colonies incorporating 17 land cover variables as well as distance from the maternity roosts. We then compared the performance of four presence-only models: Mahalanobis distance, ENFA, MADIFA and MaxEnt. Our study found that all four models generated foraging habitat suitability maps that performed well at predicting the species-specific quality of foraging habitat based on the configuration of the landscape. Riparian vegetation, woodland and distance from roosts play a key role in foraging habitat selection around colonies both for R. ferrumequinum and M. emarginatus. MaxEnt was the model that best predicted suitable foraging habitats. These are also the best models at predicting foraging habitat suitability with relatively good performance around another colony maternity roost using independent radio-tracking locations. Because many bat species are threatened by foraging habitat loss, habitat suitability modeling offers a useful tool in defining appropriate conservation guidelines that protect foraging habitats around bat maternity roosts. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Invasive species can cause ecological and economic damage and can be transported by several vectors, many of which are connected to socioeconomic activities. This research presents a model that combines introduction likelihood and environmental suitability to characterize global patterns of invasion risk in coastal marine areas by identifying where a species is both likely to arrive and able to survive. The model projects environmental suitability using MaxEnt and considers commercial port locations, as a proxy for commercial shipping, to map patterns of relative invasion risk on a near global scale. A case study of five coastal marine crab species is presented. These models identify several regions that are at risk of new invasion where modeled environmental suitability and introduction likelihood overlap. The distribution of large commercial ports is near global but not evenly distributed; northern hemisphere temperate locations have a higher density of ports and tend to have more opportunities for invasion according to these models. This approach can be adapted to other marine and non-marine species and to current and future environmental and socioeconomic conditions, but it works best when occurrence data are representative of the complete range of conditions under which a species can survive. {\textcopyright} 2014, The Author(s).},

abstract = {Various methods exist to model a species' niche and geographic distribution using environmental data for the study region and occurrence localities documenting the species' presence (typically from museums and herbaria). In presence-only modelling, geographic sampling bias and small sample sizes represent challenges for many species. Overfitting to the bias and/or noise characteristic of such datasets can seriously compromise model generality and transferability, which are critical to many current applications - including studies of invasive species, the effects of climatic change, and niche evolution. Even when transferability is not necessary, applications to many areas, including conservation biology, macroecology, and zoonotic diseases, require models that are not overfit. We evaluated these issues using a maximum entropy approach (Maxent) for the shrew Cryptotis meridensis, which is endemic to the Cordillera de M{\'{e}}rida in Venezuela. To simulate strong sampling bias, we divided localities into two datasets: those from a portion of the species' range that has seen high sampling effort (for model calibration) and those from other areas of the species' range, where less sampling has occurred (for model evaluation). Before modelling, we assessed the climatic values of localities in the two datasets to determine whether any environmental bias accompanies the geographic bias. Then, to identify optimal levels of model complexity (and minimize overfitting), we made models and tuned model settings, comparing performance with that achieved using default settings. We randomly selected localities for model calibration (sets of 5, 10, 15, and 20 localities) and varied the level of model complexity considered (linear versus both linear and quadratic features) and two aspects of the strength of protection against overfitting (regularization). Environmental bias indeed corresponded to the geographic bias between datasets, with differences in median and observed range (minima and/or maxima) for some variables. Model performance varied greatly according to the level of regularization. Intermediate regularization consistently led to the best models, with decreased performance at low and generally at high regularization. Optimal levels of regularization differed between sample-size-dependent and sample-size-independent approaches, but both reached similar levels of maximal performance. In several cases, the optimal regularization value was different from (usually higher than) the default one. Models calibrated with both linear and quadratic features outperformed those made with just linear features. Results were remarkably consistent across the examined sample sizes. Models made with few and biased localities achieved high predictive ability when appropriate regularization was employed and optimal model complexity was identified. Species-specific tuning of model settings can have great benefits over the use of default settings. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The tick-borne haemoparasite Theileria orientalis is the most important infectious cause of anaemia in New Zealand cattle. Since 2012 a previously unrecorded type, T. orientalis type 2 (Ikeda), has been associated with disease outbreaks of anaemia, lethargy, jaundice and deaths on over 1000 New Zealand cattle farms, with most of the affected farms found in the upper North Island. The aim of this study was to model the relative environmental suitability for T. orientalis transmission throughout New Zealand, to predict the proportion of cattle farms potentially suitable for active T. orientalis infection by region, island and the whole of New Zealand and to estimate the average relative environmental suitability per farm by region, island and the whole of New Zealand. The relative environmental suitability for T. orientalis transmission was estimated using the Maxent (maximum entropy) modelling program. The Maxent model predicted that 99{\%} of North Island cattle farms (n = 36,257), 64{\%} South Island cattle farms (n = 15,542) and 89{\%} of New Zealand cattle farms overall (n = 51,799) could potentially be suitable for T. orientalis transmission. The average relative environmental suitability of T. orientalis transmission at the farm level was 0.34 in the North Island, 0.02 in the South Island and 0.24 overall. The study showed that the potential spatial distribution of T. orientalis environmental suitability was much greater than presumed in the early part of the Theileria associated bovine anaemia (TABA) epidemic. Maximum entropy offers a computer efficient method of modelling the probability of habitat suitability for an arthropod vectored disease. This model could help estimate the boundaries of the endemically stable and endemically unstable areas for T. orientalis transmission within New Zealand and be of considerable value in informing practitioner and farmer biosecurity decisions in these respective areas. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Thus, a large amount of information is necessary to analyse change and develop plans for proper management of natural resources. In this work we tested MaxEnt algorithm in a completely remote land-cover classification and change analysis. In order to provide an empirical example, we selected south-eastern Italian Alps, manly Trentino-South Tyrol, as test region. We classified two Landsat images (1976 and 2001) in order to forecast probability of occurrence for unsampled locations and to determine the best subset of predictors (spectral bands). A difference map for each land cover class, representing the difference between 1976 and 2001 probability of occurrence values, was built. In order to better address the patterns of change analysis, we put together difference maps and topographic variables. The latter are considered, at least in the study area, as the main environmental drivers of land-use change, in connection with climate change. Our results indicate that the selected algorithm, applied to land cover classes, can provide reliable data, especially when referring to classes with homogeneous texture properties and surface reflectance. The performed models had satisfactory predictive performance, showing relatively clear patterns of difference between the two considered time steps. The development of a methodology that, in the absence of field data, allow to obtain data on land use change dynamics, is of extreme importance for land planning and management. {\textcopyright} 2017},

Because they are affected by various threats such as habitat destruction, chytrid fungus, climate change,invasive species and human use, different approaches are needed for their conservation. In this paper we examine patterns of alpha diversity, endemism and threatened species distributions of amphibians in Bolivia. We modeled distribution data using ecological niche modeling implemented with MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy Modeling). In contrast with previous studies, we validated each individual map with specialists. Important areas for amphibian conservation were defined by overlapping species richness, endemism richness and concentration of threatened species, and then excluding all unsuitable habitats. Our goal was to identify high-priority sites for the conservation of amphibians in Bolivia. We discuss a place-based strategy (identification of priority areas) and the need for further non place-based strategies. We highlight the importance of strengthening two existing protected areas that together host up to 40{\%} of Bolivia's threatened amphibian species, and we propose alternative strategies such as ex situ conservation for those species not covered by the priority areas. Bolivia's General Directorate for Biodiversity and Protected Areas (in Spanish, Direcci{\'{o}}n General de Biodiversidad y {\'{A}}reas Protegidas (DGBAP)) and Bolivian experts are jointly using the here presented results to define a national strategy of amphibian conservation for safeguarding this important element of Bolivia's biodiversity. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V.2001.},

This study illustrates projections of not only individual but also the 'collective' response of a group of high conservation value tree species to climate change within the Caribbean small island of Trinidad. The species distribution modelling algorithm MaxEnt was used to construct models of the realised present environmental space occupied by these species based on present day climate and other environmental factors. These models were then used to estimate present and future (2050; SRES A2) distributions of these species across Trinidad. Both present and future model output were incorporated to create change maps which illustrate projected expansions, contractions and areas of stable environmental space for each species. Individual change maps were combined to create a 'collective' change map portraying projected changes in the environmental space of this species group as a whole. Most individual species and the collective group response were projected to lose more than 50{\%} of present environmental space, with the latter being limited to the southern edge of the island. Our results suggest that small islands may experience an eventual disappearance of endemics and other valuable species under SRES A2 conditions, which may serve to further depreciate global terrestrial species diversity. Application of this 'collective' response may be particularly useful for planning within the limited geographic spaces available for conservation within small islands. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

A lack of good biogeographical information of their distributions and a shortage of basic knowledge on their ecology hinder the proper evaluation of the vulnerability of those species. We used species distribution modeling techniques to fill these gaps and to estimate the vulnerability of a forest-dwelling odonate endemic from the Amazon, Diastatops nigra. We used the MaxEnt algorithm and compared the efficiency of this method in relation to the type of environmental data set (climate-only and climate+hydrographic environmental variables). We also estimated the decrease in extension of occurrence of D. nigra in relation to a recently developed model for future deforestation also produced with the MaxEnt approach. Predicted suitable areas were isolated patches in the central Amazon and many peripheral areas. In general, those areas had stable climates with low seasonality in rainfall. The Amazon deforestation frontier is expanding mainly from the south. The core area of D. nigra distribution is in the central Amazon, so in the short-term projection, the main threat for this species was not the deforestation itself. However, deforestation may extirpate some peripheral populations of this species and increase isolation among those patches of suitable areas. We suggest the use of this model for prioritizing future odonate inventories targeting the other species of the group. {\textcopyright} 2015 by The Society for Freshwater Science.},

abstract = {Probabilistic models for binary spike patterns provide a powerful tool for understanding the statistical dependencies in large-scale neural recordings. Maximum entropy (or "maxent") models, which seek to explain dependencies in terms of low-order interactions between neurons, have enjoyed remarkable success in modeling such patterns, particularly for small groups of neurons. However, these models are computationally intractable for large populations, and low-order maxent models have been shown to be inadequate for some datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a family of "universal" models for binary spike patterns, where universality refers to the ability to model arbitrary distributions over all 2m binary patterns. We construct universal models using a Dirichlet process centered on a well-behaved parametric base measure, which naturally combines the flexibility of a histogram and the parsimony of a parametric model. We derive computationally efficient inference methods using Bernoulli and cascaded logistic base measures, which scale tractably to large populations. We also establish a condition for equivalence between the cascaded logistic and the 2nd-order maxent or "Ising" model, making cascaded logistic a reasonable choice for base measure in a universal model. We illustrate the performance of these models using neural data.},

abstract = {1.Methods used to predict shifts in species' ranges because of climate change commonly involve species distribution (niche) modelling using climatic variables, future values of which are predicted for the next several decades by general circulation models. However, species' distributions also depend on factors other than climate, such as land cover, land use and soil type. Changes in some of these factors, such as soil type, occur over geologic time and are thus imperceptible over the timescale of these types of projections. Other factors, such as land use and land cover, are expected to change over shorter timescales, but reliable projections are not available. Some important predictor variables, therefore, must be treated as unchanging, or static, whether because of the properties of the variable or out of necessity. The question of how best to combine dynamic variables predicted by climate models with static variables is not trivial and has been dealt with differently in studies to date. Alternative methods include using the static variables as masks, including them as independent explanatory variables in the model, or excluding them altogether. 2.Using a set of simulated species, we tested various methods for combining static variables with future climate scenarios. Our results showed that including static variables in the model with the dynamic variables performed better or no worse than either masking or excluding the static variables. 3.The difference in predictive ability was most pronounced when there is an interaction between the static and dynamic variables. 4.For variables such as land use, our results indicate that if such variables affect species distributions, including them in the model is better than excluding them, even though this may mean making the unrealistic assumption that the variable will not change in the future. 5.These results demonstrate the importance of including static and dynamic non-climate variables in addition to climate variables in species distribution models designed to predict future change in a species' habitat or distribution as a result of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Conservationists are increasingly relying on distribution models to predict where species are likely to occur, especially in poorly-surveyed but biodiverse areas. Modeling is challenging in these cases because locality data necessary for model formation are often scarce and spatially imprecise. To identify methods best suited to modeling in these conditions, we compared the success of three algorithms (Maxent, Mahalanobis Typicalities and Random Forests) at predicting distributions of eight bird and eight mammal species endemic to the eastern slopes of the central Andes. We selected study species to have a range of locality sample sizes representative of the data available for endemic species of this region and also that vary in their distribution characteristics. We found that for species that are known from moderate numbers (N = 38-94) of localities, the three methods performed similarly for species with restricted distributions but Maxent and Random Forests yielded better results for species with wider distributions. For species with small numbers of sample localities (N = 5-21), Maxent produced the most consistently successful results, followed by Random Forests and then Mahalanobis Typicalities. Because evaluation statistics for models derived from few localities can be suspect due to the poor spatial representation of the evaluation data, we corroborated these results with review by scientists familiar with the species in the field. Overall, Maxent appears to be the most capable method for modeling distributions of Andean bird and mammal species because of the consistency of results in varying conditions, although the other methods have strengths in certain situations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Predicting the probability of successful establishment and invasion of alien species at global scale, by matching climatic and land use data, is a priority for the risk assessment. Both large- and local-scale factors contribute to the outcome of invasions, and should be integrated to improve the predictions. At global scale, we used climatic and land use layers to evaluate the habitat suitability for the American bullfrog Rana catesbeiana, a major invasive species that is among the causes of amphibian decline. Environmental models were built by using Maxent, a machine learning method. Then, we integrated global data with information on richness of native communities and hunting pressure collected at the local scale. Global-scale data allowed us to delineate the areas with the highest suitability for this species. Predicted suitability was significantly related to the invasiveness observed for bullfrog populations historically introduced in Europe, but did not explain a large portion of variability in invasion success. The integration of data at the global and local scales greatly improved the performance of models, and explained {\textgreater} 57{\%} of the variance in introduction success: bullfrogs were more invasive in areas with high suitability and low hunting pressure over frogs. Our study identified the climatic factors entailing the risk of invasion by bullfrogs, and stresses the importance of the integration of biotic and abiotic data collected at different spatial scales, to evaluate the areas where monitoring and management efforts need to be focused. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

Such is the case with the at least 10 species of Tamarix, which are invading riparian systems in the western United States and expanding their range throughout North America. In 2006, we developed a National Tamarisk Map by using a compilation of presence and absence locations with remotely sensed data and statistical modeling techniques. Since the publication of that work, our database of Tamarix distributions has grown significantly. Using the updated database of species occurrence, new predictor variables, and the maximum entropy (Maxent) model, we have revised our potential Tamarix distribution map for the western United States. Distance-to-water was the strongest predictor in the model (58.1{\%}), while mean temperature of the warmest quarter was the second best predictor (18.4{\%}). Model validation, averaged from 25 model iterations, indicated that our analysis had strong predictive performance (AUC = 0.93) and that the extent of Tamarix distributions is much greater than previously thought. The southwestern United States had the greatest suitable habitat, and this result differed from the 2006 model. Our work highlights the utility of iterative modeling for invasive species habitat modeling as new information becomes available. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Potential habitat modeling of endemic species is an appropriate method to maintain biodiversity, ecosystem function and rehabilitation of rangeland ecosystems. Astragalus caragana, A. cyclophyllon and A. podolobus are endemic in Iran's rangelands and some neighboring countries. The three native species could endure environmental stresses due to their distinctive ecophysiological characteristics. They play important roles in sustainable pastures production, recreation and improvement. They suffer severe threat from many factors including; grazing, agriculture and invasive exotic species. We analyzed the potential habitat of three native plant species in central Iran basing on the grid map with the resolution of 1-km. We used inventory records from field surveys, herbarium collections and 22 environmental factors to explore the environmental influences on given species distribution by Maximum entropy (Maxent) model. Maxent is a species distribution model that uses species occurrence and environmental data for predicting potential species. The results of our study indicated species occurrence has strong correlation with environmental factors such as mean temperature of wettest season, elevation and precipitation of coldest season. We evaluated the model accuracy by AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) based on an independent test data set. AUC values indicated the high power of Maxent to create potential habitat map (AUCA. caragana=0.988, AUCA. cyclophyllon=0.927, AUCA. podolobus=0.923). It is important to consider that AUC values tend to be lower for species that have broad distribution scope, such as A. podolobus distribution. Most suitable potential habitat distributions of the three species were predicted in the western and southwestern parts of rangelands in Isfahan province. Visual comparisons of the actual distribution map of the three species with produced Maxent maps represent a good agreement. In general, the model demonstrated that the occurrence of the given species is highly probable when the elevation is between 2,200 and 3,000 m and mean temperature of wettest season less than 3°C. This model, therefore, can be applied to recognize potential sites for rangeland reclamation projects. {\textcopyright} 2015, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer - Verlag GmbH.},

Till now, Leishmania infantum has been detected from five species of sand flies in the country including Phlebotomus kandelakii, Phlebotomus major s.l., Phlebotomus perfiliewi, Phlebotomus alexandri and Phlebotomus tobbi. Also, Phlebotomus keshishiani was found to be infected with Leishmania parasites. This study aimed at predicting the probable niches and distribution of vectors of visceral leishmaniasis in Iran. Data on spatial distribution studies of sand flies were obtained from Iranian database on sand flies. Sample points were included in data from faunistic studies on sand flies conducted during 1995-2013. MaxEnt software was used to predict the appropriate ecological niches for given species, using climatic and topographical data. Distribution maps were prepared and classified in ArcGIS to find main ecological niches of the vectors and hot spots for VL transmission in Iran. Phlebotomus kandelakii, Ph. major s.l. and Ph. alexandri seem to have played a more important role in VL transmission in Iran, so this study focuses on them. Representations of MaxEnt model for probability of distribution of the studied sand flies showed high contribution of climatological and topographical variables to predict the potential distribution of three vector species. Isothermality was found to be an environmental variable with the highest gain when used in isolation for Ph. kandelakii and Ph. major s.l., while for Ph. alexandri, the most effective variable was precipitation of the coldest quarter. The results of this study present the first prediction on distribution of sand fly vectors of VL in Iran. The predicted distributions were matched with the disease-endemic areas in the country, while it was found that there were some unaffected areas with the potential transmission. More comprehensive studies are recommended on the ecology and vector competence of VL vectors in the country. {\textcopyright} 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract = {Larch caterpillar (Dendrolimus superans Butler) is one of the most common defoliators in the forests of Great Xing' an Mountains. Modeling the spatial distribution and elucidating its occurrence mechanisms at landscape scales are of high importance for regional prevention and management of this forest pest. In this research, we analyzed the historical larch caterpillar occurrence data observed during 2008-2012 at the stand level across three forestry bureaus of Great Xing' an Mountains. We used generalized linear model (GLM) and maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to predict spatial distribution of larch caterpillar under the influences of a suite of environmental variables representing site conditions and forest stand structure. We also assessed the marginal effect and relative importance of those environmental variables. The results showed that both GLM and MaxEnt models produced good predictions. Although the spatial distribution patterns of the potential larch caterpillar occurrence probability derived from the two models were similar, there were clear differences in pest-prone areas when setting various probability thresholds. Elevation, stand age, soil thickness and larch proportion in a stand were important environmental variables in determining larch caterpillar distribution. Our results indicated that the larch caterpillar might have the highest occurrence probability in the area where the elevation was around 300 m and forest was young or in the middle-age group. The occurrence probability tended to be higher in the stands with a thinner soil layer. Larch proportion in a stand exhibited a positive but nonlinear relationship with the pest occurrence probability. {\textcopyright} 2016, editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

The present study analyzed the potential impact of climate change on the geographical distribution of suitable areas for tamarind (Tamarindus indica L.), an economically important UAFT species. Presence records of the species were collected and combined with bioclimatic data derived from the Worldclim data base and from soil type data. The Maximum Entropy Modeling principle (MAXENT) was used in combination with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to forecast current and future (horizon 2050) suitable habitats for the cultivation and conservation of the species. Three different climate models were used for future predictions (the CCCMA, HadCM3 and CSIRO models) under IPCC scenario A2. Under current conditions, 65{\%} of the national area and 87{\%} of the national protected area network were found to be highly suitable for the cultivation and conservation of local tamarind ecotypes, respectively. It is possible that an increase in rainfall (CCCMA and HadCM3 models) will convert the currently highly suitable zones (semi-arid and subhumid dry) into poorly suitable areas at horizon 2050. A decline in precipitation (CSIRO model) could also convert the currently poorly suitable zones (sub-humid humid) into highly suitable zones. In the case of an aridification of the climate (CSIRO), cultivation and conservation of tamarind could become possible all over Benin and/or require the introduction of ecotypes from more arid areas. The predictive capacity of climatic models is constantly improving and it is therefore recommended that such studies be undertaken in order to better inform decision making for the optimum use of UAFT species.},

abstract = {Many studies have identified climate warming to be among the most important threats to biodiversity. Climate change is expected to have stronger effects on species with low genetic diversity, ectothermic physiology, small ranges, low effective populations sizes, specific habitat requirements and limited dispersal capabilities. Despite an ever-increasing number of studies reporting climate change-induced range shifts, few of these have incorporated species' specific dispersal constraints into their models. Moreover, the impacts of climate change on genetic variation within populations and species have rarely been assessed, while this is a promising direction for future research. Here we explore the effects of climate change on the potential distribution and genetic variation of the endemic Pyrenean newt Calotriton asper over the period 2020–2080. We use species distribution modelling in combination with high-resolution gridded climate data while subsequently applying four different dispersal scenarios. We furthermore use published data on genetic variation of both mtDNA and AFLP loci to test whether populations with high genetic diversity (nucleotide diversity and expected heterozygosity) or evolutionary history (unique haplotypes and K clusters) have an increased extinction risk from climate change. The present study indicates that climate change drastically reduces the potential distribution range of C. asper and reveals dispersal possibilities to be minimal under the most realistic dispersal scenarios. Despite the major loss in suitable climate, the models highlight relatively large stable areas throughout the species core distribution area indicating persistence of populations over time. The results, however, show a major loss of genetic diversity and evolutionary history. This highlights the importance of accounting for intraspecific genetic variation in climate change impact studies. Likewise, the integration of species' specific dispersal constraints into projections of species distribution models is an important step to fully explore the effects of climate change on species potential distributions. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Aim: Techniques that predict species potential distributions by combining observed occurrence records with environmental variables show much potential for application across a range of biogeographical analyses. Some of the most promising applications relate to species for which occurrence records are scarce, due to cryptic habits, locally restricted distributions or low sampling effort. However, the minimum sample sizes required to yield useful predictions remain difficult to determine. Here we developed and tested a novel jackknife validation approach to assess the ability to predict species occurrence when fewer than 25 occurrence records are available. Location: Madagascar. Methods: Models were developed and evaluated for 13 species of secretive leaf-tailed geckos (Uroplatus spp.) that are endemic to Madagascar, for which available sample sizes range from 4 to 23 occurrence localities (at 1 km2 grid resolution). Predictions were based on 20 environmental data layers and were generated using two modelling approaches: a method based on the principle of maximum entropy (Maxent) and a genetic algorithm (GARP). Results: We found high success rates and statistical significance in jackknife tests with sample sizes as low as five when the Maxent model was applied. Results for GARP at very low sample sizes (less than c. 10) were less good. When sample sizes were experimentally reduced for those species with the most records, variability among predictions using different combinations of localities demonstrated that models were greatly influenced by exactly which observations were included. Main conclusions: We emphasize that models developed using this approach with small sample sizes should be interpreted as identifying regions that have similar environmental conditions to where the species is known to occur, and not as predicting actual limits to the range of a species. The jackknife validation approach proposed here enables assessment of the predictive ability of models built using very small sample sizes, although use of this test with larger sample sizes may lead to overoptimistic estimates of predictive power. Our analyses demonstrate that geographical predictions developed from small numbers of occurrence records may be of great value, for example in targeting field surveys to accelerate the discovery of unknown populations and species. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

abstract = {Ten species of parthenogenetic broad-nosed weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Entiminae) native to Argentina, southern Brazil, and Uruguay were selected for niche modeling analysis based on climatic data and altitude, to evaluate their potential range expansion inside and outside South America. The selected species belong to five genera of the tribe Naupactini affecting economically important crops. Until present, five of the 10 species analyzed here have invaded prairies and steppes of countries outside South America (Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, United States, and South Africa) : Aramigus tessellatus (Say), Atrichonotussordidus (Hustache), Atrichonotus taeniatulus (Berg), Naupactus leucoloma Boheman, and Naupactus peregrinus (Buchanan). Our niche modeling analyses performed with MAXENT demonstrated that these areas would be also suitable for Aramigus conirostris (Hustache), Eurymetopus fallax (Boheman), Pantomorus auripes Hustache, Pantomorus ruizi (Br{\`{e}}thes), and Pantomorus viridisquamosus (Boheman), consequently, they also have the potential to invade areas outside their native ranges, mainly in southeastern United States, some European countries (e.g., Portugal, France, and southern England), South Africa, New Zealand, and southeastern Australia. All the studied species share similar environmental requirements, the most important variables being the Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter, the Annual Mean Temperature and Isothermality. Long distance dispersal through commercial trade, and parthenogenetic reproduction would increase the threat of these weevils to crop production worldwide. {\textcopyright} 2013 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract = {China's South to North Water Diversion (SNWD) project connects portions of the Yangtze River in the south to the Yellow River system in the north, overcoming biogeographic barriers to water movement. The diversion will supply potable water to over 110 million people and provide multiple other socioeconomic benefits. However, an inadvertent negative impact of this connection includes creation of conduits for species invasions. Alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides), water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), and water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) are the only aquatic plant species on China's shortlists for special control. These species are mainly invasive in the Yangtze River basin. If these species are able to invade the SNWD and further spread via the SNWD, they have the potential to alter water supply, including water quantity and quality, as well as local ecology and agriculture, threatening the goals of the diversion. Understanding the full potential for these species to invade northern China is critical to early management decisions to avoid costly negative impacts. We used Maxent modeling to evaluate the probability that each of these species might become invasive in the receiving water regions. The models predict that all three species will be able to expand their ranges northward, with alligator weed and water hyacinth having the greatest potential for range expansion. These results suggest the need for prevention, monitoring, and management strategies for these species to reduce the risk and costs of impacts. {\textcopyright} 2017 American Chemical Society.},

We illustrate a number of improvements to MAXENT that follow from these relations. In particular, a point process model approach facilitates methods for choosing the appropriate spatial resolution, assessing model adequacy, and choosing the LASSO penalty parameter, all currently unavailable to MAXENT.

abstract = {Wind energy development is rapidly increasing within breeding and wintering ranges of many grassland birds in North America. Despite recognized environmental benefits of such development, wind farms have the potential to negatively impact bird communities. Using an area-search method, we surveyed grassland birds within a matrix of pastures, hay fields, and agricultural lands at a wind facility in north-central Texas during the winters of 2009/10 and 2010/11. We used binary logistic regression to examine the effect of distance from wind turbines on plot occupancy for species that did not show significant habitat associations. In contrast, for species with significant habitat associations, we used a two-step process to test for displacement. First, we identified suitable plots using a niche modeling approach in Maxent. Second, we used binary logistic regression to examine whether distance to turbine influenced the occupancy of those plots. Sprague's Pipit Anthus spragueii, Savannah Sparrow Passerculus sandwichensis, and meadowlarks Sturnella sp. showed no evidence for displacement. In contrast, the Le Conte's Sparrow Ammodramus leconteii, was significantly more likely to occupy suitable plots as distance from the nearest turbine increased. Mean plot occupancy for the Le Conte's Sparrow was more than four times lower in plots {\textless}200 m from the nearest wind turbine compared to those that were {\textgreater}400 m away. Our study highlights the need to investigate displacement at the level of individual species. Our data also suggest that species dependent on cryptic predator evasion strategies may be displaced from wind turbines and this idea warrants further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {The benefits provided by underutilised fruit tree species such as baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) in combating increasing malnutrition and poverty become more apparent as awareness grows regarding concerns of climate change and food security. Due to its multiple uses, its high nutritional and medicinal value, drought tolerance and relatively easy cultivation, baobab has been identified as one of the most important edible forest trees to be conserved, domesticated and valued in Africa. In order to contribute towards the cultivation of the species, suitability of sites in Africa and worldwide was evaluated for potential cultivation using species' locality data and spatial environmental data in MAXENT modelling framework. A total of 450 geo-referenced records of the baobab tree were assembled from herbarium records, commercial firm's databases and fieldwork for modelling site suitability for global cultivation of the baobab tree. Climatic and topographic data were acquired from the Worldclim data while soil data was obtained from the Harmonized World Soil Database. MAXENT was found to be a successful modelling method for studying cultivation potential. The main variables that contributed towards predicting baobab's global cultivation potential were annual precipitation and temperature seasonality. Results suggest that baobab tree could be widely cultivated in most countries in southern Africa and in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa from Senegal to Sudan. Angola and Somalia were found to be highly suitable for cultivating baobab in Africa. Model suggests, India, where the baobab tree already exists and is used, to be the most suitable country for baobab cultivation outside Africa. North-west Australia, Madagascar, north-east Brazil and Mexico resulted to be other suitable places for cultivating the tree species. Although it is recommended model results be validated with in situ seedling experiments, there seems to be a great potential for the cultivation of this species globally. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Species distribution modeling, in combination with databases of specimen distribution records, is advocated as a solution to the problem of distributional data limitation in biogeography and ecology. The global biodiversity information facility (GBIF), a portal that collates digitized collection and survey data, is the largest online provider of distribution records. However, all distributional databases are spatially biassed due to uneven effort of sampling, data storage and mobilization. Such bias is particularly pronounced in GBIF, where nation-wide differences in funding and data sharing lead to huge differences in contribution to GBIF.We use a common Eurasian butterfly ( Aglais urticae) as an exemplar taxon to provide evidence that range model quality is decreasing due to the spatial clustering of distributional records in GBIF. Furthermore, we show that such loss of model quality would go unnoticed with standard methods of model quality evaluation. Using evaluations of model predictions of the Swiss distribution of the species, we compare distribution models of full data with data where a subsampling procedure removes spatial bias at the cost of record numbers, but not of spatial extent of records. We show that data with less spatial bias produce better predictive models even though they are based on less input data. Our subsampling routine may therefore be a suitable method to reduce the impact of spatial bias to species distribution models.Our results warn of automatized applications of species distribution models to distributional databases (as has been advocated and implemented), as internal model evaluation did not show the decline of model quality with increased spatial bias (but rather the opposite) while expert evaluation clearly did.{\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Many Antipatharia are habitat for associates, have extreme longevity and some species can occur beyond 8500. m depth. As they are major constituents of'coral gardens', which are Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs), knowledge of their distribution and environmental requirements is an important pre-requisite for informed conservation planning particularly where the expense and difficulty of deep-sea sampling prohibits comprehensive surveys.This study uses a global database of Antipatharia distribution data to perform habitat suitability modelling using the Maxent methodology to estimate the global extent of black coral habitat suitability. The model of habitat suitability is driven by temperature but there is notable influence from other variables of topography, surface productivity and oxygen levels.This model can be used to predict areas of suitable habitat, which can be useful for conservation planning. The global distribution of Antipatharia habitat suitability shows a marked contrast with the distribution of specimen observations, indicating that many potentially suitable areas have not been sampled, and that sampling effort has been disproportionate to shallow, accessible areas inside marine protected areas (MPAs). Although 25{\%} of Antipatharia observations are located in MPAs, only 7-8{\%} of predicted suitable habitat is protected, which is short of the Convention on Biological Diversity target to protect 10{\%} of ocean habitats by 2020. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background and aims – Ecological niche conservatism describes the tendency of phylogenetically related species to maintain the characteristics of their ancestral fundamental niches. Our aim was to assess niche conservatism of species belonging to two plant genera of the Family Asteraceae endemic to Mexico: Dyscritothamnus includes two woody species restricted to the dry scrublands of central Mexico and Loxothysanus includes two herbaceous species distributed mostly in temperate environments from central Mexico southward. Methods – Using geographical distribution data of species obtained from critically reviewed herbarium specimens (45 of Dyscritothamnus and 94 of Loxothysanus), niche models were obtained using the Maxent program. The climatic variables evaluated were chosen using principal component analysis. Subsequently, with the program ENMTools we quantified the degree of overlap and similarity between the niches of congeneric species using the equivalence (D) and similarity (I) parameters. Key results – The two species of Dyscritothamnus are sympatric, influenced by common environmental features; accordingly, their niches show high equivalence values (D = 0.563), suggesting niche conservatism. On the other hand, the genus Loxothysanus shows a wider geographical distribution; their species niches are not equivalent (D = 0.145) and have a relatively low value of environmental similarity. Conclusion – The distributions of the species of Dyscritothamnus support the hypothesis of niche conservatism because of their sisterhood and quite similar distribution patterns that result in high niche conservatism values. In contrast, species of Loxothysanus do not support clearly such a hypothesis, suggesting their niches have suffered adaptive changes to contrasting environments. {\textcopyright} 2015 Botanic Garden Meise and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.},

Study area: Azores (S{\~{a}}o Miguel, Pico, Terceira and Flores islands). Methods: Information from 139 plots set up in the best preserved vegetation patches was used. Ward's agglomerative clustering method was applied in order to identify community types. Potential distribution of these community-level entities was modeled in relation to climatic predictors, using MAXENT. Results: Eight vegetation belts were identified: Erica-Morella Coastal Woodlands, Picconia-Morella Lowland Forests, Laurus Submontane Forests, Juniperus- Ilex Montane Forests, Juniperus Montane Woodlands, Calluna-Juniperus Altimontane Scrublands, Calluna- Erica Subalpine Scrublands and Calluna Alpine Scrublands. Modeling results suggest that Picconia-Morella and Laurus forests (Laurel forests) are the potential dominant vegetation in the Azores. With the possible exception of Juniperus woodlands, Pico could have all vegetation types, in contrast with Santa Maria, Graciosa and Corvo with only three. Conclusions: Most of Azorean natural vegetation has been transformed or degraded by human action, with a greater impact on Laurel forests. The best preserved vegetation belts are located above 600 m a.s.l., including Juniperus-Ilex Forests and Juniperus Woodlands, perhaps the only example of island montane cloud forests existing outside the tropics. In the present work, for the first time we used a statistical method to classify zonal vegetation, gave it a bioclimatic foundation and applied it to the whole archipelago, thus defining and describing the main vegetation belts of the Azores.

abstract = {In this paper we explore new options for model selection in the distribution modelling method MaxEnt, offered by the strict maximum likelihood explanation of the method. These options, which are collectively referred to as the 'alternative MaxEnt procedure' (aMp), imply manual forward stepwise selection of variables and an F-ratio test to compare nested models. We compared aMp models with models obtained by the default variable transformation and model selection procedures in the popular Maxent.jar software ('default MaxEnt procedure'; dMp), which invokes ℓ1-regularisation. We used swamp-forest presence in SE Norway as the target for our modelling. Eleven terrain variables derived from a LiDAR-based digital elevation map, making up three groups of internally correlated variables, were used as predictors in the models. An independently collected presence/absence 'test' data set was used for evaluation of models. Although dMp models were much more complex than aMp models, with up to 240 variables derived from the original 11, compared to a maximum number of derived variables in aMp models of 14, no significant difference in performance between dMp and aMp models was found. This indicates that the regularisation procedure is not the main reason for the good performance of MaxEnt (as implemented in Maxent.jar) in comparative studies. Advantages of the more flexible aMp procedure, which produces simpler models, are discussed. Effects of spatial autocorrelation in the response variable on modelling results were addressed by obtaining parallel MaxEnt models for two response variables that differ in the number of presence observations: the centroid of the 121 swamp forests and the 7175 grid cells, each 5 m × 5 m, in which swamp forest was recorded as present. Our results are not conclusive with respect to the effect of spatial autocorrelation in the response variable on the predictive performance of distribution models by MaxEnt. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aim We used abiotic environmental variables and historical locality records to infer distributions of endangered anuran species of Costa Rica to promote efficient strategies for future amphibian surveys. Location Costa Rica. Methods We used a Maximum Entropy Algorithm (Maxent) to predict potential distribution maps for 17 species of endangered anurans and create a consensus map of species richness. We compared the environmental conditions from localities where relictual amphibian populations were recently rediscovered with the conditions across their historical range to evaluate the possibility that these relictual populations might occur in specific climatic conditions that could explain their persistence. We used a multicriteria analysis considering the following factors: the intersection zones between the consensus map, conservation areas, potential Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) distribution, collecting effort and areas within the precipitation range at which reappearances had occurred to locate sites for future surveys. Results The resulting predictions suggest that suitable areas for the highest number of species occur between 1300 and 2500m.a.s.l and are concentrated along the Pacific slopes of the Cordillera de Talamanca and Cordillera Volc{\'{a}}nica Central. Around 45{\%} of the high potential richness area is under protection. Relictual populations of declined species seem to persist mainly in highly humid localities (2500-3500mm of mean annual precipitation). Around 240km 2 has an ideal environment for the rediscovery of relictual populations. The multicriteria analysis showed that around 0.5{\%} of the Costa Rican territory should be surveyed exhaustively for frogs. Main conclusions Many of the potential refugia we identified here have not been surveyed since 2000, the areas identified by the best model predictions correspond well with the localities of the relictual populations recently reported. We suggest future surveys of missing amphibian species should focus on these areas. The discovery of populations of endangered species can be used to propose conservation areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {International targets have committed governments to expanding the global protected area (PA) network to 17{\%} of the terrestrial surface by 2020. Optimising PA placement in the landscape is challenging due to a poor knowledge of biodiversity distribution and multiple definitions of conservation value. We explore these two issues using a case study of a highly threatened bird Order in a region of conservation concern where PA network effectiveness for biodiversity has not been formally explored previously. To determine if the existing PA network protects the most important areas for 24 species of Himalayan Galliformes, we use a novel method to compare the current network placement to results produced from Zonation prioritisation software and modelled species distributions. Specifically, we identify areas of high species richness and then weight maps by three different species specific conservation values. The current PA network captures ranges poorly. We found statistically significantly poorer fits between the optimal and the existing placement of the Himalayan PA network for Zonation results that were: (i) unweighted; (ii) weighted by Red List score; and (iii) weighted by endemism to the Himalaya. Across these and two other Zonation results, the placement of the optimal PA network covered 58{\%} more of Galliformes distributions than the existing network. We advocate some refinements to the existing PA network to maximise Galliformes coverage and suggest that our method could be used to model the optimal PA network for a wide range of species and/or regions, something which will support the assessment and attainment of CBD targets. {\textcopyright} 2016.Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The prediction of species distribution has become a focus in ecology. For predicting a result more effectively and accurately, some novel methods have been proposed recently, like support vector machine (SVM) and maximum entropy (MAXENT). However, high complexity in the forest, like that in Taiwan, will make the modeling become even harder. In this study, we aim to explore which method is more applicable to species distribution modeling in the complex forest. Castanopsis carlesii (long-leaf chinkapin, LLC), growing widely in Taiwan, was chosen as the target species because its seeds are an important food source for animals. We overlaid the tree samples on the layers of altitude, slope, aspect, terrain position, and vegetation index derived from SOPT-5 images, and developed three models, MAXENT, SVM, and decision tree (DT), to predict the potential habitat of LLCs. We evaluated these models by two sets of independent samples in different site and the effect on the complexity of forest by changing the background sample size (BSZ). In the forest with low complex (small BSZ), the accuracies of SVM (kappa = 0.87) and DT (0.86) models were slightly higher than that of MAXENT (0.84). In the more complex situation (large BSZ), MAXENT kept high kappa value (0.85), whereas SVM (0.61) and DT (0.57) models dropped significantly due to limiting the habitat close to samples. Therefore, MAXENT model was more applicable to predict species' potential habitat in the complex forest; whereas SVM and DT models would tend to underestimate the potential habitat of LLCs.},

abstract = {Maximum entropy principle (MaxEnt) is usually used for estimating the probability density function under specified moment constraints. The density function is then integrated to obtain the cumulative distribution function, which needs to be inverted to obtain a quantile corresponding to some specified probability. In such analysis, consideration of higher ordermoments is important for accurate modelling of the distribution tail. There are three drawbacks for this conventional methodology: (1) Estimates of higher order ({\textgreater}2) moments from a small sample of data tend to be highly biased; (2) It can merely cope with problems with complete or noncensored samples; (3) Only probability weighted moments of integer orders have been utilized. These difficulties inevitably induce bias and inaccuracy of the resultant quantile estimates and therefore have been the main impediments to the application of the MaxEnt Principle in extreme quantile estimation. This paper attempts to overcome these problems and presents a distribution free method for estimating the quantile function of a non-negative randomvariable using the principle of maximum partial entropy subject to constraints of the partial probability weighted moments estimated from censored sample. The main contributions include: (1) New concepts, i.e., partial entropy, fractional partial probability weighted moments, and partial Kullback-Leibler measure are elegantly defined; (2) Maximum entropy principle is re-formulated to be constrained by fractional partial probability weighted moments; (3) New distribution free quantile functions are derived. Numerical analyses are performed to assess the accuracy of extreme value estimates computed from censored samples. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

Anticipating the areas of potential VHSV occurrence is key to designing epidemiological surveillance and disease prevention strategies in the Great Lakes basin. We explored the environmental features that could shape the distribution of VHSV, based on remote sensing and climate data via ecological niche modelling. Variables included temperature measured during the day and night, precipitation, vegetation, bathymetry, solar radiation and topographic wetness. VHSV occurrences were obtained from available reports of virus confirmation in laboratory facilities. We fit a Maxent model using VHSV-IVb reports and environmental variables under different parameterizations to identify the best model to determine potential VHSV occurrence based on environmental suitability. VHSV reports were generated from both passive and active surveillance. VHSV occurrences were most abundant near shore sites. We were, however, able to capture the environmental signature of VHSV based on the environmental variables employed in our model, allowing us to identify patterns of VHSV potential occurrence. Our findings suggest that VHSV is not at an ecological equilibrium and more areas could be affected, including areas not in close geographic proximity to past VHSV reports. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Accurate assessment of insect pest establishment risk is needed by national plant protection organizations to negotiate international trade of horticultural commodities that can potentially carry the pests and result in inadvertent introductions in the importing countries. We used mechanistic and correlative niche models to quantify and map the global patterns of the potential for establishment of codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.), a major pest of apples, peaches, pears, and other pome and stone fruits, and a quarantine pest in countries where it currently does not occur. The mechanistic model CLIMEX was calibrated using species-specific physiological tolerance thresholds, whereas the correlative model MaxEnt used species occurrences and climatic spatial data. Projected potential distribution from both models conformed well to the current known distribution of codling moth. None of the models predicted suitable environmental conditions in countries located between 20°N and 20°S potentially because of shorter photoperiod, and lack of chilling requirement ({\textless}60 d at ≤10°C) in these areas for codling moth to break diapause. Models predicted suitable conditions in South Korea and Japan where codling moth currently does not occur but where its preferred host species (i.e., apple) is present. Average annual temperature and latitude were the main environmental variables associated with codling moth distribution at global level. The predictive models developed in this study present the global risk of establishment of codling moth, and can be used for monitoring potential introductions of codling moth in different countries and by policy makers and trade negotiators in making science-based decisions. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2015.

The state of Esp{\'{i}}rito Santo (ES), an endemic area in southeast Brazil, has shown a considerably high prevalence in recent decades. Environmental niche modelling (ENM) is a useful tool for predicting potential disease risk. In this study, ENM was applied to sand fly species and CL cases in ES to identify the principal vector and risk areas of the disease. Sand flies were collected in 466 rural localities between 1997 and 2013 using active and passive capture. Insects were identified to the species level, and the localities were georeferenced. Twenty-one bioclimatic variables were selected from WorldClim. Maxent was used to construct models projecting the potential distribution for five Lutzomyia species and CL cases. ENMTools was used to overlap the species and the CL case models. The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed, adopting a 5{\%} significance level. Approximately 250,000 specimens were captured, belonging to 43 species. The area under the curve (AUC) was considered acceptable for all models. The slope was considered relevant to the construction of the models for all the species identified. The overlay test identified Lutzomyia intermedia as the main vector of CL in southeast Brazil. ENM tools enable an analysis of the association among environmental variables, vector distributions and CL cases, which can be used to support epidemiologic and entomological vigilance actions to control the expansion of CL in vulnerable areas. {\textcopyright} 2016 Meneguzzi et al.

abstract = {The Mascarene ridged frog, Ptychadena mascareniensis, is a species complex that includes numerous lineages occurring mostly in humid savannas and open forests of mainland Africa, Madagascar, the Seychelles, and the Mascarene Islands. Sampling across this broad distribution presents an opportunity to examine the genetic differentiation within this complex and to investigate how the evolution of bioclimatic niches may have shaped current biogeographic patterns. Using model-based phylogenetic methods and molecular-clock dating, we constructed a time-calibrated molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the group based on mitochondrial 16S rRNA and cytochrome b (cytb) genes and the nuclear RAG1 gene from 173 individuals. Haplotype networks were reconstructed and species boundaries were investigated using three species-delimitation approaches: Bayesian generalized mixed Yule-coalescent model (bGMYC), the Poisson Tree Process model (PTP) and a cluster algorithm (SpeciesIdentifier). Estimates of similarity in bioclimatic niche were calculated from species-distribution models (MAXENT) and multivariate statistics (Principal Component Analysis, Discriminant Function Analysis). Ancestral-area reconstructions were performed on the phylogeny using probabilistic approaches implemented in BioGeoBEARS. We detected high levels of genetic differentiation yielding ten distinct lineages or operational taxonomic units, and Central Africa was found to be a diversity hotspot for these frogs. Most speciation events took place throughout the Miocene, including “out-of-Africa” overseas dispersal events to Madagascar in the East and to S{\~{a}}o Tom{\'{e}} in the West. Bioclimatic niche was remarkably well conserved, with most species tolerating similar temperature and rainfall conditions common to the Central African region. The P. mascareniensis complex provides insights into how bioclimatic niche shaped the current biogeographic patterns with niche conservatism being exhibited by the Central African radiation and niche divergence shaping populations in West Africa and Madagascar. Central Africa, including the Albertine Rift region, has been an important center of diversification for this species complex. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors},

The Maxent models are effective in predicting potential terrace distributions and reveal systematic differences between ancient and modern terrace arrays in the study area. Surface geology played a key role in predicting ancient terrace locations, but contributed much less substantially in modeling modern terraces, whose locations were influenced strongly by topography.

abstract = {Environmental niche modeling (ENM) is commonly used to develop probabilistic maps of species distribution. Among available ENM techniques, MaxEnt has become one of the most popular tools for modeling species distribution, with hundreds of peerreviewed articles published each year. MaxEnt's popularity is mainly due to the use of a graphical interface and automatic parameter configuration capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that using the default automatic configuration may not be always appropriate because it can produce non-optimal models; particularly when dealing with a small number of species presence points. Thus, the recommendation is to evaluate the best potential combination of parameters (feature classes and regularization multiplier) to select the most appropriate model. In this work we reviewed 244 articles published between 2013 and 2015 to assess whether researchers are following recommendations to avoid using the default parameter configuration when dealing with small sample sizes, or if they are using MaxEnt as a ''black box tool.'' Our results show that in only 16{\%} of analyzed articles authors evaluated best feature classes, in 6.9{\%} evaluated best regularization multipliers, and in a meager 3.7{\%} evaluated simultaneously both parameters before producing the definitive distribution model. We analyzed 20 articles to quantify the potential differences in resulting outputs when using software default parameters instead of the alternative best model. Results from our analysis reveal important differences between the use of default parameters and the best model approach, especially in the total area identified as suitable for the assessed species and the specific areas that are identified as suitable by both modelling approaches. These results are worrying, because publications are potentially reporting over-complex or over-simplistic models that can undermine the applicability of their results. Of particular importance are studies used to inform policy making. Therefore, researchers, practitioners, reviewers and editors need to be very judicious when dealing with MaxEnt, particularly when the modelling process is based on small sample sizes. {\textcopyright} 2017 Morales et al.},

For doing this we used the Species Distribution Modeling (DEM), generating potential areas in Australia and projecting them to Brazil in the present and future climate scenarios, using the concept of maximum entropy (Maxent 3.3.3k). We considered 70 sites of natural occurrence of E. grandis in Australia and seven bioclimatic variables, as follows: mean annual temperature, variation of annual temperature, annual precipitation, precipitation of wettest month, precipitation of driest month, variation of rainfall and altitude. The modeling of the current climate considered the period from 1950 to 2000. The climatic projections were considered as the A1B scenario and the HadCM3 model for three periods: 2010-2039, 2040-2069 and 2070-2099. All models were significant (p {\textless} 0.001); showed high AUC values ({\textgreater} 0.95) and low omission errors. The favorable areas for E. grandis at the present time was approximately 1.500.000 km2, concentrating on southern, southeastern and midwestern Brazil. When we simulated future climates, the area decreased by 2.8, 4.7 and 3.8{\%} for the scenarios 2010-2039, 2040-2069 and 2070-2099, respectively. The major changes were the decrease in the southeastern region and increase in the northern region. The modeling showed a decrease in the area when considering the future scenarios. Although new areas have been identified as suitable areas, there was a decrease of already known as suitable areas. The use of modeling can be useful in planning the breeding and expansion of genetic material to new areas, and assist in identifying areas in which eucalypt culture becomes more vulnerable to climate, disease and pests.},

abstract = {Aim Elucidating the environmental limits of coral reefs is central to projecting future impacts of climate change on these ecosystems and their global distribution. Recent developments in species distribution modelling (SDM) and the availability of comprehensive global environmental datasets have provided an opportunity to reassess the environmental factors that control the distribution of coral reefs at the global scale as well as to compare the performance of different SDM techniques. Location Shallow waters world-wide. Methods The SDM methods used were maximum entropy (Maxent) and two presence/absence methods: classification and regression trees (CART) and boosted regression trees (BRT). The predictive variables considered included sea surface temperature (SST), salinity, aragonite saturation state ($\Omega$ Arag), nutrients, irradiance, water transparency, dust, current speed and intensity of cyclone activity. For many variables both mean and SD were considered, and at weekly, monthly and annually averaged time-scales. All were transformed to a global 1°×1° grid to generate coral reef probability maps for comparison with known locations. Model performance was compared in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) scores. Potential geographical bias was explored via misclassification maps of false positive and negative errors on test data. Results Boosted regression trees consistently outperformed other methods, although Maxent also performed acceptably. The dominant environmental predictors were the temperature variables (annual mean SST, and monthly and weekly minimum SST), followed by, and with their relative importance differing between regions, nutrients, light availability and $\Omega$ Arag. No systematic bias in SDM performance was found between major coral provinces, but false negatives were more likely for cells containing 'marginal' non-reef-forming coral communities, e.g. Bermuda. Main conclusions Agreement between BRT and Maxent models gives predictive confidence for exploring the environmental limits of coral reef ecosystems at a spatial scale relevant to global climate models (c. 1°×1°). Although SST-related variables dominate the coral reef distribution models, contributions from nutrients, $\Omega$ Arag and light availability were critical in developing models of reef presence in regions such as the Bahamas, South Pacific and Coral Triangle. The steep response in SST-driven probabilities at low temperatures indicates that latitudinal expansion of coral reef habitat is very sensitive to global warming. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Most of the current invasion risk analyses are qualitative and ad hoc based. In this study, we used a spatial statistics based framework to assess the invasion risks of hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) with the following major steps: (1) invasion probability was first predicted by two widely used spatial statistics tools, maximum entropy (Maxent) and Mahalanobis distance (MD), based on known adelgid infestation locations and a set of environmental and anthropogenic related factors; (2) an ensemble of the above two models and a multi-threshold approach were employed to reduce prediction uncertainties; and (3) a spatial hotspot analysis were applied to enhance invasion prevention and management decision making. Among the factors investigated, variables representing corridors (e.g., trails and railroads) that are inadvertently spreading adelgid were important for the prediction of adelgid invasion. Large portion of the hemlock forests in the study area had a high adelgid invasion probability. The hotspot analysis based on the ensemble model showed three major clustered areas with high adelgid infestation probability.

abstract = {ABSTRACT Predicting the potential habitat of species under both current and future climate change scenarios is crucial for monitoring invasive species and understanding a species' response to different environmental conditions. Frequently, the only data available on a species is the location of its occurrence (presence-only data). Using occurrence records only, two models were used to predict the geographical distribution of two destructive invasive termite species, Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann) and Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki. The first model uses a Bayesian linear logistic regression approach adjusted for presence-only data while the second one is the widely used maximum entropy approach (Maxent). Results show that the predicted distributions of both C. gestroi and C. formosanus are strongly linked to urban development. The impact of future scenarios such as climate warming and population growth on the biotic distribution of both termite species was also assessed. Future climate warming seems to affect their projected probability of presence to a lesser extent than population growth. The Bayesian logistic approach outperformed Maxent consistently in all models according to evaluation criteria such as model sensitivity and ecological realism. The importance of further studies for an explicit treatment of residual spatial autocorrelation and a more comprehensive comparison between both statistical approaches is suggested. {\textcopyright} 2014 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract = {Population sizes of wild boar (Sus scrofa) and the damage they cause to crops have been increasing in Japan. Reliable techniques are needed to estimate the potential for damage at the landscape scale. Here, we predict the risk of damage to rice (Oryza sativa) paddies by wild boar in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, by means of three different modelling methods - Maxent, generalised linear model (GLM) and generalised additive model (GAM) - using a combination of presence-only damage data obtained from a local agency and environmental information derived from publicly available databases. We used damage locations in 2007 and 2008. To validate the models, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) and the correct classification rate (CCR) using independent data obtained in field surveys. The three methods gave similar results, indicating that we could construct a predictive model with high accuracy from presence-only data. Among these three, Maxent showed the closest fit, with 0.78 AUC and 72.6{\%} CCR values. Because it is important to estimate the risk of damage to reduce future damage and costs, these damage prediction methods using presence-only data, which administrative agencies can obtain with no cost, this could assist local governments in formulating damage control plans. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Prediction of invasive species spread helps to plan management actions. We performed a risk assessment by quantifying habitat invasibility, predicted the potential distribution of an invasive species using the Maxent modelling program and confirmed patterns using detailed field studies. Our study was conducted in southern Argentina, Patagonia, where large areas are already invaded by the European shrub Rosa rubiginosa. A total of 163 R. rubiginosa locations served as ground truth data, and predictors were obtained from the spaceborne sensor Landsat 5. Based on the Maxent Method (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.8), the habitat invasibility map covered about 5000km2. Our model revealed that R. rubiginosa has the potential to invade 36{\%} of the area along a steep precipitation gradient (target region 600-1400mm per year). The Tasseled Cap brightness index and the normalized vegetation index explained most of the variance in our model, followed by the Tasseled Cap greenness and wetness indices, which can be interpreted as indicators of disturbance. Highest levels of invasibility were predicted for urban areas, along roads and rivers, on pastures, in Austrocedrus chilensis forests and inside Nothofagus dombeyi forest gaps. Detailed field assessments of rose cover performed in seven habitat types supported these results: rose cover significantly decreased with increasing tree cover (P{\textless}0.01). Our data revealed that the occurrence of R. rubiginosa is not connected to a certain habitat type, but that it thrives in open patches following habitat disturbance. Our approach is a widely applicable, cost-free remote sensing method that can serve as a risk assessment tool for alien plant species invasion of habitats. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

In South America, almost all countries have serological evidence of BTV infections, but only four outbreaks of the disease have been reported. Although clinical diseases have never been cited in Argentina, viral activity has been detected in cattle. In this study, we developed a potential distribution map of Culicoides insignis populations in northwestern Argentina using Maximum Entropy Modeling (Maxent). For the analyses, information regarding both data of specimen collections between 2003 and 2013, and climatic and environmental variables was used. Variables selection was based on the ecological relevance in relation to Culicoides spp. biology and distribution in the area. The best Maxent model according to the Jackknife test included 53 C. insignis presence records and precipitation of the warmest quarter, altitude, and precipitation of the wettest month. Accuracy was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC = 0.97). These results provide an important analytical resource of high potential for both the development of suitable control strategies and the assessment of disease transmission risk in the region. {\textcopyright} The Author 2016.

Species distribution models (SDMs) were obtained using the Maximum entropy algorithm. Habitat suitability maps were based on sites of known occurrence of studied species. The study showed that highly reliable habitat prediction models can be obtained through the inclusion of bioclimatic and biogeographic maps when modelling these species. The resultant SDMs are able to fit the search area more closely to the characteristics of the species, excluding the percentage of highly suitable areas that are located far from the known distribution of the taxon, where the probability of finding the plant is low. Therefore, it is possible to overcome one of the most commonly encountered problems in the construction of rare or threatened flora taxa SDMs, derived from the low number of initial citations. The resulting SDMs and the vegetation map enable prioritization of the search for new populations and optimization of the economic and human resources used in the collection of field data. {\textcopyright} 2014 Societ{\`{a}} Botanica Italiana.},

Due to the negative impact of the NWS fly in animal health, expansion of successful NWS fly eradication programmes is under discussion. However, the effects of geography and environmental diversity on NWS population structure and migration patterns need to be assessed before any political decision is made to implement such a programme. We present a GIS tool to construct potential connection corridors among sampling localities based on genetic and environmental data. We integrate, through a home-made python script, a friction raster based on a Maxent niche model and the pairwise $\Phi$ST statistic. Among 38 NWS fly sampling localities from South America, we find a high population connectivity among the sampling localities from the south of the Amazon region. The region along the Atlantic Ocean was identified as the most probable migration corridor between the north (NAG) and the south (SAG) of the Amazon region. The approach highlighted previously undetected population structure within NAG showing low to medium connectivity through the Andes, correlating with current understanding of NWS fly migration in South America. Also, the approach is flexible, allowing future research to incorporate other niche simulations and genetic differentiation metrics. With this flexibility, the tool could become part of any AW-IPM by helping to target regions for control. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Atomic Energy Agency 2014.},

We address the inherent dynamic nature of the problem by explicitly modeling the data as a time series; we show how this representational expressivity fits naturally into a maxent framework.

abstract = {Plague has been established in the western United States (US) since 1900 following the West Coast introduction of commensal rodents infected with Yersinia pestis via early industrial shipping. Over the last century, plague ecology has transitioned through cycles of widespread human transmission, urban domestic transmission among commensal rodents, and ultimately settled into the predominantly sylvan foci that remain today where it is maintained alternatively by enzootic and epizootic transmission. While zoonotic transmission to humans is much less common in modern times, significant plague risk remains in parts of the western US. Moreover, risk to some threatened species that are part of the epizootic cycle can be quite substantive. This investigation attempted to predict the risk of plague across the western US by modeling the ecologic niche of plague in sylvan and domestic animals identified between 2000 and 2015. A Maxent machine learning algorithm was used to predict this niche based on climate, altitude, land cover, and the presence of an important enzootic species, Peromyscus maniculatus. This model demonstrated good predictive ability (AUC D 86{\%}) and identified areas of high risk in central Colorado, north-central New Mexico, and southwestern and northeastern California. The presence of P. maniculatus, altitude, precipitation during the driest and wettest quarters, and distance to artificial surfaces, all contributed substantively to maximizing the gain function. These findings add to the known landscape epidemiology and infection ecology of plague in the western US and may suggest locations of particular risk to be targeted for wild and domestic animal intervention. {\textcopyright} 2015 Walsh and Haseeb.},

Developing accurate predictions of climate change impacts requires estimates of the interactive effects of climate and disturbance regimes at both population and landscape scales. Here we couple a habitat suitability model with a population viability model to examine the interactive effects of climate change and altered fire regimes on a fire-responsive frog species across its geographic range in south-eastern Australia. By 2100, we predict expected minimum abundances (EMA) to decline by 66{\%} (under GFDL-CM2 A1FI climate projections) or 87{\%} (CSIRO Mk3.5 A1FI) in the absence of fire. Increased frequency of low-intensity fires reduced EMA by less than 5{\%}, whereas increased frequency of high-intensity fires reduced EMA by up to 40{\%} compared with the no-fire scenario. While shifts in fire regimes are predicted to impact metapopulation viability, these indirect effects of fire are far less severe than the direct impact of climate change on habitat suitability. Exploring the interactive impacts of climate change and altered disturbance regimes can help managers prioritize threats across space and time. {\textcopyright} 2015.},

The present spatial distribution of H. brasiliensis was evaluated using the Maxent algorithm using bioclimatic variables and species occurrence data from respective regions.

However, the present study addresses the issue related to transferability of niche based model to predict the probable distribution of Hevea species in an unsampled region based on either its native or introduced range of the species. The result indicates that transferability depends on the extent of similarity between the climatic spaces occupied by the species in sampled region and unsampled regions of the species' distribution.

Human plague cases are relatively low incidence but high mortality, which presents unique surveillance and public health challenges, because early detection through surveillance may not always be feasible and infrequent clinical cases may be misdiagnosed.Methods: Based on plague surveillance data and environmental variables, Maxent was applied to model the presence probability of plague host. 75{\%} occurrence points were randomly selected for training model, and the rest 25{\%} points were used for model test and validation. Maxent model performance was measured as test gain and test AUC. The optimal probability cut-off value was chosen by maximizing training sensitivity and specificity simultaneously.Results: We used field surveillance data in an ecological niche modeling (ENM) framework to depict spatial distribution of natural foci of plague in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Most human-inhabited areas at risk of exposure to enzootic plague are distributed in the east and south of the Plateau. Elevation, temperature of land surface and normalized difference vegetation index play a large part in determining the distribution of the enzootic plague.Conclusions: This study provided a more detailed view of spatial pattern of enzootic plague and human-inhabited areas at risk of plague. The maps could help public health authorities decide where to perform plague surveillance and take preventive measures in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. {\textcopyright} 2014 Qian et al.},

abstract = {Little is known about the potentially disrupting effects of wind farms on the habitat connectivity of flying vertebrates at the landscape scale. We developed a regional-scale model to assess the wind farm impact on bat migration and commuting routes. The model was implemented for the bat Nyctalus leisleri in a region of central Italy currently undergoing considerable wind farm development. A Species Distribution Model (SDM) for N. leisleri was generated using the MaxEnt algorithm based on 47 presence records (reduced to 19 after the autocorrelation procedure) and 10 environmental variables derived from topographic and land cover maps. We used the SDM to create a map of connectivity using the software UNICOR to identify potential commuting corridors (PCCs). The incidence of each wind farm on bat flight corridors was assessed by overlaying the existing (380) and planned (195) turbine locations onto the PCCs. The SDM was statistically robust (AUC{\textgreater}0.8).Most of the corridors were concentrated in the western part of the region, which hosts the largest suitable areas for the species; most of the existing (54{\%}) and planned (72{\%}) wind farms interfered with important corridors connecting the western and the eastern parts of the region. Our results provide key information on the impact of the wind farm industry on biodiversity on a regional scale. The novel approach adopted, based on SDM and connectivity analysis, could be easily extended to other flying vertebrates and landscapes and constitutes a promising planning tool necessary for harmonizing the development of renewable energy infrastructures with issues of biodiversity conservation. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.},

abstract = {Survey data over the last 100 years indicate that populations of the endemic Hawaiian leafroller moth, Omiodes continuatalis (Wallengren) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), have declined, and the species is extirpated from large portions of its original range. Declines have been attributed largely to the invasion of non-native parasitoid species into Hawaiian ecosystems. To quantify changes in O. continuatalis distribution, we applied the maximum entropy modeling approach using Maxent. The model referenced historical (1892-1967) and current (2004-2008) survey data, to create predictive habitat suitability maps which illustrate the probability of occurrence of O. continuatalis based on historical data as contrasted with recent survey results. Probability of occurrence is predicted based on the association of biotic (vegetation) and abiotic (proxy of precipitation, proxy of temperature, elevation) environmental factors with 141 recent and historic survey locations, 38 of which O. continuatalis were collected from. Models built from the historical and recent surveys suggest habitat suitable for O. continuatalis has changed significantly over time, decreasing both in quantity and quality. We reference these data to examine the potential effects of non-native parasitoids as a factor in changing habitat suitability and range contraction for O. continuatalis. Synthesis and applications: Our results suggest that the range of O. continuatalis, an endemic Hawaiian species of conservation concern, has shrunk as its environment has degraded. Although few range shifts have been previously demonstrated in insects, such contractions caused by pressure from introduced species may be important factors in insect extinctions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Vorsino et al.},

abstract = {An important decision in presence-only species distribution modeling is how to select background (or pseudo-absence) localities for model parameterization. The selection of such localities may influence model parameterization and thus, can influence the appropriateness and accuracy of the model prediction when extrapolating the species distribution across time and space. We used 12 species from the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT) to evaluate the relationship between the geographic extent from which pseudo-absences are taken and model performance, and shape and importance of predictor variables using the MAXENT modeling method. Model performance is lower when pseudo-absence points are taken from either a restricted or broad region with respect to species occurrence data than from an intermediate region. Furthermore, variable importance (i.e., contribution to the model) changed such that, models became increasingly simplified, dominated by just two variables, as the area from which pseudo-absence points were drawn increased. Our results suggest that it is important to consider the spatial extent from which pseudo-absence data are taken. We suggest species distribution modeling exercises should begin with exploratory analyses evaluating what extent might provide both the most accurate results and biologically meaningful fit between species occurrence and predictor variables. This is especially important when modeling across space or time-a growing application for species distributional modeling. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to cause shifts in species distributions worldwide, threatening their viability due to range reductions and altering their representation in protected areas. Biodiversity hotspots might be particularly vulnerable to climate change because they hold large numbers of species with small ranges which could contract even further as species track their optimal habitat. In this study, we assessed the extent to which climate change could cause distribution shifts in threatened and range-restricted birds in Colombia, a megadiverse region that includes the Tropical Andes and Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena hotspots. To evaluate how climate change might influence species in this region, we developed species distribution models using MAXENT. Species are projected to lose on average between 33 and 43 {\%} of their total range under future climate, and up to 18 species may lose their climatically suitable range completely. Species whose suitable climate is projected to disappear occur in mountainous regions, particularly isolated ranges such as the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Depending on the representation target considered, between 46 and 96 {\%} of the species evaluated may be adequately represented in protected areas. In the future, the fraction of species potentially adequately represented is projected to decline to 30-95 {\%}. Additional protected areas may help to retain representativeness of protected areas, but monitoring of species projected to have the largest potential declines in range size will be necessary to assess the need of implementing active management strategies to counteract the effects of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {An understanding of the habitat selection patterns by wild herbivores is critical for adaptive management, particularly towards ecosystem management and wildlife conservation in semi arid savanna ecosystems. We tested the following predictions: (i) surface water availability, habitat quality and human presence have a strong influence on the spatial distribution of wild herbivores in the dry season, (ii) habitat suitability for large herbivores would be higher compared to medium-sized herbivores in the dry season, and (iii) spatial extent of suitable habitats for wild herbivores will be different between years, i.e., 2006 and 2010, in Matetsi Safari Area, Zimbabwe. MaxEnt modeling was done to determine the habitat suitability of large herbivores and medium-sized herbivores. MaxEnt modeling of habitat suitability for large herbivores using the environmental variables was successful for the selected species in 2006 and 2010, except for elephant (Loxodonta africana) for the year 2010. Overall, large herbivores probability of occurrence was mostly influenced by distance from rivers. Distance from roads influenced much of the variability in the probability of occurrence of medium-sized herbivores. The overall predicted area for large and medium-sized herbivores was not different. Large herbivores may not necessarily utilize larger habitat patches over medium-sized herbivores due to the habitat homogenizing effect of water provisioning. Effect of surface water availability, proximity to riverine ecosystems and roads on habitat suitability of large and medium-sized herbivores in the dry season was highly variable thus could change from one year to another. We recommend adaptive management initiatives aimed at ensuring dynamic water supply in protected areas through temporal closure and or opening of water points to promote heterogeneity of wildlife habitats. {\textcopyright} 2016 Muposhi et al.

abstract = {The methods of Maximum Entropy have been deployed for some years to address the problem of species abundance distributions. In this approach, it is important to identify the correct weighting factors, or priors, to be applied before maximising the entropy function subject to constraints. The forms of such priors depend not only on the exact problem but can also depend on the way it is set up; priors are determined by the underlying dynamics of the complex system under consideration. The problem is one of statistical mechanics and it is the properties of the system that yield the correct MaxEnt priors, appropriate to the way the problem is framed. Here I calculate, in several different ways, the species abundance distribution resulting when individuals in a community are born and die independently. In the usual formulation the prior distribution for the number of species over the number of individuals is 1/. n; the problem can be reformulated in terms of the distribution of individuals over species classes, with a uniform prior. Results are obtained using master equations for the dynamics and separately through the combinatoric methods of elementary statistical mechanics; the MaxEnt priors then emerge a posteriori. The first object is to establish the log series species abundance distribution as the outcome of per capita guild dynamics. The second is to clarify the true nature and origin of priors in the language of MaxEnt. Finally, I consider how it may come about that the distribution is similar to log series in the event that filled niches dominate species abundance. For the general ecologist, there are two messages. First, that species abundance distributions are determined largely by population sorting through fractional processes (resulting in the 1/. n factor) and secondly that useful information is likely to be found only in departures from the log series. For the MaxEnt practitioner, the message is that the prior with respect to which the entropy is to be maximised is determined by the nature of the problem and the way in which it is formulated. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Forty-six percent of tropical raptors are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. Tropical raptors are generally rare species. The scarce information on distribution patterns of rare species makes it difficult to establish reliable conservation plans. We used ecological niche modelling to obtain good predictions of occurrence of two case species, the rare and endemic Gundlach's and Cuban Black-hawks in Cuba, based on presence-only data. We used records from an intensive survey undertaken in natural and modified environments. Data were integrated with environmental variables using Maxent to predict species distributions. Subsequently, we overlaid the resulting predicted distributions, the land use map and the protected areas layers to establish potential suitable habitat for these endemics and to determine if a better design of protected areas than the existing one can be proposed using both hawks' distribution in the design. Gundlach's Hawk distribution was fragmented, depending on forest distribution. Cuban Black-Hawk distribution was narrow, near the coastline. Forests and mangrove represent 57{\%} and 45{\%} of Gundlach's Hawk and Cuban Black-Hawk model predictions, respectively. 71{\%} of the total forest area was represented in the distribution of Gundlach's Hawk. Mangrove area overlaps 45{\%} of the Cuban Black-Hawk distribution. Six protected areas preserved 50{\%} and 92{\%} of their distributions, respectively. With few presence-only data of rare species, Maxent models were statistically and ecologically significant and reliable to develop distribution maps with high predictive power. Our results highlight the importance of natural habitats for conservation efforts of these endemic species. A good conservation program should include the protection of suitable nesting areas and expand the protected areas network containing suitable habitats for both species in forest and coastal areas. We propose the use of predictive modelling tools to strengthen conservation actions not only for rare raptors but for the 238 endemic and threatened birds of the Neotropics with scarce data, small population sizes, restricted distributions and often specialist habits. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.},

Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann) and C. marginalis (Robineau-Desvoidy) had the most widespread geographic and climatic distribution, while the forest-associated C. inclinata (Walker) was the least widespread. Chrysomya putoria (Wiedemann) and C. megacephala (Fabricius) had very similar predicted distributions that were restricted mainly to Limpopo, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and the coast of the Eastern Cape. Chrysomya chloropyga (Wiedemann) and Calliphora croceipalpis (Jaennicke) were the only species predicted to occur at high altitudes. Blowfly distributions restricted to part of the map area were predicted better than those that were more widespread in the region, presumably because species with extremely wide-spread distributions in a study area occupy nearly the whole range of variation of most predictor variables, leaving little variation with which the maximum entropy modelling method can discriminate between presence and absence of the organism.},

Using the Oregon Spotted Frog (Rana pretiosa) as a case study, we developed ecological niche models (ENMs) to guide surveys across the southern extent of the species' geographic distribution and assess the species' presence in California, where some regard it as extirpated. We used MAXENT to generate three ENM variants with 17 verified localities and a unique subset of environmental variables describing land cover, soil, topography, and climate. We applied jack-knife analyses to evaluate the estimates produced by each ENM. All ENMs predicted similar core areas of suitable habitat, but the spatial distribution of each suitability class differed among models. Land cover, particularly emergent herbaceous vegetation, and soils-derived variables most influenced all ENMs. Model evaluations produced moderately high prediction success rates (71{\%}). We generated a consensus model using all ENM variants to facilitate survey site selection, and investigated 44 sites predicted as moderately and highly suitable between 2 April and 17 August 2010. Based on initial on-site evaluations, we repeatedly surveyed 18 of these sites. We detected R. pretiosa at one previously unrecognized locality in Oregon. We show that ENMs generated from small datasets are useful for directing exploratory surveys for rare amphibians, and that variables derived to correspond with a species' ecology can contribute disproportionately to ENMs. {\textcopyright} 2014.

These toads are small, have limited mobility, and a high percentage are endangered or present restricted geographical distributions. We looked at the changes in the size of suitable climatic regions and in the numbers of known occurrence sites within the distribution limits of all species. We used the MaxEnt algorithm to project current and future suitable climatic areas (a consensus of IPCC scenarios A2a and B2a for 2020 and 2080) for each species. 40{\%} of the species may lose over 50{\%} of their potential distribution area by 2080, whereas 28{\%} of species may lose less than 10{\%}. Four species had over 40{\%} of the currently known occurrence sites outside the predicted 2080 areas. The effect of climate change (decrease in climatic suitable areas) did not differ according to the present distribution area, major habitat type or phylogenetic group of the studied species. We used the estimated decrease in specific suitable climatic range to set a conservation priority rank for Melanophryniscus species. Four species were set to high conservation priority: M. montevidensis, (100{\%} of its original suitable range and all known occurrence points potentially lost by 2080), M. sp.2, M. cambaraensis, and M. tumifrons. Three species (M. spectabilis, M. stelzneri, and M. sp.3) were set between high to intermediate priority (more than 60{\%} decrease in area predicted by 2080); nine species were ranked as intermediate priority, while eight species were ranked as low conservation priority. We suggest that monitoring and conservation actions should be focused primarily on those species and populations that are likely to lose the largest area of suitable climate and the largest number of known populations in the short-term. {\textcopyright} 2014 Zank et al.},

Occurrence data of insect pests were collected from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), climatic variables for present climate and future scenarios were sourced, respectively, from WorldClim and from the Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), and distributional data of host tree species were obtained from the European Forest Data Centre (EFDAC), within the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE). The potential habitat of the target pests was calculated using the machine learning algorithm of Maxent model.

A sub-scene of the predicted climate in the year 2100, under the B2a scenario of the Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM3), was extracted and calibrated with topographic variables. A machine learning algorithm based on the maximum entropy theory (Maxent) was employed to generate ecological niche models of 66 forest plant species from 22 families. The results of the study showed that altitude was a significant factor for calibrating all 19 bioclimatic variables. According to the global climate data, the temperature in Peninsular Thailand will increase from 26.6 °C in 2008 to 28.7 °C in 2100, while the annual precipitation will decrease from 2253 mm to 2075 mm during the same period. Currently, nine species have suitable distribution ranges in more than 15{\%} of the region, 20 species have suitable ecological niches in less than 10{\%} while the ecological niches of many Dipterocarpus species cover less than 1{\%} of the region. The number of trees gaining or losing climatically suitable areas is quite similar. However, 10 species have a turnover rate greater than 30{\%} of the current distribution range and the status of several species will in 2100 be listed as threatened. Species hotspots are mainly located in large, intact protected forest complexes. However, several landscape indices indicated that the integrity of species hotspots in 2100 will deteriorate significantly due to the predicted climate change. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

However, these efforts are problematic because they have mostly relied on presence-only data that ignore within-species genetic diversity. Technological advances in high-throughput sequencing have now made it cost-effective to survey the genetic structure of populations sampled throughout the range of a species. These data can be used to delineate two or more genetic clusters within the species range, and to identify admixtures of individuals within genetic clusters that reflect different patterns of ancestry. Species distribution models (SDMs) applied to the presence and absence of genetic clusters should provide more realistic forecasts of geographical range shifts that take account of genetic variability.

abstract = {Species distribution modeling (SDM) is commonly applied to analyze the relationship between species and environment and predicting its distribution. Japanese elaeocarpus (JE), red-stripe rhododendron (RSR) and Chinese guger-tree (CGT) widely distributed in central Taiwan were chosen as target species. JEs are a xeric pioneer and usually grow on uplands with strong sunlight and low soil moisture. RFs have clumpy distribution and form pure stands and can grow on well-drained uplands with sufficient sunlight and acidic soils. CGTs are shade-tolerant and incline to grow in lowlands with wetter soils but need moderate sunlight and have scattered distribution. Hence, the study attempted to develop the SDMs based on terrain-related variables to predict the suitable habitats of these species in the Huisun area in central Taiwan. The base model included elevation, slope, and terrain position and expanded models included the three variables plus topographic wetness index (TWI), and these models were built by maximum entropy (MAXENT), decision tree (DT), and BIOCLIM algorithms. The accuracies of the expanded models with additional TWI were better than that of the base model, regardless of which algorithms being used. The MAXENT and DT models were equally matched in predictive accuracies, and outperformed BIOCLIM. More importantly, the larger the TWI value, the higher likelihood a CGT tree has to grow at a given location, and the opposite is true for either RSR or JE tree. Consequently, this outcome shows that these species have the above-mentioned ecological traits and agrees with our observations from field surveys. The rise in accuracy is relatively limited although this proxy can improve the predictive ability of these SDMs. Therefore, the proxy of solar irradiance (SIR) and high-resolution DEM derived from LiDAR will be incorporated into SDMS so that their predictive ability can be substantially improved.},

abstract = {Anthrax continues to cause significant mortalities in livestock, wildlife and humans worldwide. In Zimbabwe, anthrax outbreaks have been reported almost annually over the past four decades. In this study we tested whether anthrax outbreak data and a set of environmental variables can be used to predict the ecological niche for Bacillus anthracis using maximum entropy modelling for species geographical distribution (Maxent). Confirmed geo-referenced anthrax outbreaks data for the period 1995-2010 were used as presence locations and a set of environmental parameters; precipitation, temperature, vegetation biomass, soil type and terrain as predictor variables. Results showed that the environmental variables can adequately predict the ecological niche of B. anthracis (AUC for test data. = 0.717, p{\textless}. 0.001), with soil type as the most important predictor followed by variance of vegetation biomass and maximum temperature. These results imply that the model we tested may be used by animal health authorities in devising better control strategies for anthrax. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Many alternative processing techniques have recently been proposed in the literature. Most of these techniques rely on specific acquisition protocols as well as on specific data processing techniques, the need for an efficient versatile and expandable NMR processing tool would be a particularly timely addition to the modern NMR spectroscopy laboratory. The work presented here consists in a modeling of the various possible NMR data processing approaches. This modeling presents a common working frame for most of the modern acquisition/processing protocols. Two different data modeling approaches are presented, strong modeling and weak modeling, depending whether the system under study or the measurement is modeled. The emphasis is placed on the weak modeling approach. This modeling is implemented in a computer program developed in python and called NPK standing (standing for NMR Processing Kernel), organized in four logical layers (i) mathematical kernel; (ii) elementary actions; (iii) processing phases; (iv) processing strategies. This organisation, along with default values for most processing parameters allows the use of the program in an unattended manner, producing close to optimal spectra. Examples are shown for 1D and 2D processing, and liquid and solid NMR spectroscopy. NPK is available from the site: http://abcis.cbs.cnrs.fr/NPK. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The importance of parasitism for host populations depends on local parasite richness and prevalence: usually host individuals face higher infection risk in areas where parasites are most diverse, and host dispersal to or from these areas may have fitness consequences. Knowing how parasites are and will be distributed in space and time (in a context of global change) is thus crucial from both an ecological and a biological conservation perspective. Nevertheless, most research articles focus just on elaborating models of parasite distribution instead of parasite diversity. We produced distribution models of the areas where haemosporidian parasites are currently highly diverse (both at community and at within-host levels) and prevalent among Iberian populations of a model passerine host: the blackcap Sylvia atricapilla; and how these areas are expected to vary according to three scenarios of climate change. On the basis of these models, we analysed whether variation among populations in parasite richness or prevalence are expected to remain the same or change in the future, thereby reshuffling the geographic mosaic of host-parasite interactions as we observe it today. Our models predict a rearrangement of areas of high prevalence and richness of parasites in the future, with Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon parasites (today the most diverse genera in blackcaps) losing areas of high diversity and Plasmodium parasites (the most virulent ones) gaining them. Likewise, the prevalence of multiple infections and parasite infracommunity richness would be reduced. Importantly, differences among populations in the prevalence and richness of parasites are expected to decrease in the future, creating a more homogeneous parasitic landscape. This predicts an altered geographic mosaic of host-parasite relationships, which will modify the interaction arena in which parasite virulence evolves. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Species Distribution Models (SDM) are currently common currency as proxies of species distribution range, and using consensus among different algorithms is becoming the latest tendency. This information is frequently used to estimate conservation status or for conservation planning. Nonetheless, different algorithms have huge variation in the outcomes. Usually experts determine whether or not a model is accurate, often followed by a trimming process. However, this accuracy estimation cannot be reproduced. Using Mexican endemic amphibians we evaluate the performance of nine modelling algorithms (Artificial Neural Networks, Classification Tree Analysis, Flexible Discriminant Analysis, Generalised Boosting Model, Generalised Linear Models, Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines, MaxEnt, RandomForest, Surface Range Envelope), their strict geographic consensus, locality records and simple convex-hull areas through comparison of: (1) their presence/absence within Mexico's governmental protected areas, (2) range sizes projected, and (3) differences in estimated richness by all methods. We conducted all good practices prior modelling but removed the trimming factor after modelling to make the process repeatable. Presence-absence threshold was determined through the use of the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC). Presence within conservation network of strict consensus and locality records was similar which indicates an over-fitting of the former, the rest of the algorithms performed similarly, with exception of Surface Range Envelope. Richness patterns varied greatly among algorithms. Distribution borders were the areas with higher sensitivity. MaxEnt obtained the highest performance in omission but consensus performed best in correctly predicting species ranges. Closer interaction between curators and modelers would increase SDMs accuracy, which would improve conservation planning effectiveness. {\textcopyright} 2015.},

abstract = {Anolis sagrei, a Cuba and Bahama native lizard, is a successful invader in Florida and adjacent areas. Herein, we focus on conservatism in its climate niche axes and possible congruencies with its natural history properties. The not mutually exclusive hypotheses of the present study explaining its northern range limit are: (1) climatic conditions within species' native and invasive ranges are identical; (2) the species is pre-adapted to novel conditions as a result of historical climate variations; and (3) only some niche axes limit the species' invasive distribution and the observed pattern is explained by an interplay between the potential niche within its native range and life-history. Species distribution models for native and invasive distributions were built on ten bioclimatic variables. Using Schoener's niche overlap index, the degree of niche conservatism among variables was identified. Significances of hypothesis (1) were tested using null-model approaches. Possible climatic pre-adaptations were evaluated by comparing its actual tolerance within its invasive range with that of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) within its native range (hypothesis 2). Results of (1) and (2) are discussed in relation to natural history, approaching hypothesis 3. We detect varying overlaps in niche axes, indicating that natural history properties are associated with conservative niche axes. Climatic comparisons with LGM of native and current conditions of invasive range suggest that pre-adaptations are unlikely. Possible shifts in the fundamental niche of the species may have been facilitated by enhanced genetic diversity in northern invasive populations. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract = {This study aims at evaluating the performance of the Maximum Entropy method in assessing landslide susceptibility, exploiting topographic and multispectral remote sensing predictors. We selected the catchment of the Giampilieri stream, which is located in the north-eastern sector of Sicily (southern Italy), as test site. On 1 October 2009, a storm rainfall triggered in this area hundreds of debris flow/avalanche phenomena causing extensive economical damage and loss of life. Within this area a presence-only-based statistical method was applied to obtain susceptibility models capable of distinguishing future activation sites of debris flow and debris slide, which where the main source of failure mechanisms for flow or avalanche type propagation. The set of predictors used in this experiment comprised primary and secondary topographic attributes, derived by processing a high resolution digital elevation model, CORINE land cover data and a set of vegetation and mineral indices obtained by processing multispectral ASTER images. All the selected data sources are dated before the disaster. A spatially random partition technique was adopted for validation, generating 50 replicates for each of the two considered movement typologies in order to assess accuracy, precision and reliability of the models. The debris slide and debris flow susceptibility models produced high performances with the first type being the best fit. The evaluation of the probability estimates around the mean value for each mapped pixel shows an inverted relation, with the most robust models corresponding to the debris flows. With respect to the role of each predictor within the modelling phase, debris flows appeared to be primarily controlled by topographic attributes whilst the debris slides were better explained by remotely sensed derived indices, particularly by the occurrence of previous wildfires across the slope. The overall excellent performances of the two models suggest promising perspectives for the application of presence-only methods and remote sensing derived predictors.

abstract = {Ecological niche modeling (and the related species distribution modeling) has been used as a tool with which to assess potential impacts of climate change processes on geographic distributions of species. However, the factors introducing variation into niche modeling outcomes are not well understood: To this end, we used seven algorithms to develop models (Maxent, GARP, BIOCLIM, artificial neural networks, support-vector machines, climate envelope, and environmental distance) to estimate the potential geographic distribution of olives (Olea europaea sensu lato, including Olea ferruginea) under two climatic data sets (current 2000 and future 2050). Five general circulation models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios were used as predictor variables in future projections of the geographic potential of this species; models were fit at global extents (10′ spatial resolution) but transferred and interpreted for a region of particular interest in Central Asia, which largely avoids problems with truncation of niche estimates. We found marked differences among approaches in predicted distributions and model performance, as well as in the future distributional pattern reconstructed, from one algorithm to another. These general approaches, when model-to-model variation is managed appropriately, appear promising in predicting the potential geographic distribution of O. europaea sensu lato and thus can be an effective tool in restoration and conservation planning for wild populations, as well as possible commercial plantations of this species. {\textcopyright} 2017 Ashraf et al.},

We investigated whether climate change will affect the distribution and thus the pattern of hybridization between two pairs of closely related damselfly species [Ischnura damula and I. demorsa, and I. denticollis and I. gemina (this, an endangered species)]. Thus, we estimated the strength of pre and postmating reproductive barriers between both pairs of species, and we predicted future potential distribution under four different Global Circulation Models and a realistic emissions scenario of climate change by using maximum entropy modelling technique. Our results showed that reproductive isolation (RI) is complete in I. damula × I. demorsa individuals: F1 (first generation) hybrids are produced but do not reach sexual maturation. However, RI in I. denticollis × I. gemina hybrids is high but incomplete and unidirectional: only I. gemina females produced F1 hybrids which mate with males and females of I. denticollis and between them producing BC1 (backcrosses) and F2 (second generation) viable hybrids. Maximum entropy models revealed a northern and westward shift and a general reduction of the potential geographic ranges. Based on the pattern of hybridization, for I. damula and I. demorsa there is a current threat as well as a rapid displacement and/or extinction of I. gemina by I. denticollis. However, the current pattern of extinction may not continue due to the contraction in ranges of the four species. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {Cynipids (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) induce a wide variety of complex galls on plants of different botanical families, particularly on Quercus species. Cynipid galls are well known to host large communities of insects, providing fundamental ecological niches for different animal taxa, which are organized in structured and relatively isolated communities at the microhabitat level. Gall communities of Quercus woodlands could be a conservation concern considering some risks, which affect several species of the Parasitica group of Hymenoptera, within which gall wasps and their parasitoids and inquilines are included. These risks concerning Parasitica species are mainly due to three causes: their high trophic level, high host specialization and the lack of knowledge of their biology. In this paper, a preliminary approach to this issue is presented for the Iberian–Balearic range. We model and study the ecological niche of three cynipid gall species that induce galls on Quercus species (Andricus quercustozae, Biorhiza pallida and Plagiotrochus quercusilicis). The cynipid gall species were selected for their different sets of host species and life cycle. The Ecological Niche Factor Analysis and two niche models built for each species (MAXENT and Mahalanobis Distances) support the interpretation that the bioclimatic variables considered have effects on cynipids through their respective sets of host plants. In addition, the results regarding A. quercustozae are consistent with the hypothetical existence of cryptic sexual generation (exposed in other works) parasitizing cork oak (Quercus suber), which could have another key role in its conservation. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {Summary. The Iberian Peninsula is a wintering area for an estimated 300 million birds. Most insectivorous birds winter in the southern half of the Peninsula, where mild mid-winter temperatures ensure the availability of insects. However, case studies of habitat use by specific species during winter are still rare. A species of particular interest is the Eurasian wryneck Jynx torquilla, the only long-distance migratory woodpecker in Europe that feeds almost exclusively on ants. Its European populations have declined throughout Europe over recent decades. Wrynecks are known to winter in the Iberian Peninsula but it has only recently been shown that at least some of these birds originate from Central European breeding populations. Hitherto, the habitats they select in winter have remained unknown although it is plausible to think that they are habitat specific given the birds' strong reliance on ants as their main food source. We studied the wintering habitat selection by wrynecks in northern Extremadura, Spain, with MaxEnt models. We found that they chose diverse, extensive, agricultural (irrigated) croplands. Our findings highlight the importance of these threatened landscapes for wintering birds.},

They interrupt the linear continuity of the river systems as well as the lateral connection of secondary and meadow waters for fish and aquatic invertebrates. Therefore the preservation and restoration of Europe's endangered migratory fish species and habitats are of high priority within the international river basin policy agenda. In order to achieve this objective in the management of water bodies on the one hand a detection and evaluation of the various obstacles, on the other hand a systematic assessment of their cumulative effect is required in the river basins. This paper presents an innovative assessment approach by development of a model that links physical habitat conditions and ecological requirements of species communities and different life stages using a habitat modelling software (MaxEnt) and a dispersal modelling software (FIDIMO) to derive priorities for protected reaches. As a first step we demonstrate that reliable spatial predictions for key fish species can be achieved by modelling habitat suitability with species occurrence data and public available hydromorphological variables. {\textcopyright} 2016 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, London.},

We found a very strong relationship between abundance and suitability for A. caudifer, with suitability predicting 64{\%} of the spatial variation of abundance. When ENM is correlated with spatial variation of abundance, it can be used as a proxy to forecast the impact of changing climate on abundance. We suggest that the positive relationship found for this common species may be applied to rare nectarivore bat species, helping to guide new surveys and to find unknown populations. {\textcopyright} 2012 ABECO.},

abstract = {Statistical modeling of presence-only data has attracted much recent attention in the ecological literature, leading to a proliferation of methods, including the inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP) model, maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling of species distributions and logistic regression models. Several recent articles have shown the close relationships between these methods. We explain why the IPP intensity function is a more natural object of inference in presence-only studies than occurrence probability (which is only defined with reference to quadrat size), and why presence-only data only allows estimation of relative, and not absolute intensity of species occurrence. All three of the above techniques amount to parametric density estimation under the same exponential family model (in the case of the IPP, the fitted density is multiplied by the number of presence records to obtain a fitted intensity). We show that IPP and Maxent give the exact same estimate for this density, but logistic regression in general yields a different estimate in finite samples. When the model is misspecified-as it practically always is- logistic regression and the IPP may have substantially different asymptotic limits with large data sets. We propose "infinitely weighted logistic regression," which is exactly equivalent to the IPP in finite samples. Consequently, many already-implemented methods extending logistic regression can also extend theMaxent and IPP models in directly analogous ways using this technique. {\textcopyright} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2013.},

abstract = {Corythucha ciliata (Hemiptera: Tingidae) is an insect native to North America which has been introduced into Europe, through Italy, in 1964. Since then it has expanded across Europe being its date of arrival and distributional range in Portugal unknown. This important invasive pest feeds on the underside of the leaves of sycamore trees, one of the most widespread ornamental tree in urban areas of Portugal, causing their premature senescence and eventually death, in case of consecutive severe infestations. Habitat modeling is becoming an increasingly important tool for managing biological invasions, either prior or after the introduction of the invasive organism. In this study the software MaxEnt (maximum entropy) was used to model the distribution of Corythucha ciliata in its Portuguese invasive range, from a set of environmental variables and georeferenced occurrence data obtained from observation of Platanus spp. leaves sampled all over the country. According to the best model developed, the areas of greater suitability to invasion of Corythucha ciliata are located in the northern portion of the country whereas the more southern and mountainous areas are of low or virtually null suitability. Laboratory observations of Corythucha ciliata biology allied to records of pest absence across several localities of southern Portugal and predominant occurrence in the northern half of Spain support the model developed. However, model validation requires future prospection in the areas of predicted reduced suitability and where the pest was virtually absent at the moment of sampling. Suitability models can be a useful tool for decision making in management of green spaces. {\textcopyright} 2014, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Predicting species' potential geographical range by species distribution models (SDMs) is central to understand their ecological requirements. However, the effects of using different modeling techniques need further investigation. In order to improve the prediction effect, we need to assess the predictive performance and stability of different SDMs.
Methodology: We collected the distribution data of five common tree species (Pinus massoniana,Betula platyphylla,Quercuswutaishanica, Quercus mongolica and Quercus variabilis ) and simulated their potential distribution area using 13environmental variables and six widely used SDMs: BIOCLIM, DOMAIN, MAHAL, RF, MAXENT, and SVM. Each model run wasrepeated 100 times (trials). We compared the predictive performance by testing the consistency between observations and simulated distributions and assessed the stability by the standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and the 99{\%} confidence interval of Kappa and AUC values.
Results: The mean values of AUC and Kappa from MAHAL, RF, MAXENT, and SVM trials were similar and significantly higherthan those from BIOCLIM and DOMAIN trials (p,0.05), while the associated standard deviations and coefficients of variationwere larger for BIOCLIM and DOMAIN trials (p,0.05), and the 99{\%} confidence intervals for AUC and Kappa values were narrower for MAHAL, RF, MAXENT, and SVM. Compared to BIOCLIM and DOMAIN, other SDMs (MAHAL, RF, MAXENT, and SVM) had higher prediction accuracy, smaller confidence intervals, and were more stable and less affected by the random variable (randomly selected pseudo-absence points).
Conclusions: According to the prediction performance and stability of SDMs, we can divide these six SDMs into two categories: a high performance and stability group including MAHAL, RF, MAXENT, and SVM, and a low performance and stability group consisting of BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN. We highlight that choosing appropriate SDMs to address a specificproblem is an important part of the modeling proces {\textcopyright}:2014 Duan et al.},

Location: South-western Amazonia. Methods: We modelled the distribution of Guadua-dominated forests and geoglyphs with Maxent, which uses occurrence points and a suite of environmental parameters. We compared the modelled distribution of Guadua with mapped distributions derived from remote sensing data, and with the modelled distribution of geoglyphs. Results: The modelled Guadua distribution closely fitted previously mapped estimates. Based on our analyses, the best predictors for the distribution of Guadua-dominated forests are temperature seasonality and close proximity to hilly terrain. Distance to bamboo forest and precipitation of the driest quarter were the most significant predictors of geoglyph distributions. Main conclusions: This study suggests that the most parsimonious explanation for the association of geoglyphs and bamboo forests in south-western Amazonia is that pre-Columbian people constructed geoglyphs near the edges of the semelparous Guadua forests. After die-off events, the large fuel load of dead vegetation would burn easily, providing a much easier mechanism of forest clearing than was possible in closed-canopy forests. These results highlight the interplay of ancient human activity with observed biogeographical patterns, and suggest that pre-Columbian settlement patterns may reflect the heterogeneity of forest types found within Amazonian rain forests. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {The integration of spatial area prioritization algorithms and species distribution modelling has shown great promise in conservation planning in recent years. However, despite the fact that reptiles and amphibians have the highest threat status of all terrestrial vertebrates, these species are often under-represented in conservation planning. The Kingdom of Morocco possesses the richest and most varied herpetofauna in the Maghreb and the western Mediterranean, and is characterized by high species richness, endemism and number of European relict species. Despite the fact that Moroccan reptiles and amphibians have been the subject of numerous studies by a large number of international herpetologists since the beginning of the 20th century, few or none of these concerned their conservation. This study had three main objectives: (1) to identify those areas that harbour the highest species richness; (2) to evaluate the existing and proposed future 'important biological and ecological sites' (SIBES) conservation area network (CAN) with respect to their ability to protect the herpetofauna adequately; and (3) to identify priority areas into which the existing protected areas can be augmented. We used maximum-entropy species distribution modelling to run distribution models for 11 amphibian and 86 reptile species (27.6{\%} endemics and 12.4{\%} threatened) for which we had 2,170 single geographic records. A total of 97 models were used to create a richness map of the Moroccan herpetofauna and thereby detect both areas of high species richness and the distribution patterns of individual species. This map was subsequently used as a basis for performance evaluation of the CAN and area prioritization using the ConsNet conservation planning software initialized by "Rarity" first, while using representation targets of 5{\%} and 10{\%}. Additionally, the proposed future Moroccan CAN (SIBES) was evaluated in terms of its overlay and proximity with ConsNet solutions using visual interpretation and distance measurements in a GIS. Our results show that Moroccan herpetofauna is poorly protected under the existing and future CAN. Prioritization of areas shows that a major increase in conservation area is required to guarantee the persistence of individual herpetofauna species even with a global minimum representation target of only 10{\%}. An increase of the existing CAN is especially needed along parts of the Atlantic coast, in the north-western Mediterranean region, on the north-eastern Moroccan coast, as well as in several areas in the Sahara, notably vast proportions of the Vall{\'{e}}e du Haut and Bas Dr{\^{a}}a. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Aim The extent to which the ranges of temperate biota in East Asia have been shaped by geological and climatic changes during the Pleistocene remains poorly understood. Previous molecular-based studies of the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), which is widespread across China and Japan, suggest that this species was able to persist in multiple refugia in this region. However, limited availability of samples precluded a detailed analysis of past distributions. By integrating ecological niche modelling with phylogenetic analyses, we aim to resolve the impact of past events on the population genetic structure of R. ferrumequinum and provide detailed descriptions of potential distribution patterns during this time. Location Central/East China and Japan. Methods Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using 1098bp of the mitochondrial ND2 gene and 13 microsatellite loci from bats sampled at 26 localities across China and Japan. Haplotype data were used in isolation-with-migration models (IMa) to estimate divergence dates between different lineages, and mismatch distribution analyses were undertaken to test for signs of population expansion. Geographical structuring of the microsatellite data was examined by spatial clustering. Ecological niche modelling was performed based on high-resolution palaeoclimate data inferred for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Results Phylogenetic analyses identified deep levels of divergence between three major lineages broadly corresponding to Central China, East China and Japan. The divergence of all three lineages was estimated to have occurred before the LGM. A strong correlation was observed between the ecological niche model and phylogenetic data, with both methods inferring that R. ferrumequinum populations in Central China did not undergo significant range contractions during glacial episodes. The impact of glacial cycles on East China would have been more severe, with some locations being unable to support viable populations. Zones of secondary contact were identified between Central/East China and East China/Japan, which probably result from some historical gene flow between isolated populations. Main conclusions Integrating ecological niche modelling within phylo-geographical studies provides support for a complex demographic history for R. ferrumequinum in East Asia, as well as persistence during glacial episodes in multiple refugia across their range. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

E. s. strauchi is distinguishable by having green spots on lateral parts of the body, while E. s. kopetdaghica is characterized by white spots and irregular black dots on lateral parts of the body. Recent molecular studies have suggested that these are two distinct species, but other types of analyses leave their classification unclear. In this study, we evaluated their taxonomic status using additional data (including ecological niches) to confirm the hypothesis that they are two species. All known records of their occurrence were employed to predict and evaluate the suitable areas where they may be expected to be found in Iran. We then performed niche similarity tests (niche identity and background tests) and point-based analyses to compare their ecological niches and explain ecological differentiation. Niche models of E. s. strauchi and E. s. kopetdaghica had good results and powerful performance based on high area under the curve (AUC) values [E. s. strauchi = 0.992, standard deviation (SD) = ± 0.008; E. s. kopetdaghica = 0.978, SD = ± 0.032]. Ecological differentiation has been found across the entire range, indicating that ecological differentiation had an important role in species differentiation. Environmental conditions for the species diverged along environmental variables, as precipitation of coldest quarter for the “Strauch” subspecies and precipitation of warmest quarter for the “Kopet dagh” subspecies were most important in determining habitat suitability, respectively. These two factors are important in niche differentiation between the two species and influenced their genetic divergence. Finally, our results confirmed the niche differentiation between E. s. strauchi and E. s. kopetdaghica and added new insights into the taxonomic distinction between E. s. strauchi and E. s. kopetdaghica. {\textcopyright} 2016 Unione Zoologica Italiana.},

abstract = {The geographic distribution of plant species is already being affected by climate change. Cropping patterns of edible plant species and their wild relatives will also be affected, making it important to predict possible changes to their distributions in the future. Currently, species distribution models are valuable tools that allow the estimation of species' potential distributions, in the recent past as well as during other time spans for which climate data have been obtained. With the aim of evaluating how species distributions respond to current and future climate changes, in this work species distribution models were generated for two cultivated species of the Porophyllum genus (Asteraceae), known commonly as ‘p{\'{a}}palos' or ‘p{\'{a}}paloquelites', as well as their Mexican wild relatives, at five points in time (21,000 years ago, present, 2020, 2050, and 2080). Using a database of 1442 entries for 16 species of Porophyllum and 19 environmental variables, species distribution models were constructed for each time period using the Maxent modelling algorithm; those constructed for the future used a severe climate change scenario. The results demonstrate contrasting effects between the two cultivated species; for P. linaria, the future scenario suggests a decrease in distribution area, while for P. macrocephalum distribution is predicted to increase. Similar trends are observed in their wild relatives, where 11 species will tend to decrease in distribution area, while three are predicted to increase. It is concluded that the most important agricultural areas where the cultivated species are grown will not be greatly affected, while the areas inhabited by the wild species will. However, while the results suggest that climate change will affect the distribution of the cultivated species in contrasting ways, evaluations at finer scales are recommended to clarify the impact within cultivation zones. {\textcopyright} 2016, {\textcopyright} The Trustees of the Natural History Museum, London 2016.

abstract = {The distribution of harbour porpoises in EU waters is poorly understood, and modelled predictions of their distributions could inform the strategic spatial planning of future exploitation of the marine environment to avoid potential conflicts. We analysed satellite telemetry data from 39 harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena in inner Danish waters using a modelling tool rooted in maximum entropy: Maxent. Maxent does not require absence data and has been shown to be effective for data characterised by small sample size, sampling bias and locational errors. For each season we used an iterative bootstrapping procedure to randomly select among the most precise records from each of the 39 tagged individuals, and ran Maxent on pooled records based on explanatory environmental variables hypothesised to serve as good proxies for harbour porpoise prey abundance. Among our environmental variables, distance to coast and bottom salinity had the most explanatory power, and their response shapes were relatively consistent across most seasons. The predictive power of the models (assessed by ROC-AUC) ranged from 0.70 to 0.86 within seasons. The southern Kattegat, the Belt Seas, most western part of the Baltic Sea and the Sound were predicted to have relatively high probabilities of occurrence across seasons. In contrast, the central part of Kattegat and the Baltic Sea south and east of Limhamn and Darss Ridge consistently showed low probabilities of occurrence. Areas with the lowest probabilities of occurrence were generally characterised by high predictive uncertainty. Our methods have implications for the analyses of satellite tagged animals in terrestrial and marine environments. By coupling a bootstrapping procedure with Maxent we circumvented some of the statistical challenges presented by satellite telemetry data to generate spatial predictions within the inner Danish waters. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.},

Distributional data were obtained from various published and unpublished sources, and field surveys. Maximum Entropy (Maxent) was used to model the current distribution of Sokoke Scops Owl.

This scenario predicts a southward shift in the future distribution of this species in Kenya and a complete disappearance from the Usambara mountains in Tanzania, with a concomitant 64{\%} reduction in areas of high environmental suitability. Considering the isolated nature of the forest fragments in which this owl survives and the sea of inhospitable human-modified habitat which surrounds these fragments, the future conservation prospects of this species are bleak.

We extended the application of the maximum entropy method (MaxEnt) to model fire occurrence probability in the Brazilian Amazon on a monthly basis during the 2008 and 2010 fire seasons using fire detection data derived from satellite images. Predictor variables included climatic variables, inhabited and uninhabited protected areas and land-use change maps. Model fit was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) value (threshold-independent analysis), binomial tests and model sensitivity and specificity (threshold-dependent analysis). Both threshold-independent (AUC≤0.919±0.004) and threshold-dependent evaluation indicate satisfactory model performance. Pasture, annual deforestation and secondary vegetation are the most effective variables for predicting the distribution of the occurrence data.

abstract = {Species distribution modelling can be a powerful tool in species conservation. Przewalski's gazelle Procapra przewalskii is an endangered ungulate and a conservation focus on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. To identify the potential range and provide a conservation base for the species, we used the maximum entropy approach to build a habitat suitability map and took into account: (1) the comparison among three competing models (the full, uncorrelated and pruned models) with different sets of environmental predictors; and (2) scale effects on model spatial output and performance. Elevation, maximum temperature of the warmest month, mean temperature of the wettest and warmest quarter and isothermality were the five most effective predictors. The 11 threshold-determining approaches identified different thresholds. Spatial patterns of ranges predicted with the three models were similar, although the uncorrelated model was outperformed by the other two models. All three models identified regions in the eastern part of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau as the most suitable habitat for Przewalski's gazelle. Cross-validation area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the full model decreased slightly as the scale increased; spatial congruence AUC fluctuated with the small range, and the predicted range increased disproportionately. This study identifies areas to find new populations and representative habitats of a rare and endangered species. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {The pantropical genus Ixora is highly diverse, with several species endemic to the Philippines. Owing to their endemic nature, many of these species are endangered and little is known about their basic biology. This study aimed to establish baseline information about the bioclimatic niches of Ixora species endemic to the Philippines, determine suitable areas and potential range shifts under future climate conditions, and identify priority areas for conservation and future research. Locality records of 12 endemic Ixora species from the Philippine archipelago were analyzed, with a particular focus on the five most abundant species I. auriculata, I. bartlingii, I. cumingiana, I. macrophylla, and one island endemic species, Ixora palawanensis. Bioclimatic variables from the WorldClim database at 2.5′ resolution were used, with a focus on annual means and seasonality of temperature and precipitation as well as precipitation of the warmest quarter. Analysis of the relationships of the species locations with the bioclimatic variables showed that the bioclimatic niches of the five focal Ixora species generally had narrow temperature and wider precipitation niches. Species distribution modeling with the model Maxent suggested that I. auriculata and I. bartlingii will likely shift their geographic distributions southwards under predicted levels of climate change, while I. cumingiana and I. macrophylla were found to likely expand their ranges. Ixora palawanensis, in contrast, was predicted to decrease its potential distribution with future climate change. Further, results of species distribution modeling for the rare endemic Ixora species I. bibracteata, I. chartacea, I. ebracteolata, I. inaequifolia, I. longistipula, I. luzoniensis, and I. macgregorii were presented, which, however, had much less observation points and therefore only provide a first estimate of potential species distributions. The generated potential habitat suitability maps can assist policy makers in designing conservation strategies for the species and in identifying areas with potential to withstand climate change until at least 2080. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Banana is an important crop in the Kagera region of Tanzania. Banana xanthomonas wilt (BXW) was first reported in Kagera in 2006, and is now an important limiting factor in banana production, because all cultivars are susceptible and infected plants can fail to produce fruit. BXW is caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm), which is spread by farm tools, infected planting materials, and pollinating insects. Practices that address Xcm dissemination, such as mat removal, debudding and tool sterilization, have not prevented the spread of BXW in the region. Disease surveys were conducted in Kagera from 2007 to 2011 to assess BXW presence, monitor its intensity and evaluate its socioeconomic impacts. Spatiotemporal clusters of BXW were analysed with ArcGIS and sas. The relationship between BXW clusters and environmental variables was examined using bivariate correlations in spss; two modelling approaches, MaxEnt (maximum entropy) and logistic regression, were used to predict the potential distribution of BXW in Tanzania. Disease progress over time was best described with the Gompertz model. Significant clustering of BXW was observed in all years and hotspots were located in the Muleba, Karagwe, Misenyi and Bukoba rural districts. These findings suggest that BXW spreads rapidly over short distances. BXW clusters were positively correlated with rainfall and negatively with temperature and altitude. According to MaxEnt, precipitation was the main factor associated with BXW development. MaxEnt and logistic regression predicted a wide potential distribution of BXW in Tanzania because the climate in all banana-growing regions is conducive for its establishment. {\textcopyright} 2016 British Society for Plant Pathology.},

abstract = {1. Evaluating the distribution of species richness where biodiversity is high but has been insufficiently sampled is not an easy task. Species distribution modelling has become a useful approach for predicting their ranges, based on the relationships between species records and environmental variables. Overlapping predictions of individual distributions could be a useful strategy for obtaining estimates of species richness and composition in a region, but these estimates should be evaluated using a proper validation process, which compares the predicted richness values and composition with accurate data from independent sources. 2. In this study, we propose a simple approach to estimate model performance for several distributional predictions generated simultaneously. This approach is particularly suitable when species distribution modelling techniques that require only presence data are used. 3. The individual distributions for the 370 known amphibian species of Mexico were predicted using maxent to model data on their known presence (66 113 presence-only records). Distributions were subsequently overlapped to obtain a prediction of species richness. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the overall species richness values predicted for the region with observed and predicted values from 118 well-surveyed sites, each with an area of c. 100 km2, which were identified using species accumulation curves and nonparametric estimators. 4. The derived models revealed a remarkable heterogeneity of species richness across the country, provided information about species composition per site and allowed us to obtain a measure of the spatial distribution of prediction errors. Examining the magnitude and location of model inaccuracies, as well as separately assessing errors of both commission and omission, highlights the inaccuracy of the predictions of species distribution models and the need to provide measures of uncertainty along with the model results. 5. The combination of a species distribution modelling method like maxent and species richness estimators offers a useful tool for identifying when the overall pattern provided by all model predictions might be representing the geographical patterns of species richness and composition, regardless of the particular quality or accuracy of the predictions for each individual species. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

To reveal their current potential habitats, the effects of climate change and their future distribution in various areas of Iran we used maximum entropy modeling (Maxent). To produce the models, samples were collected from 218 areas of Iran resulting in discovering 271 points where the nabids were found. The accuracy and performance of distribution models were also evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve and jack-knife analysis. In the Maxent model, the climatic, elevation and land cover layers were the major bases for the current models. In modeling future distribution, the land cover layer was excluded. The distribution of N.pseudoferus was independent of the type of vegetation while the distribution of N.palifer varied according to differences in type of vegetation. Using jack-knife analysis, the land cover and precipitation were the most effective predictors driving the two Nabis species range expansion. From 2013 to 2050 the impacts of climate change on N.pseudoferus distribution was predicted to have a negative impact but have a positive effect on N.palifer range expansion.

Instead of using feature-based methods as conventional models, our method attempts to date documents in a year level by exploiting relative temporal relations between documents and events, which are very effective for dating documents. Based on this intuition, we proposed an event-based time label propagation model called confidence boosting in which time label information can be propagated between documents and events on a bipartite graph. The experiments show that our event-based propagation model can predict document timestamps in high accuracy and the model combined with a MaxEnt classifier outperforms the state-of-the-art method for this task especially when the size of the training set is small. {\textcopyright} 2013 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

abstract = {Species distribution modelling (SDM) is a powerful tool to investigate various biological questions with a spatial component, but is also sensitive to presence-data characteristics, particularly data precision and clustering. Here, we investigate the effect of these two factors on SDM using Maxent as the modelling technique and wall lizards (genus Podarcis Wagler, 1830) from North Africa as a model system. Podarcis are not ubiquitous in Africa as they are in Europe, but their ecological and distributional characteristics in this area are poorly known. Our results show that the most important environmental factors related to the distribution of this genus in North Africa are humidity, habitat type, and temperature. The areas of potential distribution predicted by models based on data sets with different precision and clustering characteristics show high relatedness to coastal areas and mountain ranges and extend to areas were presence records for these lizards are lacking. Our comparison of models based on different data sets indicates that finer scale models, even if based on fewer presence locations, outperform coarser scale ones. Data clustering does not have a negative effect on model performance, but is rather overcome by sample-size effects. Similar approaches may be of general application to other stenoic species for which available locations are scarce in comparison with the extension of the study area. {\textcopyright} 2008 NRC.},

The data were obtained from the entomology services of the state departments of health in Central-West Brazil, scientific collections and a literature review of articles from 1962- 2014. Ecological niche models were produced for sandfly species with more than 20 occurrences using the Maxent algorithm and eight climate variables. In all, 2,803 phlebotomine records for 127 species were analysed. Nyssomyia whitmani, Evandromyia lenti and Lutzomyia longipalpis were the species with the greatest number of records and were present in all the biomes in Central-West Brazil. The models, which were produced for 34 species, indicated that the Cerrado areas in the central and western regions of Central-West Brazil were climatically more suitable to sandflies. The variables with the greatest influence on the models were the temperature in the coldest months and the temperature seasonality. The results show that phlebotomine species in Central-West Brazil have different geographical distribution patterns and that climate conditions in essentially the entire region favour the occurrence of at least one Leishmania vector species, highlighting the need to maintain or intensify vector control and surveillance strategies. {\textcopyright} 2015 Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

Multivariate analysis of the pooled data has grouped the 64 genotypes into nine distinct clusters with high genetic variance between the clusters (D2) and low variance within the clusters (D). Cluster II was the largest, consisting of 17 genotypes and cluster VI and VII were with only one genotype each. The intra cluster D values ranged from 0 (cluster VI and VII) to 7.68 (cluster IX). However the inter cluster D2values varied from 2.82 to 22.32, the lowest value recorded between cluster I and II and the highest between clusters VI and IX. It was observed that the single genotype in cluster number VI with low performance for majority of the characters studied was the farthest to most of the diverse clusters. Crosses between genotypes of cluster VI with that of cluster III (for high 100 seed weight), cluster IV (for maximum number of pods per plant, pods per cluster, cluster per plant and seed yield per plant) and cluster IX (for better plant height, peduncle length, pod length and seeds per pod) may prove advantageous in realizing new recombinants with desired traits.

To assess the suitability of this environment for pine marten re-establishment, presence only distribution data combined with landcover data at a 10-km scale were used in a species distribution modelling study using Maxent. The results indicated that approximately 32{\%} (4500 km2) of the land area of Northern Ireland had a high probability of pine marten occurrence. Pine marten distribution was positively associated with the extent of conifer forest landcover types, which also had the highest single attribute contribution to the model.

abstract = {Global warming enables the immigration of species previously absent from a given region. Coraebus florentinus (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is a beetle with a Mediterranean distribution that has expanded its northern range margin northwards within the last 30 years. It develops in branches and shoots of oak (Quercus spp.) and is considered a pest in Mediterranean countries. By modelling the current spatial distribution of C. florentinus using three independent modelling approaches (generalised linear models, boosted regression trees, maximum entropy modelling) we identified abiotic factors which explain its current spatial distribution (1991-1999) in south-west Germany and reconstructed its immigration into Germany since 1950. All modelling approaches suggest that monthly maximum temperatures determined the range margin of the species in south-west Germany from 1991 to 1999. Occurrence probabilities increased exponentially with mean maximum temperatures higher than 10 °C in March and 22 °C in June. Mean precipitation in May also seems to be important for the species occurrence, particularly in regions where oaks grow on poor sandy soil; however, this generally plays a minor role. All of these environmental conditions are linked to higher reproduction of C. florentinus on oaks in warm and dry habitats, as reported from southern Europe. We show that climatic conditions for the beetle have improved significantly in south-west Germany since 1950, which is most likely the reason for the northward shift of its range margin. Our modelling results suggest a further range expansion of the beetle in Central Europe. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

An increase in the number of water bodies invaded by hygrophila since 1990 suggests that current methods employed to control this weed are inadequate. Classical biological control may be a viable option for long term regulation of hygrophila in the invaded range. In this study, we used the Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Model (MaxEnt) to prioritize climatically suitable native habitats in India and Bangladesh for conducting exploratory surveys to collect biological control agents. In total, 164 point occurrences from the United States and Mexico and 20 predictor variables, including 19 bioclimatic variables and altitude, were used to predict the native distribution of hygrophila. Performance of the model was statistically verified using threshold dependent binomial tests and area under the curve (AUC) score of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve plot. The results showed that the model performed significantly better than random in both binomial tests and AUC analyses. High suitability of occurrence of hygrophila was predicted in the northeastern region of India and northern and eastern parts of Bangladesh. Based on percent omission of known native occurrences, a color-coded final distribution map was prepared to prioritize areas for conducting future surveys. Our study proposes a technique that can be useful for prioritizing areas in native ranges for exploratory surveys to collect biological control agents. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Recently, naturalized populations of this species have spread rapidly, particularly in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Two niche-based models were constructed from independent data sets (presence-absence and presence-only data sets) and were used to validate one another. Both models performed well and indicated that the data compiled by participatory programs were useful for generating predictive models of the potential distribution of this invasive species. The models also revealed that the potential distribution of B. terrestris is negatively related to the proportion of woodland area, which corresponds to the known biology of this species. In contrast, the effect of the number of colonies introduced for tomato pollination (represented by tomato production) did not significantly affect the distribution of B. terrestris, indicating that its spread is now entering a phase of dispersal from established feral populations and that primary dispersal from commercial colonies in greenhouses is no longer a limiting factor for the distribution of this invasive species. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Borneo has experienced a rapid decline in the extent of forest cover, which has reduced the amount of habitat available for many plant and animal species. The precise impact of habitat loss on the conservation status of dipterocarp trees is uncertain. We use three contrasting techniques, the extent of occurrence, area of occupancy and ecological niche models derived using maxent, in conjunction with a current land-use map of Sabah, to derive estimates of habitat loss and infer a regional IUCN Red List conservation status for 33 Sabah dipterocarp species. Estimates of habitat loss differed significantly according to the methods employed and between species on different habitat types. Proportion of habitat loss determined from the ecological niche models varied from 21 percent for Shorea micans to 99.5 percent for Dipterocarpus lamellatus. Thirty-two of the 33 dipterocarp species analyzed in this study would have their Sabah populations classified as Threatened (equal to a habitat loss of {\textgreater} 30{\%}) under the A2 IUCN Red List criterion. Dipterocarps that occur in lowland forests have experienced greater habitat loss than upland/lower montane or ultramafic species. In addition, species with the lowest predicted area within their historic distributions had the highest proportion of habitat lost, which provides a rationale for targeting conservation effort on the species with narrow distributions. We recommend the ecological niche modeling approach as a rapid assessment tool for reconstructing species' historic distributions during conservation assessments of tropical trees. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s) Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2012 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are a tool for predicting the eventual geographical range of an emerging pathogen. Most SDMs, however, rely on an assumption of equilibrium with the environment, which an emerging pathogen, by definition, has not reached. To determine if some SDM approaches work better than others for modelling the spread of emerging, non-equilibrium pathogens, we studied time-sensitive predictive performance of SDMs for Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a devastating infectious fungus of amphibians, using multiple methods trained on time-incremented subsets of the available data. We split our data into timeline-based training and testing sets, and evaluated models on each set using standard performance criteria, including AUC, kappa, false negative rate and the Boyce index. Of eight models examined, we found that boosted regression trees and random forests performed best, closely followed by MaxEnt. As expected, predictive performance generally improved with the length of time series used for model training. These results provide information on how quickly the potential extent of an emerging disease may be determined, and identify which modelling frameworks are likely to provide useful information during the early phases of pathogen expansion. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.},

abstract = {Major landscape transformations have occurred in the northern Mediterranean over the last decades, including urbanization, agricultural intensification and land abandonment, which, in turn, increase the risk of the propagation of fire. We used repeated-count surveys conducted at 369 sites in France and Spain to jointly model the effects of environmental covariates on the abundance, occupancy and detection of Hermann's tortoise, a long-lived and endangered species, using a novel zero-inflated approach. We also employed a large dataset of presence-only data collected in Provence to model environmental influences on occurrence probability using maximum entropy models. In both France and Spain, sites that experienced wildfires over the last 50. years hosted 31{\%} fewer individuals than unburned sites. In Provence, higher wildfire frequency decreased this species' occurrence probability, from 50{\%} when 0-1 fire had occurred over the last 50. years, to 7{\%} in areas that had burned at least 3 times. We also showed that abundance required a long recovery time (more than 25. years) after wildfires. In Provence, the highest occurrence probability for this species was found in patchy landscapes and scrub and/or herbaceous vegetation. The lowest species occurrence was found in extensive artificial areas, vineyards and arable lands. These results suggest a high risk of population extinction in the future if these types of habitats continue to expand in plains and coastal areas to the detriment of scrublands. Higher wildfire frequency predicted by climate change scenarios in the Mediterranean is also likely to increase the risk of extinction for some populations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim: Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) often involve some degree of projection into novel covariate space (i.e. extrapolation), because calibration data may not encompass the entire space of interest. Most methods for identifying extrapolation focus on the range of each model covariate individually. However, extrapolation can occur that is well within the range of univariate variation, but which exhibits novel combinations between covariates. Our objective was to develop a tool that can detect, distinguish and quantify these two types of novelties: novel univariate range and novel combinations of covariates. Location: Global, Australia, South Africa. Methods: We developed a new multivariate statistical tool, based on the Mahalanobis distance, which measures the similarity between the reference and projection domains by accounting for both the deviation from the mean and the correlation between variables. The method also provides an assessment tool for the detection of the most influential covariates leading to dissimilarity. As an example application, we modelled an Australian shrub (Acacia cyclops) widely introduced to other countries and compared reference data, global distribution data and both types of model extrapolation against the projection globally and in South Africa. Results: The new tool successfully detected and quantified the degree of dissimilarity for points that were either outside the univariate range or formed novel covariate combinations (correlations) but were still within the univariate range of covariates. For A. cyclops, more than half of the points (6617 of 10,785) from the global projection space that were found to lie within the univariate range of reference data exhibited distorted correlations. Not all the climate covariates used for modelling contributed to novelty equally over the geographical space of the model projection. Main conclusions: Identifying non-analogous environments is a critical component of model interrogation. Our extrapolation detection (ExDet) tool can be used as a quantitative method for exploring novelty and interpreting the projections from correlative SDMs and is available for free download as stand-alone software from http://www.climond.org/exdet. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley and Sons Ltd.},

Freshwater turtles are among the most traded pets; an increasing number of species are easily available and frequently released by owners in natural wetlands. This study identified a pool of freshwater turtles frequently traded at cheap prices, and performed risk assessment at multiple steps of the invasion process. Establishment risk was assessed through species distribution models (MaxEnt and Boosted Regression Trees) based on global presence records and bioclimatic variables. We also analyzed ecological and life history traits favouring release, establishment and population growth. Besides the already invasive Trachemys scripta, at least 14 species are easily found in the pet market. For most of them, species distribution models identified areas with suitable climate outside the native range. Validation with independent data confirmed the reliability of the modelling approach. Pelodiscus sinensis and Pelomedusa subrufa had the broadest areas of suitable climate outside the native range. For all the species, possibility of coexistence with humans and reproductive traits suggest high risk of invasion, if introduced in areas with suitable climate. The availability of spatially explicit maps of risk allows to identify areas where preventive measures are urgently needed. In Europe, an expansion of trade regulations is needed to avoid that multiple freshwater turtles become invasive. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) habitat in the Texas Panhandle, USA has been lost through growth of human settlements and agricultural lands. We determined the most pertinent environmental variables affecting habitat selection using multiple methods, including a search of peer-reviewed literature, expert opinion ranking, and habitat suitability modeling. We determined quality and extent of pronghorn habitat in the Texas Panhandle using the MAXENT modeling environment to build a presence-only habitat suitability model based on global positioning system (GPS) locations collected via aerial surveys. Our habitat suitability model indicated that woodlands, agricultural land, and summer precipitation had the greatest contributions to the overall model. Areas with greatest habitat suitability are associated with high pronghorn population densities, particularly in the northwestern corner of the Panhandle. This probabilistic model may serve as a useful tool for pronghorn conservation primarily because it provides insight into what factors are most predictive of their presence, which areas are most suitable for pronghorn, and as a simple, replicable process to identify and evaluate pronghorn habitat. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Wildlife Society. {\textcopyright} The Wildlife Society, 2016},

abstract = {Migratory raptors rarely fly over stretches of water larger than 25 km, although different species undertake water crossings of varying lengths, depending mainly on their wing morphology. Oriental Honey-buzzards fly c. 680 km over the East China Sea in autumn from breeding areas in Japan to wintering areas in Southeast Asia, but avoid this long water crossing in spring. We investigated the effects of weather on this exceptional migratory behaviour and its seasonality through a maximum entropy niche modelling approach. We used data collected through satellite tracking of 31 adult birds as presence points and a set of variables related to wind, precipitation and convective condition as environmental predictors. Results of modelling showed very different, almost non-overlapping, areas suitable for migration over the East China Sea region in autumn and spring. Suitable migration routes in autumn mostly occurred over the sea, whereas suitable areas for spring migration mostly occurred over land, suggesting that circumnavigating the East China Sea is preferable in spring. At the regional scale, wind conditions facilitate water-crossing behaviour of Oriental Honey-buzzards in autumn, but not in spring. Specifically, suitable tailwinds over the sea enable water-crossing in autumn, whereas in spring, wind support and convective conditions are best over land. Our modelling did not suggest any importance of convective conditions for autumn migration. However, we expect that at smaller temporal scales, convective conditions would be a considerable facilitator of the water-crossing behaviour in this species. {\textcopyright} 2016 British Ornithologists' Union},

We investigated nest site selection and the effects of land use on its distribution in a multi-scale approach using nest positions obtained during three consecutive breeding seasons. We identified two environmental predictors, namely Tasseled cap 1 (a range value of land brightness) and slope, and three variables derived from human use (house densities, unpaved roads and fences) as the best predictors of occurrence of the species. Only slope had a positive and significant effect on stonechat occurrence; the rest being negative. Results were not restricted by the scale, indicating that design of special protection areas should be developed considering the landscape scale. Our results provide a robust prediction of the species distribution throughout Fuerteventura, demonstrating that our approach can also cope for the low vegetation signal within small arid regions such as islands. Future land use planning and management for the island should avoid the presence of negative impact elements such as opening new roads and new urbanisations in nearby habitats with the highest probabilities of species occurrence. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Pressure to conserve biodiversity with limited resources has led to increasing use of species distribution models (SDMs) for spatial conservation prioritization. Published spatial prioritization exercises often focus on well-studied groups, with data compiled from on-line databases of ad-hoc collections. Conservation plans generally aim to protect all components of biodiversity, and it is implied that the species used in prioritization act as surrogates. Here, we assess the sensitivity of spatial priorities to model and surrogate choice using a case study from a fragmented agricultural area of south eastern Australia that is poorly represented in the national reserve system. We model the distributions of 30 species of bird, microbat and bee using two types of SDM; generalised linear models based on systematic surveys that yield presence and absence observations, and MaxEnt models based on biodiversity database records. Eight prioritization scenarios were tested using Zonation software, and were based on either the presence-background or presence-absence SDMs and combinations of surrogacy among the three taxa. We found low correlations between SDMs generated for the same species using different modelling frameworks ($\mu$ = 0.18, n = 26). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) estimates generated by MaxEnt were optimistic; on average 1.36 times higher than when tested against the systematic survey data. Conservation priorities were sensitive to the choice of surrogate and type of data used to fit SDMs, and though bats and birds formed moderately good surrogates for each other, there was less compelling evidence of surrogacy for bees. Because valid surrogacy is unlikely with most existing data sets, investment in high quality data for less-surveyed groups prior to planning should still be a priority. If this is not possible, then it is advisable to analyse the sensitivity of conservation plans to the assumed surrogacy and quality of data available.

abstract = {The Subg. Salvia Benth. is the largest subgenus in the Salvia Linn. and is native to China. Most of the 44 species and 13 varieties in the subgenus contain active compounds and have medicinal effects similar to that of Salvia miltiorrhiza, and thus serves as a wild resource with relatively high prospects as medicinal plants. Morphological investigation shows that Subg. Salvia exhibits the original characteristics of the Salvia as well as notable species differentiation, and so it is an important group for studying the origin and evolution of the Salvia. Geographically, this subgenus is mainly distributed in higher elevation areas in the Tibetan Plateau and Hengduan Mountains, nevertheless a few extending to central and east China. Hence, intense pressure exists to protect this resource due to the subgenus is vulnerable to environmental, global climate change and disturbance of human activities. Based on aforementioned factors and combined with specimen records, documented 2689 species distribution records with latitude and longitude information, and 1007 records with elevation information, covering 286 county-level regions, a comprehensive survey of Subg. Salvia was conducted and their distribution map was plotted. Furthermore, their distribution pattern was analyzed on the level and vertical dimensions at the different sections and series in the subgenus. The potential distribution regions with Subg. Salvia were predicted using maximum entropy ecological niche modelling (Maxent). In addition, dominant climatic factors affecting its present distribution were confirmed. The results showed that the Hengduan Mountains serves as the diversity center of this subgenus; its distribution range is from southeastern Tibet to western Sichuan, rarely spreading to northern Hebei and eastern Hubei. In this subgenus, narrow-ranging endemic species have a very high proportion (45{\%} of all species). In addition, the six series within the subgenus show a vicarious distribution as related to elevation, gradual transitioning from the narrow-ranging species of high elevation to wide-ranging species of low elevation. The subgenus potential distribution obtained based on a maximum entropy model was mostly consistent with the actual distribution of the species. Regarding the relationship between single climatic factors and probability of occurrence, the amount of precipitation of September and December, the temperature annual range, altitude, maximum temperature of March and temperature seasonality are the dominant climate factors influencing species distribution. In view of a key innovation for Salvia speciation, stamen differentiation was investigated in this study. The results showed that the filament to connective ratios of the stamen of Subsect. Annuae, Ser. Campanulatae and Ser. Maximowiczianae, of which the distributions spread to low-elevation areas, are far smaller than Ser. Hiantes, Ser. Digitaloidites and Ser. Brachylomae, of which the distributions are concentrated in high-elevation areas in the southwest; thus the former may be more evolutionary advanced than the latter. Environmental and climatic factors and pollinator choice may together determine the current distribution pattern of the Subg. Salvia. {\textcopyright} 2015, Ecological Society of China.

abstract = {Understanding the factors that determine the distribution of taxa at various spatial scales is a crucial challenge in the context of global climate change. This holds particularly true for polar marine biota that are composed of both highly adapted and vulnerable faunas. We analysed the distribution of 2 Antarctic echinoid species, Sterechinus antarcticus and S. neumayeri, at the scale of the entire Southern Ocean using 2 niche modelling procedures. The performance of distribution models was tested with regard to the known ecology of the species. The respective contributions of environmental parameters are discussed along with the putative roles played by biotic interactions and biogeographic processes. Depth was the parameter that contributed most to both distribution models, whereas sea ice coverage and sea surface temperature had significant contributions for S. neumayeri only. Suitability maps of the 2 species were mostly similar, with a few notable differences. The Campbell Plateau and Tasmania were predicted as suitable areas for S. antarcticus only, while S. neumayeri was restricted to the south of the Ant arctic Polar Front. However, numerous sampling data attest that S. antarcticus is absent from the Campbell Plateau and from Tasmania. Different hypotheses are formulated to explain the mismatch between observed and modelled distribution data. They stress the putative roles played by both oceanographic barriers to dispersal (Antarctic Polar Front), biotic factors (species exclusion patterns) and biogeographic processes (ongoing dispersal). {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2012 {\textperiodcentered} www.int-res.com.},

abstract = {We applied the ecological niche/habitat modelling approach to predict the potential winter distribution of the endangered Black-capped Vireo Vireo atricapilla. We used historical and current field records along with climatic and topographic variables to generate three different models (Biomapper, Maxent, and GARP). Using field data on species occurrence, a model was selected based on the accuracy of assessment results. A final model was obtained by eliminating those areas mapped as known unsuitable habitat, using high resolution land use/land cover data. The GARP model obtained the best accuracy values. It showed the winter distribution of the Black-capped Vireo to cover an area in western Mexico of about 141,000 km2 that runs along the Pacific coast from southern Sonora (Ro Yaqui, Alvaro Obregn Dam) to the southern state of Oaxaca (Salina Cruz on the Pacific coast and Matias Romero, and inland). One third of the proposed models area was located at elevations of 0-500 m, while 83{\%} occurred at elevations {\textless} 1,250 m; however, a significant area (17{\%}) consists of sites {\textgreater} 1,250 m in elevation. For the most part, the distribution model proposed closely followed the tropical dry forest boundaries and clearly avoided temperate areas at higher elevations. This situation seems to be critical for the species, since the dry forest is one of most endangered Neotropical ecosystems, both nationally and internationally. Furthermore, the array of areas under protection regimes included only about 7.1{\%} of the predicted wintering area. However, this figure could be misleading when it is considered that some protected areas are just "paper reserves" without significant conservation programmes developed in situ. {\textcopyright} 2010 BirdLife International.},

abstract = {Introductions of non-indigenous species (NIS) are considered a major threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide. While it is valuable to know the distributions and ranges of NIS, predictive spatial models along different environmental gradients are more useful for management of these species. In this study we modelled how external drivers and local environmental conditions contribute to the spatial distribution of an invasive species using the distribution of the round goby Neogobius melanostomus in the Baltic Sea as an example. Using the collected distribution data, an updated map on the species distribution and its invasion progress in the Baltic Sea was produced. The current range of the round goby observations is extensive, covering all major sub-basins of the Baltic Sea. The most recent observations appeared in the northern regions (Northern Baltic Proper, the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland) and on the eastern and western coasts of southern Sweden. Modelling results show that the distribution of the round goby is primarily related to local abiotic hydrological conditions (wave exposure). Furthermore, the probability of round goby occurrence was very high in areas in close proximity to large cargo ports. This links patterns of the round goby distribution in the Baltic Sea to shipping traffic and suggests that human factors together with natural environmental conditions are responsible for the spread of NIS at a regional sea scale. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study the present and future predicted distribution of the Atlantic-European soft-water pools specialist Hypericum elodes L. (Hypericaceae) is modelled in order to facilitate appropriate decision making for conservation, monitoring and future research. Using the methods of Maximum Entropy the future distribution has been examined with the HadCM3 climate model over the year 2050. H. elodes is confirmed as a climate-sensitive species, with a W-European distribution and preferences for acid substrates. The model shows a marked negative influence of climate change on H. elodes. In a locality analysis the outcome is a c. 58{\%} reduction in the number of pre-existing bioclimatically suitable localities by 2050. In an area analysis the outcome is a 57{\%} reduction in suitable bioclimatic space by 2050. This study establishes a fundamental baseline for assessing the consequences of climate change on populations of H. elodes. Specifically, it: (1) identifies and categorizes localities and areas that are predicted to be under threat from climate change now and in the medium term (2050), representing assessment priorities for ex situ conservation; (2) identifies 'core localities' that could have the potential to withstand climate change until at least 2050, and therefore serve as long-term in situ stocks for H. elodes genetic resources.},

We applied a maximum entropy algorithm modeling program (MAXENT) to field data Boubli collected from 1991 to 2007. We used 23 environmental coverage variables to model the distribution of the primates. The layers were related to precipitation, temperature, topography, and ecological bioregions or Ecoregions. The predicted distribution for Cacajao hosomi was strongly associated with the Negro-Branco Moist Forest and Guianan Highlands Moist Forests Ecoregions, and the Worldclim variables Bio3 (isothermality), Bio4 (temperature seasonality) and Bio17 (precipitation of the driest quarter). Cacajao melanocephalus was strongly associated with Japur{\'{a}}/ Solim{\~{o}}es-Negro Moist Forests, Caquet{\'{a}} Moist Forests, Pur{\'{u}}s V{\'{a}}rzea Flooded Forests, Rio Negro Campinaranas, and Cordillera Oriental Montane Forests, Ecoregions. Cacajao ayresi was strongly associated with Negro-Branco Moist Forest and Rio Negro Campinarana Ecoregions as well as Worldclim Bio3 (isothermality). Chiropotes israelita was also strongly associated with Worldclim Bio3 (isothermality) followed by the Negro Branco Moist Forests and Guianan Piedmont and Lowland Moist Forests Ecoregion, and to the Guianan Highland moist forests. These results show a great overlap between the bearded saki and 2 black uakaris, Cacajao hosomi and C. ayresi. Given that one cannot attribute the separation between the species in the Rio Negro-Rio Branco interfluvium to the existence of geographical barriers such as rivers, we suggest that the present geographical boundaries and thus coexistence of the 3 pithecines north of the Rio Negro is maintained by competitive exclusion or stochastic events. Until more surveys are conducted, the present geographical distributions of the pithecines and the mechanism maintaining their boundaries in the Rio Negro-Rio Branco interfluvium will remain uncertain. One important contribution of our model is to identify areas of higher probability of occurrence that might be helpful in guiding future survey expeditions and choices of areas for future conservation of pithecines. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Fire regimes are strongly related to weather conditions that directly and indirectly influence fire ignition and propagation. Identifying the most important meteorological fire drivers is thus fundamental for daily fire risk forecasting. In this context, several fire weather indices have been developed focussing mainly on fire-related local weather conditions and fuel characteristics. The specificity of the conditions for which fire danger indices are developed makes its direct transfer and applicability problematic in different areas or with other fuel types. In this paper we used the low-to-intermediate fire-prone region of Canton Ticino as a case study to develop a new daily fire danger index by implementing a niche modelling approach (Maxent). In order to identify the most suitable weather conditions for fires, different combinations of input variables were tested (meteorological variables, existing fire danger indices or a combination of both). Our findings demonstrate that such combinations of input variables increase the predictive power of the resulting index and surprisingly even using meteorological variables only allows similar or better performances than using the complex Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI). Furthermore, the niche modelling approach based on Maxent resulted in slightly improved model performance and in a reduced number of selected variables with respect to the classical logistic approach. Factors influencing final model robustness were the number of fire events considered and the specificity of the meteorological conditions leading to fire ignition. {\textcopyright} 2015 De Angelis et al.},

The present study assessed the influence of different ecogeographic variables determining the distribution of leopards in and around Sariska Tiger Reserve through MaxEnt habitat suitability model based on camera trapping method. Camera trapping was used to collect presence/absence information in the study area from December 2008 to June 2010. Information of 11 macrohabitat characteristics and variables (habitat types, prey species, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), elevation, livestock, village, water source, etc.) were collected along with leopard presence data. The probability of presence of leopards increased with decreasing distance to water and increasing encounter rate of peafowl (Pavo cristatus), chital (Axis axis), sambar (Rusa unicolor), and wild pig (Sus scrofa). It was found that the probability of presence of leopards increased with increasing area of Zizyphus mixed forest patches and NDVI. Results of this study showed that the probability of presence of leopards was higher in habitat types with intermediate cover, high wild prey base, and water sources. They also indicated that leopards are not always 'generalists' showing some degree of specialization, at least in their choice of habitat, and this information is useful for conserving leopard in human-dominated landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Bia{\l}owie{\.{z}}a, Poland.},

Incorporation of conservation planning into development planning may mitigate these impacts. The threatened Lesser Prairie- Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) is experiencing loss of native habitat and high levels of energy development across its multijurisdictional range. Our goal was to explore relationships of the species occurrence with landscape characteristics and anthropogenic effects influencing its distribution through evaluation of habitat suitability associated with one particular habitat usage, lekking. Lekking has been relatively well-surveyed, though not consistently, in all jurisdictions. All five states in which Lesser Prairie-Chickens occur cooperated in development of a Maxent habitat suitability model. We created two models, one with state as a factor and one without state. When state was included it was the most important predictor, followed by percent of land cover consisting of known or suspected used vegetation classes within a 5000 m area around a lek. Without state, land cover was the most important predictor of relative habitat suitability for leks. Among the anthropogenic predictors, landscape condition, a measure of human impact integrated across several factors, was most important, ranking third in importance without state. These results quantify the relative suitability of the landscape within the current occupied range of Lesser Prairie-Chickens. These models, combined with other landscape information, form the basis of a habitat assessment tool that can be used to guide siting of development projects and targeting of areas for conservation. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the author(s).},

Opportunistic "citizen science" observations submitted by hikers in remote alpine regions can be valuable, as coverage can be extensive compared to scientific field surveys. Here, we compare the performance of two regression and three machine learning statistical modeling approaches and an ensemble model to predict the distribution of the Vancouver Island subspecies of White-tailed Ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura saxatilis) based on two datasets: (1) field survey observations from radio-telemetry and call-playbacks, and (2) opportunistic citizen science observations submitted by hikers. Predictions of suitable habitat for the Vancouver Island subspecies varied from 370 to 1039km2 based on field survey observations and from 404 to 1354km2 based on public observations. All models had fair accuracy (kappa{\textgreater}0.45) when tested on an independent dataset, but Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models tended to over-predict ptarmigan occurrence, had the lowest accuracy, and were most sensitive to the type of response data used. All the machine learning modeling techniques differed little between the datasets. These comparable results are encouraging for the continued use of citizen science monitoring programs, which can save both time and expense while involving and educating the public about threatened species. We advocate the use of opportunistic citizen science data and machine learning modeling techniques (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, and Maxent) for predicting alpine vertebrate species distributions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here, we develop predictive spatial models for the prevalence of these blood parasites in the olive sunbird (Cyanomitra olivacea). Since this species exhibits high natural parasite prevalence and occupies diverse habitats in tropical Africa, it represents a distinctive ecological model system for studying vector-borne pathogens. We used PCR and microscopy to screen for haematozoa from 28 sites in Central and West Africa. Species distribution models were constructed to associate ground-based and remotely sensed environmental variables with parasite presence. We then used machine-learning algorithm models to identify relationships between parasite prevalence and environmental predictors. Finally, predictive maps were generated by projecting model outputs to geographically unsampled areas. Results indicate that for Plasmodium spp., the maximum temperature of the warmest month was most important in predicting prevalence. For Trypanosoma spp., seasonal canopy moisture variability was the most important predictor. The models presented here visualize gradients of disease prevalence, identify pathogen hotspots and will be instrumental in studying the effects of ecological change on these and other pathogens. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Aim: Knowledge of species geographical distributions is critical for many ecological and evolutionary questions and underpins effective conservation decision-making, yet it is usually limited in spatial resolution or reliability. Over large spatial extents, range predictions are typically derived from expert knowledge or, increasingly, species distribution models based on individual occurrence records. Expert maps are useful at coarse resolution, where they are suitable for delineating unoccupied regions. In contrast, point records typically provide finer-scale occurrence information that can be characterized for its environmental association, but usually suffers from observer biases and does not representatively or fully address the geographical or environmental range occupied by a species. Innovation: We develop a new modelling methodology to combine the complementary informative attributes of both data types to improve fine-scale, large-extent predictions. We use expert delineations to constrain predictions of a species distribution model parameterized with incidental point occurrence records. We introduce a maximum entropy approach for combining the two data types and generalize it to Poisson point process models. We illustrate critical decision making during model construction using two detailed case studies and illustrate features more generally with applications to species with vastly different range and data attributes. Our methods are illustrated in the Supporting Information and with a new R package, bossMaps, that integrates with existing generalized linear modelling and Maxent software. Main conclusions: Our modelling strategy flexibly accommodates expert maps with different levels of bias and precision. The approach can also be useful with other coarse sources of spatially explicit information, including habitat associations, elevational bands or vegetation types. The flexible nature of this methodological innovation can support improved characterization of species distributions for a variety of applications and is being implemented as a standard element underpinning integrative species distribution predictions in the Map of Life (https://mol.org/). {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Delineating a species range is challenging because many factors interact at multiple spatial scales to affect a species distribution. Species distribution models (SDM) can be used to identify factors most associated with a species presence and, therefore, potentially define a range edge. We evaluated the utility of two popular SDM approaches, maximum entropy models (e.g., MaxEnt) and generalized linear models (GLM), for determining the range edge for the threatened Blanding's Turtles, Emydoidea blandingii, in northeastern New York, USA. Using the mapping and analysis software ArcGIS, we constructed and validated SDMs using presence/absence records (GLM) and presence/background records (MaxEnt) with 11 environmental predictor variables. Because of the limits imposed by the low number of absences, we found that GLM was not as successful as MaxEnt at predicting habitat suitability for rare and cryptic species like E. blandingii. Our results also indicated that a distinct environmentally induced range edge is associated with factors related to elevation. Both GLM and MaxEnt models also projected the presence of suitable habitat outside of the current range, including locations with known disjunct populations. We conclude that a presence/background SDM approach such as MaxEnt is valid when accurate data on locational absences are lacking, as is typical for rare, cryptic species. Using SDM to understand factors that shape the range edge can aid in planning habitat conservation and management of threatened species such as E. blandingii. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2016 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.},

Maxim. in the counties of northeast China. This information was used to identify priority areas for protection and provide protection and management recommendations within each studied county. The two species were mapped in 2884 study plots throughout this region over a 4-year period (38°40′N–53°30′N, 115°05′E–135°02′E). We used the species distribution models (Maxent), systematic conservation planning models (Marxan), and Geographic Information Systems (ArcGIS 10.0). The distributions of two species were correlated in the study area, enabling unique and economically viable joint conservation measures to be implemented. Three models were combined to identify feasible priority conservation sites. We used local spatial statistics to assess all identified conservation areas in relation to potential climate change based shifts in the geographic distribution of the two species. Model-based conservation strategies were used to identify effective measures to protect and utilize these two tree species in the study region. This study presents a novel technique for assessing wild plant distributions, in addition to serving as a model for the conservation of other species within the framework of general forest management, ecological construction, and geographical surveying. {\textcopyright} 2015, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Based on the data of forest lightning fires and environment variables, the MAXENT model was used to predict the lightning fire in Daxing'anling region. Firstly, we studied the collinear diagnostic of each environment variable, evaluated the importance of the environmental variables using training gain and the Jackknife method, and then evaluated the prediction accuracy of the MAXENT model using the max Kappa value and the AUC value. The results showed that the variance inflation factor (VIF) values of lightning energy and neutralized charge were 5.012 and 6.230, respectively. They were collinear with the other variables, so the model could not be used for training. Daily rainfall, the number of cloud-to-ground lightning, and current intensity of cloud-to-ground lightning were the three most important factors affecting the lightning fires in the forest, while the daily average wind speed and the slope was of less importance. With the increase of the proportion of test data, the max Kappa and AUC values were increased. The max Kappa values were above 0.75 and the average value was 0.772, while all of the AUC values were above 0.5 and the average value was 0.859. With a moderate level of prediction accuracy being achieved, the MAXENT model could be used to predict forest lightning fire in Daxing'anling Mountains.},

abstract = {Objectives: Statistical tools are effectively used to determine the distribution of mosquitoes and to make ecological inferences about the vector-borne disease dynamics. In this study, we utilised species distribution models to understand spatial patterns of Aedes aegypti in two dengue-prevalent regions of Pakistan, Lahore and Swat. Species distribution models can potentially indicate the probability of suitability of Ae. aegypti once introduced to new regions like Swat, where invasion of this species is a recent phenomenon. Methods: The distribution of Ae. aegypti was determined by applying the MaxEnt algorithm on a set of potential environmental factors and species sample records. The ecological dependency of species on each environmental variable was analysed using response curves. We quantified the statistical performance of the models based on accuracy assessment and spatial predictions. Results: Our results suggest that Ae. aegypti is widely distributed in Lahore. Human population density and urban infrastructure are primarily responsible for greater probability of mosquito occurrence in this region. In Swat, Ae. aegypti has clumped distribution, where urban patches provide refuge to the species in an otherwise hostile heterogeneous environment and road networks are assumed to have facilitated in passive-mediated dispersal of species. Conclusions: In Pakistan, Ae. aegypti is expanding its range northwards; this could be associated with rapid urbanisation, trade and travel. The main implication of this expansion is that more people are at risk of dengue fever in the northern highlands of Pakistan. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

The highly suitable predicted ranges varied in their ability to reflect the known distribution of the clades. The different analyses pointed towards different ecological preferences and significant ecological divergence in the four above-mentioned clades.

Improved mitigation site selection methods are needed to efficiently assess the suitability and quality of potential wetland mitigation sites at broad spatial scales. We present a novel application of maximum entropy-based predictive distribution models coupled with a patch-based ranking scheme to identify potential wetland mitigation sites and contrast their effectiveness relative to a conventional "expert opinion" model. We used hydrogeologic and landscape features and widely available wetland community distribution data to predict locations of wetlands that were previously unknown, destroyed, or biologically rare in the Upper Susquehanna River Basin in the northeastern United States. An "expert opinion" model predicted wetland occurrence based on topographic slope and soil type. Maximum entropy-based models predicted an independent sample of wetland locations well (Area Under the Curve=0.86-0.98; 92 {\%} correct classification rate) and dramatically outperformed the "expert opinion" model (62 {\%} correct classification rate). A patch-based ranking scheme, which incorporated additional influences on wetland quality, ranked sites with biologically important wetland plant communities highly among model-identified wetlands. We conclude that integration of maximum entropy-based predictive modeling and patch-based ranking can effectively identify high quality wetland mitigation sites. {\textcopyright} Society of Wetland Scientists 2012.},

abstract = {Aim: Climate changes are thought to be responsible for the retreat and eventual extinction of subtropical lauroid species that covered much of Europe and North Africa during the Palaeogene and early Neogene; little is known, however, of the spatial and temporal patterns of this demise. Herein we calibrate ecological niche models to assess the climatic requirements of Laurus L. (Lauraceae), an emblematic relic from the Tethyan subtropical flora, subsequently using these models to infer how the range dynamics of Laurus were affected by Plio-Pleistocene climate changes. We also provide predictions of likely range changes resulting from future climatic scenarios. Location: The Mediterranean Basin and Macaronesian islands (Canaries, Madeira, Azores). Methods: We used a maximum-entropy algorithm (Maxent)to model the relationship between climate and Laurus distribution over time. The models were fitted both to the present and to the middle Pliocene, based on fossil records. We employed climatic reconstructions for the mid-Pliocene (3 Ma), the Last Glacial Maximum (21 ka) and a CO2-doubling future scenario to project putative species distribution in each period. We validated the model projections with Laurus fossil and present occurrences. Results: Laurus preferentially occupied warm and moist areas with low seasonality, showing a marked stasis of its climatic niche. Models fitted to Pliocene conditions successfully predicted the current species distribution. Large suitable areas existed during the Pliocene, which were strongly reduced during the Pleistocene, but humid refugia within the Mediterranean Basin and Macaronesian islands enabled long-term persistence. Future climate conditions are likely to re-open areas suitable for colonization north of the current range. Main conclusions: The climatic requirements of Laurus remained virtually unchanged over the last 3 Myr. This marked niche conservatism imposed largely deterministic range dynamics driven by climate conditions. This species's relatively high drought tolerance might account for the survival of Laurus in continental Europe throughout the Quaternary whilst other Lauraceae became extinct. Climatic scenarios for the end of this century would favour an expansion of the species's range towards northern latitudes, while severely limiting southern populations due to increased water stress. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract = {Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling, as implemented in the Maxent software, has rapidly become one of the most popular methods for distribution modelling. Originally, MaxEnt was described as a machine-learning method. More recently, it has been explained from principles of Bayesian estimation. MaxEnt offers numerous options (variants of the method) and settings (tuning of parameters) to the users. A widespread practice of accepting the Maxent software's default options and settings has been established, most likely because of ecologists' lack of familiarity with machine-learning and Bayesian statistical concepts and the ease by which the default models are obtained in Maxent. However, these defaults have been shown, in many cases, to be suboptimal and exploration of alternatives has repeatedly been called for. In this paper, we derive MaxEnt from strict maximum likelihood principles, and point out parallels between MaxEnt and standard modelling tools like generalised linear models (GLM). Furthermore, we describe several new options opened by this new derivation of MaxEnt, which may improve MaxEnt practice. The most important of these is the option for selecting variables by subset selection methods instead of the ℓ1-regularisation method, which currently is the Maxent software default. Other new options include: incorporation of new transformations of explanatory variables and user control of the transformation process; improved variable contribution measures and options for variation partitioning; and improved output prediction formats. The new options are exemplified for a data set for the plant species Scorzonera humilis in SE Norway, which was analysed by the standard MaxEnt procedure in a previously published paper. We recommend that thorough comparisons between the proposed alternative options and default procedures and variants thereof be carried out. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Non-native pests and pathogens present serious challenges to the management of forested ecosystems around the world. Early detection of pest and pathogen invasions may allow timely control and prevention methods to be implemented. Species distribution models (SDMs) and remote sensing (RS) methods have both been used effectively to determine locations of pest and pathogen damage. However, previous work integrating these two methods has rarely used RS metrics that have biological meaning. We use RS difference indices that show changes in forest cover from defoliation in order to map Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae, locations using MaxEnt in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area (DWGNRA). Brightness, greenness, wetness, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images for December 1982 and 2010. A difference for each index was created by subtracting the 1982 value from the 2010 value. We compared two models, one using difference indices and the other using 2010 indices along with other ancillary data layers, to determine if the more complicated but more biologically relevant difference indices were necessary for improved model performance. Variables with low importance were removed from both models, leaving NDVI, Wetness, soil, and elevation in the two final models. The difference model had an improvement in accuracy of three percent, across a number of threshold values. Despite this small difference in accuracy, however, the infected area predicted by the difference model (5.1{\%} of total area) was approximately 1/2 of that predicted by the single year model (9.6{\%} of total area). These results suggest that using remote sensing difference indices improves model accuracy slightly in terms of errors of omission, but also decreases predicted area of forest infestation by about 50{\%}, suggesting that errors of commission would be substantially reduced using the difference approach. This method can provide forest managers more accurate information on the best locations to sample and treat. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Our understanding of how species will respond to global change is still limited. Reasons hindering our ability to forecast species range shifts and expansions are the mismatch between realized climate niches in species' native and invasive ranges, and the lack of available climatic datasets offering multiple scales of climatic variability (e.g., monthly and inter-annual climatic variability). Here we present a multi-taxon analysis of invasive species niche transferability that considers multi-scale climatic variability using ten noxious terrestrial invasive species. We compare native versus invasive ranges in geographic space as estimated using the species distribution modeling (SDM) algorithm Maxent, and the comparative index Hellinger's I with three possible climatic layer configurations representing natural climatic variability: (1) inter-annual, (2) monthly and (3) a combination of inter-annual and monthly climatic variability. We assess model performance using the area under the receiver characteristic curve (AUC). Results show that combined scales of climatic variability improved performance of the models for 60{\%} of the species in the native range and 70{\%} of the species in the invaded range. Contrasting native and invaded range SDM performance showed that the same climate layer configuration produced the best models only in 70{\%} of the species. For 90{\%} of the species the most similar niches were obtained based on monthly climatic variability. The divergence in our findings between higher performing SDMs and the most transferable SDMs, suggest some species range limits might be constrained by one scale of climatic variability in the native range and a different one in the invaded range. Where sufficient occurrence data in the invaded range is available, the inclusion of an additional scale of climatic variability can enhance ecological understanding of the invasion events. However, when invaded range occurrence data is not available, the most conservative approach would use only monthly climatic variability. If these finding are extrapolated to niche transferability in time, we suggest that historical collection records should be analyzed to understand species' response to multiple scales of climate variability in the past, thereby informing the selection of appropriate scales of climate variability in the future. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We developed potential suitability models using two algorithms for a threatened African mahogany, Entandrophragma angolense, in three East African countries; Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The effect of features selection and modelling algorithm selection on potential suitability predictions was explored. Occurrence records and high-resolution environmental data were used. The two species distribution modelling techniques were genetic algorithm rule for prediction; and maximum entropy modelling. With Maxent, the area under the receiver characteristic operating curve (AUC) for potential distribution models tested on independent data ranged from 0.942 to 0.972 when using automatic features and from 0.974 to 0.666 with target or specific features. With GARP, AUC for potential distribution models ranged from 0.591 to 0.736 with all rule types and from 0.388 to 0.805 for specific rule types (Tables and ). The area under the E. angolense potential suitability was best predicted by soil, rainfall and aspect using GARP. Potential suitability increased with increasing aspect and decreased with increasing slope. Low rainfall and elevation increased potential suitability, while high levels of either variable decreased potential suitability. Potential suitability maps for vulnerable species require using a multi-algorithm, fine scale data approach and incorporation of environmental variables like soil, slope, land use and elevation. Species distribution models can offer insight on the distribution requirements of vulnerable species and help guide the development of management plans. Results of this study suggest that E. angolense management plans should promote the protection of terrestrial forests surrounding water bodies including Mabira forest in Uganda. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Management of human activities which impact the seafloor in the deep ocean is becoming increasingly important as bottom trawling and exploration for minerals, oil, and gas continue to extend into regions where fragile ecosystems containing habitat-forming deep-sea corals and sponges may be found. Spatial management of these vulnerable marine ecosystems requires accurate knowledge of their distribution. Predictive habitat suitability modelling, using species presence data and a suite of environmental predictor variables, has emerged as a useful tool for inferring distributions outside of known areas. However, validation of model predictions is typically performed with non-independent data. In this study, we describe the results of habitat suitability models constructed for four deep-sea reef-forming coral species across a large region of the South Pacific Ocean using MaxEnt and Boosted Regression Tree modelling approaches. In order to validate model predictions we conducted a photographic survey on a set of seamounts in an un-sampled area east of New Zealand. The likelihood of habitat suitable for reef-forming corals on these seamounts was predicted to be variable, but very high in some regions, particularly where levels of aragonite saturation, dissolved oxygen, and particulate organic carbon were optimal. However, the observed frequency of coral occurrence in analyses of survey photographic data was much lower than expected, and patterns of observed versus predicted coral distribution were not highly correlated. The poor performance of these broad-scale models is attributed to lack of recorded species absences to inform the models, low precision of global bathymetry models, and lack of data on the geomorphology and substrate of the seamounts at scales appropriate to the modelled taxa. This demonstrates the need to use caution when interpreting and applying broad-scale, presence-only model results for fisheries management and conservation planning in data poor areas of the deep sea. Future improvements in the predictive performance of broad-scale models will rely on the continued advancement in modelling of environmental predictor variables, refinements in modelling approaches to deal with missing or biased inputs, and incorporation of true absence data. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.},

abstract = {Selection of sites for successful restoration of impacted shellfish populations depends on understanding the dispersion capability and habitat requirements of the species involved. In Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, the horse mussel (Modiolus modiolus) biogenic reefs cover only a fraction of their historical range with the remaining reefs badly damaged and requiring restoration. Previous experimental trials suggest that translocation of horse mussels accelerates reef recovery and has therefore been proposed as a suitable restoration technique. We used a series of coupled hydrodynamic and particle dispersal models to assess larval dispersion from remnant and translocated populations to identify suitable areas for adult live M. modiolus translocation in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland. A maximum entropy model (MAXENT) was used to identify if dispersing larvae could reach habitat suitable for adult M. modiolus. From these we predicted if translocated mussels will reseed themselves or be able to act as larval sources for nearby reefs. The dispersal models showed that the remnant M. modiolus populations are largely self-recruiting with little connectivity between them. The majority of larvae settled near the sources and movement was largely dependent on the tides and not influenced by wind or waves. Higher reef elevation resulted in larvae being able to disperse further away from the release point. However, larval numbers away from the source population are likely to be too low for successful recruitment. There was also little connectivity between the Irish Sea and Strangford Lough as any larvae entering the Lough remained predominantly in the Strangford Narrows. The areas covered by these self-seeding populations are suitable for M. modiolus translocation according to the MAXENT model. As a result of this work and in conjunction with other field work we propose a combination of total protection of all remaining larval sources and small scale translocations onto suitable substrata in each of the identified self-recruiting areas. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {New records of the spider Chibchea salta Huber 2000 (Araneae, Pholcidae) from northwestern Argentina are provided, and the potential range of this species is modeled. Two presence-only methods, Maxent and Bioclim, were run using 19 bioclimatic parameters at a resolution of 30 arc seconds. The climatic profile of C. salta is described, and the relative importance of the bioclimatic variables is explored. Temperature variables proved to be more decisive to the final range shape. The range predicted with Maxent is slightly larger than with Bioclim, but the latter appears to be more sensitive to the record set bias. Both methods performed well, resulting in predictive ranges consistent with the yungas ecoregion. These results provide an initial insight into the bioclimatic tolerance of C. salta, and by identifying potential areas with no records, such as the sierras on the Salta-Jujuy border, they also help in identifying sites for future sampling efforts.},

abstract = {Submarine canyons have been shown to positively influence pelagic and benthic biodiversity and ecosystem function. In the eastern Bering Sea, several immense canyons lie under the highly productive "green belt" along the continental slope. Two of these, Pribilof and Zhemchug canyons, are the focus of current conservation interest. We used a maximum entropy modeling approach to evaluate the importance of these two canyons, as well as canyons in general, as habitat for gorgonian (alcyonacean) corals, pennatulacean corals, and sponges, in an area comprising most of the eastern Bering Sea slope and outer shelf. These invertebrates create physical structure that is a preferred habitat for many mobile species, including commercially important fish and invertebrates. We show that Pribilof canyon is a hotspot of structure-forming invertebrate habitat, containing over 50{\%} of estimated high-quality gorgonian habitat and 45{\%} of sponge habitat, despite making up only 1.7{\%} of the total study area. The amount of quality habitat for gorgonians and sponges varied in other canyons, but canyons overall contained more high-quality habitat for structure-forming invertebrates compared to other slope areas. Bottom trawling effort was not well correlated with habitat quality for structure-forming invertebrates, and bottom-contact fishing effort in general, including longlining and trawling, was not particularly concentrated in the canyons examined. These results suggest that if conserving gorgonian coral habitat is a management goal, canyons, particularly Pribilof Canyon, may be a prime location to do this without excessive impact on fisheries. {\textcopyright} 2015.},

abstract = {Context: Multispecies and multiscale habitat suitability models (HSM) are important to identify the environmental variables and scales influencing habitat selection and facilitate the comparison of closely related species with different ecological requirements. Objectives: This study explores the multiscale relationships of habitat suitability for the pine (Martes martes) and stone marten (M. foina) in northern Spain to evaluate differences in habitat selection and scaling, and to determine if there is habitat niche displacement when both species coexist. Methods: We combined bivariate scaling and maximum entropy modeling to compare the multiscale habitat selection of the two martens. To optimize the HSM, the performance of three sampling bias correction methods at four spatial scales was explored. HSMs were compared to explore niche differentiation between species through a niche identity test. Results: The comparison among HSMs resulted in the detection of a significant niche divergence between species. The pine marten was positively associated with cooler mountainous areas, low levels of human disturbance, high proportion of natural forests and well-connected forestry plantations, and medium-extent agroforestry mosaics. The stone marten was positively related to the density of urban areas, the proportion and extensiveness of croplands, the existence of some scrub cover and semi-continuous grasslands. Conclusions: This study outlines the influence of the spatial scale and the importance of the sampling bias corrections in HSM, and to our knowledge, it is the first comparing multiscale habitat selection and niche divergence of two related marten species. This study provides a useful methodological framework for multispecies and multiscale comparatives. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Objectives Detailed and reliable information about the spatial distribution of species provides important information for species conservation management, especially in the case of rare species of conservation interest. We aimed to study the consequences of climate change on geographical distributions of the tertiary rare tree species Thuja sutchuenensis Franch. (Cupressaceae) to provide reference for conservation management of this species, including priority area selection for introduction and cultivation of the species. We expect that this approach could be promising in predicting the potential distribution of other rare tree species, and as such can be an effective tool in rare tree species restoration and conservation planning, especially species with narrow distribution or raw presence-only occurrence data. Methods 107 records covering the whole distribution range of T. sutchuenensis in the Daba Mountains were obtained during a 3-year field survey. The principle of maximum entropy (Maxent) was used to model the species' potential distribution area under paleoclimate, current and future climate background. Results The Maxent model was highly accurate with a statistically significant AUC value of 0.998, which is higher than 0.5 of a null model; The location of the potential distribution for the last interglacial period is in southeastern China, with the largest optimal habitat area being only 1666 km2. In other periods, the central location of the potential distribution is accordant with the real present distribution, but the model's predicted optimal habitat area is outside the current distribution. Conclusions Our findings can be applied in various ways such as the identification of additional localities where T. sutchuenensis may already exist, but has not yet been detected; the recognition of localities where it is likely to spread to; the priority selection area for introduction and cultivation and the conservation management of such rare tree species. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors},

In this study, the effects of climate change on Egyptian reptiles were investigated for the first time using species distribution models. Maxent was used to model the current and future distributions of suitable habitats for 75 terrestrial reptile species from Egypt. The modelled distribution for current suitable conditions for each species was projected into the future at three time slices using two emission scenarios from four global circulation models and under two assumptions of dispersal ability. Climate change is expected to vary in its effects spatially, with some areas characterized by increased species richness while others show declines. Future range changes vary among species and different future projections, from the entire loss to large gains in range. Two species were expected to become extinct in at least one future projection, and eight species were expected to lose {\textgreater}80{\%} of their current distribution. Although Protected Areas have greater conservation value, on average, compared to unprotected areas, they appear inadequate to conserve Egyptian reptiles under expected climate change. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The coral fauna of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) is depauperate and peripheral; hence, it has drawn attention to the factors allowing its survival. Here, we use a genetic seascape approach and ecological niche modeling to unravel the environmental factors correlating with the genetic variation of Porites panamensis, a hermatypic coral endemic to the ETP. Specifically, we test if levels of diversity and connectivity are higher among abundant than among depauperate populations, as expected by a geographically relaxed version of the Abundant Center Hypothesis (rel-ACH). Unlike the original ACH, referring to a geographical center of distribution of maximal abundance, the rel-ACH refers only to a center of maximum abundance, irrespective of its geographic position. The patterns of relative abundance of P. panamensis in the Mexican Pacific revealed that northern populations from Baja California represent its center of abundance; and southern depauperate populations along the continental margin are peripheral relative to it. Genetic patterns of diversity and structure of nuclear DNA sequences (ribosomal DNA and a single copy open reading frame) and five alloenzymatic loci partially agreed with rel-ACH predictions. We found higher diversity levels in peninsular populations and significant differentiation between peninsular and continental colonies. In addition, continental populations showed higher levels of differentiation and lower connectivity than peninsular populations in the absence of isolation by distance in each region. Some discrepancies with model expectations may relate to the influence of significant habitat discontinuities in the face of limited dispersal potential. Environmental data analyses and niche modeling allowed us to identify temperature, water clarity, and substrate availability as the main factors correlating with patterns of abundance, genetic diversity, and structure, which may hold the key to the survival of P. panamensis in the face of widespread environmental degradation. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

In the savannahs they are the most important family in terms of abundance and species richness, in other habitats, such as gallery forests, there are only few species. On the country scale there is a change in growth form: while in the Sahelian north most grasses are small therophytes, the Sudanian south is characterized by tall, often perennial grasses. To analyse these patterns in detail, we compiled a database on grass occurrences and used it in an ecological niche modelling approach with the programme Maxent to obtain country-wide distribution models. Secondly we used data on photosynthetic type, height, leaf width and growth form to aggregate the species distributions and quantified the relative importance of functional groups per grid cell. Pronounced latitudinal differences could be shown for life forms, photosynthesis and size: the drier north is characterized by smaller, mainly therophytic grasses with a high share of C4 NAD-ME photosynthesis, while the more humid south is characterized by tall, often hemicryptophytic grasses with C4 NADP-ME photosynthesis. For leaf width, no clear country-wide patterns could be observed, but local differences with more broad-leaved grasses in humid areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The latest distribution map from the IUCN Red List suggests that the tapirs' native range is becom-ing increasingly fragmented in Peninsular Malaysia, but distribution data collected by local researchers sug-gest a more extensive geographical range. Here, we compile a database of 1261 tapir occurrence records within Peninsular Malaysia, and demonstrate that this species, indeed, has a much broader geographical range than the IUCN range map suggests. However, extreme spatial and temporal bias in these records limits their utility for conservation planning. Therefore, we used maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling to elucidate the potential ex-tent of the Asian tapir's occurrence in Peninsular Malaysia while accounting for bias in existing distribution data. Our MaxEnt model predicted that the Asian tapir has a wider geographic range than our fine-scale data and the IUCN range map both suggest. Approximately 37{\%} of Peninsular Malaysia contains potentially suit-able tapir habitats. Our results justify a revision to the Asian tapir's extent of occurrence in the IUCN Red List. Furthermore, our modeling demonstrated that selectively logged forests encompass 45{\%} of potentially suitable tapir habitats, underscoring the importance of these habitats for the conservation of this species in Peninsular Malaysia. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd, ISZS and IOZ/CAS.},

abstract = {Rising temperatures are predicted to melt all perennial ice cover in the Arctic by the end of this century, thus opening up suitable habitat for temperate and subarctic species. Canopy-forming seaweeds provide an ideal system to predict the potential impact of climate-change on rocky-shore ecosystems, given their direct dependence on temperature and their key role in the ecological system. Our primary objective was to predict the climate-change induced range-shift of Fucus distichus, the dominant canopy-forming macroalga in the Arctic and subarctic rocky intertidal. More specifically, we asked: which Arctic/subarctic and cold-temperate shores of the northern hemisphere will display the greatest distributional change of F. distichus and how will this affect niche overlap with seaweeds from temperate regions? We used the program MAXENT to develop correlative ecological niche models with dominant range-limiting factors and 169 occurrence records. Using three climate-change scenarios, we projected habitat suitability of F. distichus - and its niche overlap with three dominant temperate macroalgae - until year 2200. Maximum sea surface temperature was identified as the most important factor in limiting the fundamental niche of F. distichus. Rising temperatures were predicted to have low impact on the species' southern distribution limits, but to shift its northern distribution limits poleward into the high Arctic. In cold-temperate to subarctic regions, new areas of niche overlap were predicted between F. distichus and intertidal macroalgae immigrating from the south. While climate-change threatens intertidal seaweeds in warm-temperate regions, seaweed meadows will likely flourish in the Arctic intertidal. Although this enriches biodiversity and opens up new seaweed-harvesting grounds, it will also trigger unpredictable changes in the structure and functioning of the Arctic intertidal ecosystem. This manuscript addresses the question: Which rocky shores of the North Atlantic, Arctic, and North Pacific will display the greatest distributional change of F. distichus and how will this affect niche overlap with seaweeds from temperate regions? Our Ecological Niche Models predict rising temperatures to have low impact on the species' southern distribution limits, but to shift its northern distribution limits poleward into the high Arctic and to create new areas of niche overlap with intertidal macroalgae immigrating from the south. Although this enriches biodiversity and opens up new seaweed-harvesting grounds, it will also trigger unpredictable changes in the structure and functioning of the Arctic intertidal ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2016 Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {The socio-economic factors are of key importance during all phases of wildfire management that include prevention, suppression and restoration. However, modeling these factors, at the proper spatial and temporal scale to understand fire regimes is still challenging. This study analyses socio-economic drivers of wildfire occurrence in central Spain. This site represents a good example of how human activities play a key role over wildfires in the European Mediterranean basin. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and machine learning Maximum Entropy models (Maxent) predicted wildfire occurrence in the 1980s and also in the 2000s to identify changes between each period in the socio-economic drivers affecting wildfire occurrence. GLM base their estimation on wildfire presence-absence observations whereas Maxent on wildfire presence-only. According to indicators like sensitivity or commission error Maxent outperformed GLM in both periods. It achieved a sensitivity of 38.9{\%} and a commission error of 43.9{\%} for the 1980s, and 67.3{\%}and 17.9{\%}for the 2000s. Instead, GLM obtained 23.33, 64.97, 9.41 and 18.34{\%}, respectively. However GLM performed steadier than Maxent in terms of the overall fit. Both models explained wildfires from predictors such as population density and Wildland Urban Interface (WUI), but differed in their relative contribution. As a result of the urban sprawl and an abandonment of rural areas, predictors like WUI and distance to roads increased their contribution to both models in the 2000s, whereas Forest-Grassland Interface (FGI) influence decreased. This study demonstrates that human component can be modelled with a spatio-temporal dimension to integrate it into wildfire risk assessment. {\textcopyright} 2016 Vilar et al.

abstract = {Regional analysis of large wildfire potential given climate change scenarios is crucial to understanding areas most at risk in the future, yet wildfire models are not often developed and tested at this spatial scale. We fit three historical climate suitability models for large wildfires (i.e. ≥ 400 ha) in Colorado and Wyoming using topography and decadal climate averages corresponding to wildfire occurrence at the same temporal scale. The historical models classified points of known large wildfire occurrence with high accuracies. Using a novel approach in wildfire modeling, we applied the historical models to independent climate and wildfire datasets, and the resulting sensitivities were 0.75, 0.81, and 0.83 for Maxent, Generalized Linear, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, respectively. We projected the historic models into future climate space using data from 15 global circulation models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios. Maps from these geospatial analyses can be used to evaluate the changing spatial distribution of climate suitability of large wildfires in these states. April relative humidity was the most important covariate in all models, providing insight to the climate space of large wildfires in this region. These methods incorporate monthly and seasonal climate averages at a spatial resolution relevant to land management (i.e. 1 km2) and provide a tool that can be modified for other regions of North America, or adapted for other parts of the world. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Summary Eleonora's Falcon is a long-distance migrant of the Palearctic region. In recent years, the advent of satellite telemetry has enabled a more detailed investigation of the species's migratory and wintering periods. In this study, we model the distribution pattern of four Eleonora's Falcons originating from Greece within their wintering grounds in Madagascar with the use of satellite telemetry data and a niche-based technique, Maxent. The model predicted few highly suitable areas for the occurrence of the species, restricted to elevated areas receiving large amounts of precipitation during the wintering period, containing patches of primary and degraded humid submontane forests as well as cultivation. Most of these areas occurred within the previously estimated home ranges of the four falcons, as well as of three falcons from another independent study. Taking into account the ongoing alterations in landscape structure that occur within the eastern rainforest region of Madagascar, we believe that it is imperative to better understand the ecological requirements of Eleonora's Falcon. To this end, we recommend the application of Maxent in the study of habitat selection of the species that could be further refined with the inclusion of biotic interactions and seasonal resource availability. {\textcopyright} BirdLife International 2013.},

abstract = {The rufous-necked hornbill, Aceros nipalensis (Hodgson, 1829), is listed as vulnerable and is found only in the Western Forest Complex. The objectives of this research were: 1) to estimate the geographical distribution for the rufous-necked hornbill at the Thung Yai-Huai Kha Khaeng World Heritage Site in both the breeding and non-breeding seasons; and 2) to determine seasonal changes in its habitat use. We collated the occurrence records of the rufous-necked hornbill from long-term monitoring data and conducted additional surveys during 2004-2008. In addition, spatial layers for potential environmental variables that might affect hornbill distribution were developed and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modelling technique was used to generate potential distributions. The results indicated that MaxEnt models performed very well and the overall accuracies of the predicted maps in breeding and non-breeding seasons derived from the contingency matrix were 81{\%} and 85{\%} respectively. In addition, altitude and land cover were considered signifi cant variables in the species distribution model. Suitable habitats for the rufous-necked hornbill were predicted in the high altitude evergreen forest and were clustered into three patches in the center of Thung Yai Naresuan West, Huai Kha Khaeng, and along the western boundary of Huai Kha Khaeng adjoining Thung Yai Naresuan East. Suitable habitats covered 11.7{\%} of the world heritage site, of which 6.6{\%} and 9.2{\%} were in the breeding and non-breeding seasons respectively, owing to the fact that the home range during breeding season is smaller compared to non-breeding season. Future conservation efforts should focus on enhancing the connectivity between suitable large and small patches within the distribution range, the installation of artifi cial nests, and patrolling to minimise poaching. {\textcopyright} National University of Singapore.},

abstract = {Climate change presents a new challenge for the management of invasive exotic species that threaten both biodiversity and agricultural productivity. The invasion of exotic perennial grasses throughout the globe is particularly problematic given their impacts on a broad range of native plant communities and livelihoods. As the climate continues to change, pre-emptive long-term management strategies for exotic grasses will become increasingly important. Using species distribution modelling we investigated potential changes to the location of climatically suitable habitat for some exotic perennial grass species currently in Australia, under a range of future climate scenarios for the decade centred around 2050. We focus on eleven species shortlisted or declared as the Weeds of National Significance or Alert List species in Australia, which have also become successful invaders in other parts of the world. Our results indicate that the extent of climatically suitable habitat available for all of the exotic grasses modelled is projected to decrease under climate scenarios for 2050. This reduction is most severe for the three species of Needle Grass (genus Nassella) that currently have infestations in the south-east of the continent. Combined with information on other aspects of establishment risk (e. g. demographic rates, human-use, propagule pressure), predictions of reduced climatic suitability provide justification for re-assessing which weeds are prioritised for intensive management as the climate changes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Background: Characterizing the interface between wild and domestic animal populations is increasingly recognized as essential in the context of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) that are transmitted by wildlife. More specifically, the spatial and temporal distribution of contact rates between wild and domestic hosts is a key parameter for modeling EIDs transmission dynamics. We integrated satellite telemetry, remote sensing and ground-based surveys to evaluate the spatio-temporal dynamics of indirect contacts between wild and domestic birds to estimate the risk that avian pathogens such as avian influenza and Newcastle viruses will be transmitted between wildlife to poultry. We monitored comb ducks (Sarkidiornis melanotos melanotos) with satellite transmitters for seven months in an extensive Afro-tropical wetland (the Inner Niger Delta) in Mali and characterise the spatial distribution of backyard poultry in villages. We modelled the spatial distribution of wild ducks using 250-meter spatial resolution and 8-days temporal resolution remotely-sensed environmental indicators based on a Maxent niche modelling method.Results: Our results show a strong seasonal variation in potential contact rate between wild ducks and poultry. We found that the exposure of poultry to wild birds was greatest at the end of the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season, when comb ducks disperse from natural water bodies to irrigated areas near villages.Conclusions: Our study provides at a local scale a quantitative evidence of the seasonal variability of contact rate between wild and domestic bird populations. It illustrates a GIS-based methodology for estimating epidemiological contact rates at the wildlife and livestock interface integrating high-resolution satellite telemetry and remote sensing data. {\textcopyright} 2011 Cappelle et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Species distribution modeling is one of the most effective habitat analysis methods for wildlife conservation. We evaluated the sensitivity of species distribution modeling to different grain sizes and extent sizes from 30m to 4950m using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling. The grain size represents a unit for analysis, whereas the extent size defines the scope of the analysis in a way that reflects the environmental data for the area in which the species of interest occurs. We compared the resulting suitability indexes and habitat areas based on two approaches. The first approach increases the extent size for a fixed grain size. The second approach increases the grain size and the extent size by equal amounts. The suitability index based on the first approach (R2=0.34) was greater than the suitability index based on the second approach (R2=0.89). The first approach was fitted to a logarithmic function with a critical point at approximately 0.5km, converging to about 0.76. In contrast, the second approach showed a linear decrease to values less than 0.5. The distribution of habitat area found with the second method (R2=0.87) was broader than that found with the first method (R2=0.63). The relationship between the extent size and the landscape index of the first method can be displayed as a power-law graph with a critical point of 0.5km. The method of expanding extent size has greater accuracy, although the time that it requires for data processing is long. The results of this study suggest that the maximum grain size should be approximately 1.5km. If the grain size is greater than 1.5km, the accuracy of the habitat suitability index decreases below 0.6, and the predicted habitat suitability increases dramatically. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) play an important role in the conservation of valuable forest resources, and an increasing number of areas are being designated as PAs worldwide. However, climate change could drive endangered forest plants out of PAs, and impact the function of PAs to conserve endangered forest plants. Hence, it is necessary for conservation biologists to put forward a simple method to evaluate the ability of PAs to conserve endangered forest plants. Here, we studied 61 endangered forest plants from three ecoregions in China. We applied species distribution modeling to project suitable habitats of endangered forest plants, and used geographical information system to compute whether PAs could support the conservation of endangered forest plants. With climate change caused by increasing gas concentration, the overall ability of PAs to support the conservation of endangered forest plants will likely decrease compared to the conservation needs of ecoregions. We found that PAs have varying abilities to conserve endangered forest plants in different ecoregions. For temperate broadleaf mixed forests and tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, we found that climate change will decrease the PAs' ability to support the conservation of endangered forest plants effectively in the existing forest landscape. In contrast, we found that temperate conifer forests will likely remain effective. Using this information, we proposed the conservation plans for different ecoregions under climate change. For PAs with limited ability to support the conservation of endangered forest plants in an ecoregion, we recommend expanding the areas of forests and PAs based on the suitable habitats of the endangered forest plants. For PAs with stable ability to support the conservation of endangered forest plants in an ecoregion, we recommend expanding the conservation areas in PAs. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This study aims to model the distribution of B. glabrata and B. straminea in schistosomiasis non-endemic areas of the metropolitan region of Recife (MRR) based on environmental data and estimates of snail distributions in endemic and neighbouring areas. We applied Kriging with the aim of determining the spatial distribution of these two snail species and MaxEnt for modelling their ecological behaviour. Kriging showed that the North and the Centre of the MRR were generally either snail-free or contained only B. straminea, while both snail species could be found in the South. MaxEnt supported our observation that the northern and southern coastal regions were favoured by B. glabrata and diurnal mean temperature variation; July rainfall and November rainfall were the three variables favouring Biomphalaria breeding sites that contributed the most in the predictive model we developed. The study showed the location of areas suitable to Biomphalaria spp. and therefore at potential risk, first for invasion of these snails and later for the development of new schistosomiasis-endemic areas. This information should be useful, not only to estimate expansion possibilities of this disease in the MRR, but also to point out the climatic variables that would contribute to this expansion, thereby allowing timely application of prevention and control measures. {\textcopyright} V.

abstract = {Climate change has the potential to severely threaten endangered tree species. These species are important and sometimes dominant elements of natural communities. We conducted four years of field surveys to identify the distributions of endangered tree species present in the forests of north-eastern China. We conducted a detailed investigation of 1886 study plots and selected seven endangered trees (each with a total of ≥5 records) for further analysis. We modelled and mapped the distributions of potentially suitable climatic habitat for these species using the case of north-eastern China. We then developed a method that uses a combination of a species distribution model and geographic information system (GIS) to evaluate the ability of nature reserves to protect endangered tree species from disruptions caused by climate change. We found that the locations of suitable habitats for the seven endangered trees would shift variously according to different emissions scenarios and that this would result in a change in the effectiveness of each nature reserve to conserve the trees. Hence, emissions scenarios that result in increased amounts of suitable habitat give those nature reserves a strong ability to protect endangered trees. Emissions scenarios that result in decreased amounts of suitable land will decrease the ability of some nature reserves to protect endangered trees. Some of the tree species may be able to adapt to climate change, allowing the trees to survive in many of the nature reserves, but some may not. Ultimately, our method assesses the ability of nature reserves to protect endangered trees effectively and is a methodology that can be applied to any endangered species requiring planning for future protection and management. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

These two were the annual mean temperature and the maximum temperature in the warmest month of the year. All of the models used in this study reached AUC values of above 0.9 (RF (AUC = 1), GBM (AUC = 0.99), MARS (AUC = 0.98), GLM (AUC = 0.97), and Maxent (AUC = 0.95)), indicating good overall prediction accuracy. The accuracy of random forest (RF) was the highest. The most suitable areas for the presence of this species in Iran were located in Bushehr, Khuzestan, southern Ilam, and western Kermanshah provinces. Furthermore, we modeled the extent of the suitable areas under a climate change scenario, where the results showed a potential increase in the area of suitable habitats for the species in the future.

Based on the forest fire ignition data in Heilongjiang Province in 1996-2006, and by using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Maximum Entropy Models (Maxent), this paper analyzed the factors controlling the forest fire occurrence in the Province, including topography, human activity, and land vegetation type, and compared the modeling accuracy, variable importance, and ignition probability map. Both the GLM and the Maxent had intermediate predictive performance, with the Maxent performed slightly better. Overall, the variables related to human activities were the most important predictors of forest fire ignition locations, followed by topographical variables. Despite the two models had similar modeling accuracy, the ignition probability map generated by Maxent was noticeably different from that generated by GLM. It was suggested that to make a comparison of or to selectively assemble different type models to produce integrated prediction results would be more desirable to more accurately identify the hotspots of forest fire occurrence, and thus, to provide more reasonable and higher efficient comments for forest fire prevention.},

The principal regulated pests are the big avocado seed weevil, Heilipus lauri Boheman; the small avocado seed weevils Conotrachelus aguacatae Barber and C. perseae Barber; the branch borer weevil, Copturus aguacatae Kissinger (all Coleoptera: Curculionidae); and the avocado seed moth, Stenoma catenifer Walsingham (Lepidoptera: Elachistidae). In Mexico, distribution information of these pests is largely based on a slow integration of the geographic data. This study was conducted to determine the potential distribution of these 5 insect pests in Mexican avocadogrowing areas by using the maximum entropy algorithm. Distributional data of these insects were obtained from scientific literature, databases, and field collection, and incorporated into the MaxEnt model using 19 global climatic variables and elevation data. Distributional models for Mexico, and geographic interaction with avocado-growing areas of the country, were calculated. Conoctrachelus aguacatae, C. perseae, Copturus aguacatae, and H. lauri showed similar environmental suitability patterns in Mexico, with a potential distribution from central to southern Mexico. High suitability was projected principally in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and surrounding biogeographic provinces. Stenoma catenifer exhibited an irregular environmental suitability pattern, with preference for western Mexico. Altitude, isothermality, and seasonality of precipitation were the variables that most influenced potential distribution of analyzed species. Geographic interaction with avocado-growing areas ranged from wider (Conoctrachelus aguacatae, C. perseae, Copturus aguacatae, and S. catenifer) to narrow or irregular (H. lauri), but the last species has the potential to invade new geographic areas. For the first time, the geographic distribution of these 5 insect pests was determined based on environmental suitability and their geographic interaction with avocados. These data could support development of management strategies throughout the country, and help focusing surveys and control tactics.},

Here, we applied methods dedicated to species distribution modelling (SDM) to map an integrated index in India's Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, the endemic tree richness, and to use it for recommendations of protected areas. We then rigorously compared SDM results with spatially explicit and multiscale comparison tools, among them the cutting-edge correlation map and profile (CMP) technique, to finally draw up an endemic richness map with improved accuracy. The endemic richness showed a sharply increasing southward gradient in the Western Ghats, mainly driven by the seasonality of the temperature and the precipitation's stability. This precise quantification of the tree endemism pattern in peninsular India helped in identifying vulnerable areas in terms of conservation of biodiversity as a whole. The Indian authorities recently used our recommendations to extend protected areas in the southern tip of the Indian peninsula to conserve this endemic richness. We believe that spatial analyses and multiscale comparison tools such as those presented here can help conservationists everywhere to better cope with the difficulties met in identifying zones for protected status. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract = {Climate change has already altered global patterns of biodiversity by modifying the geographic distributions of species. Forecasts based on bioclimatic envelop modeling of distributions of species suggests greater impacts can be expected in the future, but such projections are contingent on assumptions regarding future climate and migration rates of species. Here, we present a first assessment of the potential impact of climate change on a global biodiversity hotspot in southwestern Western Australia. Across three representative scenarios of future climate change, we simulated migration of 100 Banksia (Proteaceae) species at a rate of 5 km decade-1 and compared projected impacts with those under the commonly applied, but acknowledged as inadequate, assumptions of 'full-' and 'no-migration.' Across all climate × migration scenarios, 66{\%} of species were projected to decline, whereas only 6{\%} were projected to expand or remain stable. Between 5{\%} and 25{\%} of species were projected to suffer range losses of 100{\%} by 2080, depending mainly on climate scenario. Species losses were driven primarily by changes in current precipitation regimes, with the greatest losses of species projected to occur in a transition zone between wet coastal areas and interior arid regions and which is projected to become more arid in the future. Because the ranges of most species tended to collapse in all climate scenarios, we found that climate change impacts to flora of southwestern Western Australia may be large, even under optimistic assumptions regarding migration abilities. Taken together, our results suggest that the future of biodiversity in southwestern Western Australia may lie largely in the degree to which this hotspot experiences increased drought and in the ability of species to tolerate such decreases in precipitation. More broadly, our study is among a growing number of theoretical studies suggesting the impacts of future climate change on global biodiversity may be considerable. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

We used vouchered data and MaxEnt models to compile richness estimates (species, genera, and families) across the western coastal region of the US. Nonparametric multiplicative regression then sought the geographic factors or interactions of factors that explained the most variability in lichen richness. Collection density was the strongest predictor of raw estimates of richness at all taxonomic ranks. Latitude was the overall single-best predictor of MaxEnt modeled species, generic, and familial richness in all models. MaxEnt modeling was necessary to minimize collection bias, which otherwise obscured any other patterns of diversity. While geography explained a sizable portion of variance in lichen richness, it does not trend linearly with latitude. Instead, lichen diversity may be influenced by a compilation of regional and local factors including climate, disturbance, and competition. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.},

abstract = {Summary. Earth mounds called ‘murundus' are conspicuous features in the semi-arid region of Brazil, where their distribution and origin remain largely unknown. We adopted an approach based on spatially explicit mapping and modeling to determine the current and potential geographical distribution of murundus. We set up a systematic grid survey to map their current distribution using high-resolution satellite imagery available via free open source software. To obtain insights into the origin of these earth mounds, predictive models were used to test their geographical congruence with six mound-building termites (genera Cornitermes Wasmann, 1897, and Syntermes Holmgren, 1909). The Maxent algorithm was used to generate the potential distribution models based on a set of five variables related to primary environmental regimes that determine the fundamental niche of termite species. To analyze if there was some congruence between associated environmental variables, we cross-checked the results obtained from the statistical tests using MAXENT software. Murundus mostly occur in the south-central region of the Caatinga biome (i.e. seasonally dry tropical forest) in areas with moderate annual mean temperature (20–24°C) and precipitation (600–910 mm), and soils with moderate to severe constraints concerning nutrient availability. We observed a strong geographical congruence between the potential distributions of densely packed murundus and four mound-building termites [i.e. Cornitermes bequaerti Emerson, 1952, C. silvestrii Emerson, 1949, Syntermes dirus (Burmeister, 1839) and S. wheeleri (Emerson, 1925)]. Based on the significant association of those distributions with the climate and soil nutrient availability, we concluded that the formation of murundus in the semi-arid domain might be an adaptive response of mound-building termites to particular regional environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2017 Soci{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} entomologique de France.},

abstract = {Aim Niche conservatism is key to understanding species responses to environmental stress such as climate change or arriving in new geographical space such as biological invasion. Halotydeus destructor is an important agricultural pest in Australia and has been the focus of extensive surveys that suggest this species has undergone a niche shift to expand its invasive range inland to hotter and drier environments. We employ modern correlative modelling methods to examine niche conservatism in H. destructor and highlight ecological differences between historical and current distributions. Location Australia and South Africa. Methods We compile comprehensive distribution data sets for H. destructor, representing the native range in South Africa, its invasive range in Australia in the 1960s (40yr post-introduction) and its current range in Australia. Using MAXENT, we build correlative models and reciprocally project them between South Africa and Australia and investigate range expansion with models constructed for historical and current data sets. We use several recently developed model exploration tools to examine the climate similarity between native and invasive ranges and subsequently examine climatic variables that limit distributions. Results The invasive niche of H. destructor in Australia transgresses the native niche in South Africa, and the species has expanded in Australia beyond what is predicted from the native distribution. Our models support the notion that H. destructor has undergone a more recent range shift into hotter and drier inland areas of Australia since establishing a stable distribution in the 1960s. Main conclusions Our use of historical and current data highlights that invasion is an ongoing dynamic process and demonstrates that once a species has reached an established range, it may still expand at a later stage. We also show that model exploration tools help understand factors influencing the range of invasive species. The models generate hypotheses about adaptive shifts in H. destructor. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim: A wide range of forests distributed across steep environmental gradients are found in Yunnan, southwest China. Climate change could profoundly change these forests by affecting species ranges. We produce predictions about species suitable habitat shifts and use these to (1) evaluate species range size change, loss and turn-over under no- and full-dispersal and nine climate change scenarios and (2) identify environmental variables responsible for current species richness and future local species losses. Location: Yunnan Province, Southwest China. Methods: Using MaxEnt, we modelled current distributions of 2319 woody plant species, corrected for collecting bias and found that 1996 had significant spatial association with environmental factors. Using three General Circulation Models (GCMs: CGCM, CSIRO and HADCM3) for the years 2070-2099 (2080s), based on three emission scenarios for each GCM (A1b, A2a and B2a), we predicted the future geographic position of suitable habitat for each species. Results: Although most species were predicted to persist within Yunnan, with a maximum extinction rate of c. 6{\%} under the most extreme climate change scenario, up to 1400 species (of the 1996 tested) are expected to lose more than 30{\%} of their current range under the most extreme climate change scenario. Assuming no- or unlimited dispersal minimally affected these outcomes. Species losses were associated with increasing temperature variability and declining precipitation during the dry season. Main conclusions: To conserve Yunnan's woody flora, management efforts should focus on providing elevational migration routes at local scales, with priority for those areas located within previously identified conservation hotspots. As almost all species show range contractions, storage of genetic diversity in seed banks and botanical gardens would be sensible. A change in Yunnan's conservation policy will be needed to counter the predicted negative impacts of climate change on its flora. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Coffee is grown in more than 60 tropical countries on over 11 million ha by an estimated 25 million farmers, most of whom are smallholders. Several regional studies demonstrate the climate sensitivity of coffee (Coffea arabica) and the likely impact of climate change on coffee suitability, yield, increased pest and disease pressure and farmers' livelihoods. The objectives of this paper are (i) to quantify the impact of progressive climate change to grow coffee and to produce high quality coffee in Nicaragua and (ii) to develop an adaptation framework across time and space to guide adaptation planning. We used coffee location and cup quality data from Nicaragua in combination with the Maxent and CaNaSTA crop suitability models, the WorldClim historical data and the CMIP3 global circulation models to predict the likely impact of climate change on coffee suitability and quality. We distinguished four different impact scenarios: Very high (coffee disappears), high (large negative changes), medium (little negative changes) and increase (positive changes) in climate suitability. During the Nicaraguan coffee roundtable, most promising adaptation strategies were identified, which we then used to develop a two-dimensional adaptation framework for coffee in time and space. Our analysis indicates that incremental adaptation may occur over short-term horizons at lower altitudes, whereas the same areas may undergo transformative adaptation in the longer term. At higher elevations incremental adaptation may be needed in the long term. The same principle and framework is applicable across coffee growing regions around the world. {\textcopyright} 2016, The Author(s).},

Accepted flagship definitions suggest they need only fulfil a strategic role, unlike umbrella species that are used to shelter cohabitant taxa. The criteria used to select both flagship and umbrella species may not stand up in the face of dramatic forest loss, where remaining fragments may only contain species that do not suit either set of criteria. The Cinderella species concept covers aesthetically pleasing and overlooked species that fulfil the criteria of flagships or umbrellas. Such species are also more likely to occur in fragmented habitats. We tested Cinderella criteria on mammals in the fragmented forests of the Sri Lankan Wet Zone. We selected taxa that fulfilled both strategic and ecological roles. We created a shortlist of ten species, and from a survey of local perceptions highlighted two finalists. We tested these for umbrella characteristics against the original shortlist, utilizing Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modelling, and analysed distribution overlap using ArcGIS. The criteria highlighted Loris tardigradus tardigradus and Prionailurus viverrinus as finalists, with the former having highest flagship potential. We suggest Cinderella species can be effective conservation surrogates especially in habitats where traditional flagship species have been extirpated. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

One of the most evident consequences of this situation is the great disparity in the protection level afforded to the species with different ecological needs, e.g. those linked to woodland vs. those living in open habitats, above all in farmland. The object of this paper is to stress the effectiveness of the Italian protected area network in the protection of bird species breeding in agricultural landscapes. Starting from a national open-habitat breeding bird list, using the data of the MITO 2000 project (Italian breeding birds monitoring project), we have built for each of them a national-scale ecological model, comparing the percentage of suitable habitat occurring inside and outside four different protected-area types (National Parks, Other Protected Areas, Natura 2000 sites and IBAs). Models were built using MaxEnt, a presence-only modelling method. Our results show, with some differences among species, how the national protected areas system fails to guarantee an acceptable level of protection for farmland species, while those breeding in mountain open-habitat have a quite good protection rate.},

abstract = {Invasive species and climate change are considered as the most serious global environmental threats. In this study, we investigated the influence of projected global climate change on the potential distribution of one of the world's most successful invader weed, bushmint (Hyptis suaveolens (L.) Poit.). We used spatial data on 20 environmental variables at a grid resolution of 5 km, and 564 presence records of bushmint from its native and introduced range. The climatic profiles of the native and invaded sites were analyzed in a multi-variate space in order to examine the differences in the position of climatic niches. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model was used to predict the potential distribution of bushmint using presence records from entire range (invaded and native) along with 14 eco-physiologically relevant predictor variables. Subsequently, the trained MaxEnt model was fed with Hadley Centre Coupled Model (HadCM3) climate projections to predict potential distribution of bushmint by the year 2050 under A2a and B2a emission scenarios. MaxEnt predictions were very accurate with an Area Under Curve (AUC) value of 0.95. The results of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicated that climatic niche of bushmint on the invaded sites is not entirely similar to its climatic niche in the native range. A vast area spread between 34 ° 02′ north and 28 ° 18′ south latitudes in tropics was predicted climatically suitable for bushmint. West and middle Africa, tropical southeast Asia, and northern Australia were predicted at high invasion risk. Study indicates enlargement, retreat, or shift across bushmint's invasion range under the influence of climate change. Globally, bushmint's potential distribution might shrink in future with more shrinkage for A2a scenario than B2a. The study outcome has immense potential for undertaking effective preventive/control measures and long-term management strategies for regions/countries, which are at higher risk of bushmint's invasion. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {Maximum entropy (maxent) models have become very popular in natural language processing. This tutorial will begin with a basic introduction of the maximum entropy principle, cover the popular algorithms for training maxent models, and describe how maxent models have been used in language modeling and (more recently) acoustic modeling for speech recognition. Some comparisons with other discriminative modeling methods will be made. A substantial amount of time will be devoted to the details of a new framework for acoustic modeling using maximum entropy direct models, including practical issues of implementation and usage. Traditional statistical models for speech recognition have all been based on a Bayesian framework using generative models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The new framework is based on maximum entropy direct modeling, where the probability of a state or word sequence given an observation sequence is computed directly from the model. In contrast to HMMs, features can be asynchronous and overlapping, and need not be statistically independent. This model therefore allows for the potential combination of many different types of features. Results from a specific kind of direct model, the maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM), will be presented. Even with conventional acoustic features, the approach already shows promising results for phone level decoding. The MEMM significantly outperforms traditional HMMs in word error rate when used as stand-alone acoustic models. Combining the MEMM scores with HMM and language model scores show modest improvements over the best HMM speech recognizer. This tutorial will give a sense of some exciting possibilities for future research in using maximum entropy models for acoustic modeling. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

In this paper, a phylogeographic history of T. arvense including 19 populations from China was inferred by using three chloroplast (cp) DNA segments (trnL-trnF, rpl32-trnL and rps16) and one nuclear (n) DNA segment (Fe-regulated transporter-like protein, ZIP). A total of 11 chloroplast haplotypes and six nuclear alleles were identified, and haplotypes unique to the QTP were recognized (C4, C5, C7 and N4). On the basis of molecular dating, haplotypes C4, C5 and C7 have separated from others around 1.58 Ma for cpDNA, which corresponds to the QTP uplift. In addition, this article suggests that the T. arvense populations in China are a mixture of diverged subpopulations as inferred by hT/vT test (hT ≤ vT, cpDNA) and positive Tajima's D values (1.87, 0.05 {\textless} p {\textless} 0.10 for cpDNA and 3.37, p {\textless} 0.01 for nDNA).

abstract = {A wide range of modelling algorithms is used by ecologists, conservation practitioners, and others to predict species ranges from point locality data. Unfortunately, the amount of data available is limited for many taxa and regions, making it essential to quantify the sensitivity of these algorithms to sample size. This is the first study to address this need by rigorously evaluating a broad suite of algorithms with independent presence-absence data from multiple species and regions. We evaluated predictions from 12 algorithms for 46 species (from six different regions of the world) at three sample sizes (100, 30, and 10 records). We used data from natural history collections to run the models, and evaluated the quality of model predictions with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). With decreasing sample size, model accuracy decreased and variability increased across species and between models. Novel modelling methods that incorporate both interactions between predictor variables and complex response shapes (i.e. GBM, MARS-INT, BRUTO) performed better than most methods at large sample sizes but not at the smallest sample sizes. Other algorithms were much less sensitive to sample size, including an algorithm based on maximum entropy (MAXENT) that had among the best predictive power across all sample sizes. Relative to other algorithms, a distance metric algorithm (DOMAIN) and a genetic algorithm (OM-GARP) had intermediate performance at the largest sample size and among the best performance at the lowest sample size. No algorithm predicted consistently well with small sample size (n {\textless} 30) and this should encourage highly conservative use of predictions based on small sample size and restrict their use to exploratory modelling. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Despite being one of the most charismatic elements of the Mediterranean Basin fauna and its threatened status, the western Mediterranean range of Testudo graeca is at present very poorly known. The present work provides the most detailed geographical and ecological description for the North African clade of T. graeca so far. We gathered 283 occurrence data of T. graeca in North Africa and modelled the distribution by means of presence-only distribution modelling tools. The obtained model was then projected to southern Europe in order to explore whether the environmental characteristics of European populations fall into the predicted niche of the species in North Africa. T. graeca showed a wide environmental range in North Africa. Presence localities ranged from the sea level to 2090 m of altitude and from 116 to 1093 mm of annual precipitation. The presence-only model indicates that distribution in North Africa is mainly related to rainfall, specifically rainfall values in the wettest and coldest quarter of the year. The distribution model showed a range of ca. 1∈000∈000 km2. The projection of the model to southern Europe showed that the southern Iberian and Balkan Peninsulas, as well as most Mediterranean islands, present climatic conditions within those found in the range of the species in North Africa. {\textcopyright} Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2012.},

We founded that MaxEnt model has provided different descriptions of potential distributions based on different sample size, sample accuracy and environmental background. We used six combinations based on three sample data set and two kinds of environmental variables to estimate the potentially suitable areas of Brown Eared Pheasant (Crossoptilon mantchuricum) in MaxEnt model. The results show that the complex variables provided the higher AUC value and accurate potential distribution than simple variables based on the same size of samples. Complicated environmental factors combined with moderate size and accurate sample, can predict better results. The model results were scabrous based on simple environmental factors. Furthermore, big sample size and simple prediction environmental factors will reduce the prediction accuracy, whereas small samples provided a conservative description of ecological niche.

abstract = {The bivalve Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857), also called golden mussel, is native to Asia but becoming dispersed around the world. The golden mussel resembles the invasive dreissenid bivalves in many respects, and although much less studied it evidently has broader environmental tolerances. The golden mussel was introduced into the La Plata River estuary (South America) and quickly expanded upstream to the north, into the tropical Paraguay River reaching a large floodplain area in Brazil known as the Pantanal wetland. The golden mussel tolerates environmental conditions in the Pantanal that would be inhospitable for most bivalves, but mussel mortality has been observed during the most extreme oxygen depletion events. Based on knowledge about the limiting factors for the golden mussel in the Pantanal wetland, its potential distribution was predicted for the remainder of the Paraguay River basin where the species is not present, as well as in other river systems throughout Brazil. Forecasts of potential distribution in Brazilian river systems were based on physicochemical limitations for shell calcification, and specifically on lower thresholds of dissolved calcium concentrations and the calcium carbonate (calcite) index of saturation, which may be a better indicator of calcification potential in low-calcium waters than calcium concentration alone. In addition to examining spatial patterns in calcium and calcification potential, these and other limnological and climate variables were used in ecological niche modeling using GARP and Maxent algorithms. Forecasts of potential distributions in three major North American river systems (Mississippi, Colorado, and Rio Grande) were based mainly on water temperature because calcium availability and calcification evidently would not be limiting to golden mussel establishment in those waters. Due to the greater tolerance of the golden mussel to conditions known to limit other bivalves, as well as its greater ability for shell calcification in low-calcium water, the golden mussel could potentially become broadly distributed throughout Brazil. According to its thermal tolerance L. fortunei could become established in the Mississippi, Colorado and Rio Grande drainage systems, although the northern Mississippi River system including the Missouri River may be too cool in the winter to support the golden mussel. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

This paper describes how distribution models are used to develop benthic distribution maps with biological data collected from surveys, and environmental variables derived from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), including different indices of terrain complexity. We compared the success of two algorithms, Maxent and ENFA, commonly used in the marine environment to identify best suited methods to modelling the distributions of six benthic communities identified in the marine protected area of La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain). The environmental variables depth, slope, type of substrate, Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) and Vector Ruggedness Measure (VRM) were the variables with higher influence on the distribution of communities. The distribution models of both techniques were coincident and congruent, although Maxent produced more constrained predictions than ENFA, highlighting the significantly better performance of the Maxent models for communities with fewer presences, in this study, black coral and brown garden eels. The resulting distribution maps were evaluated and reclassified and they were represented in a unique map that summarises all of the individual maps. Given that the distribution models were made on the same study area and based on presences data collected at the same time, it was possible to make a preliminary analyse of the interactions between the studied communities. In conclusion, distribution models of benthic communities are suitable tools to design reliable and full coverage distribution maps of benthic communities and they provide new information about the behaviour of communities on the range of environmental conditions studied and useful information for management of marine and coastal areas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Climate change has the potential to severely threaten Taxuschinensis, an endangered endemic tree plant in China. Hence, we need to plan conservation areas for T. chinensis in light of climate change. We applied the common species distribution modelling software Maxent to generate maps of current and projected future distributions of T. chinensis. These distributional maps with conservation planning software were used to determine priority protection areas (PPAs). Then, we evaluated the ability of existing nature reserves to conserve T. chinensis and performed a gap analysis for the species under climate change. The PPAs of T. chinensis were mainly distributed within central and southern China. Nature reserves such as Zhangjiajiedani, Yangzie, Wolong, Baishuijiang and Dabashan have the greatest potential to protect T. chinensis under climate change. In situ and ex situ conservation of T. chinensis in the PPAs of these five nature reserves should be a priority. However, existing nature reserves lag far behind the PPAs with respect to total area. Therefore, more nature reserves are urgently needed for species like T. chinensis to cope with rapid climate change. Meanwhile, we should strengthen protection and management of areas that will experience an increase in T. chinensis while enhancing both monitoring and protection activities for T. chinensis in PPAs that are predicted to experience decreases in population size. Finally, we suggest that climate change must be integrated into conservation planning for the endangered plant species, T. chinensis. {\textcopyright} 2017, Pakistan Agricultural Scientists Forum.

Endangered species are likely to be a special concern, but the extent to which they are sensitive to climate is currently unclear. Species distribution modelling, if carefully implemented, can be used to assess climate sensitivity and potential climate change impacts, of tree species. We used MaxEnt algorithm for species distribution modelling to assess the potential distribution and climate change risks for a threatened Prunus africana, in East Africa. Data from different herbaria on its distribution were linked to data on climate to test hypotheses on the factors determining its distribution. Predictive models were developed and projected onto a climate scenario for 2050 to assess climate change risks. Precipitation of driest quarter and annual precipitation appeared to be the main factors influencing its distribution. Climate change was predicted to result in reductions of the species' habitats (e.g. Erasmus et al., Glob. Change Biol. 2002; 8: 679). Prunus africana distribution is thus highly vulnerable to a warming climate and highlights the fact that both in-situ and ex-situ conservation will be a solution to global warming. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Therefore, the ability to predict regions potentially suitable for alien species, which are hence at high risk, has become a core task for successful management. The Common Waxbill Estrilda astrild is a widespread African species, which has been successfully introduced to many parts of the world. Herein, we used MAXENT software, a machine-learning algorithm, to assess its current potential distribution based on species records compiled from various sources. Models were trained separately with records from the species' native range and from both invaded and native ranges. Subsequently, the models were projected onto different future climate change scenarios. They successfully identified the species known range as well as some regions that seem climatically well suited, where the Common Waxbill is not yet recorded. Assuming future conditions, the models suggest poleward range shifts. However, its potential distribution pattern within its tropical native and invasive ranges appears to be more complex. Although the results of both separate analyses showed general similarities, many differences have become obvious. Niche overlap analysis shows that the invasive range includes only a small fraction of the ecological space that can be found in the native range. Thus, we tentatively prefer the model based on native locations only, but in particular, we highlight the importance of the selection process of species records for modelling invasive species. {\textcopyright} 2011 Dt.

The aforementioned methods have been tested on a data set from the northern North Sea. The results showed that return levels associated to high return periods obtained with MaxEnt are very stable through the whole threshold range, implying that MaxEnt is more robust to the variation of threshold, i.e. sample size than the GPD, leading to the conclusion that MaxEnt is the more suitable model than the GPD model, for this particular data set. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Ecological niche modelling is used to analyze the present and potential future distribution of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) in two biogeographically distinct regions of India i.e., the Western Ghats (WG) and Northeast (NE). The rubber tree is an economically important plantation species, and therefore factors other than climate may play a significant role in determining its occurrence. To assist in future planning, we used the maximum entropy model to predict plausible areas for the expansion of rubber tree plantations under a changing climate scenario. Inclusion of elevation, soil and socioeconomic factors into the model did not result in a significant increase in the model accuracy estimates over the bioclimatic model (AUC {\textgreater} 0.92), but their effect was pronounced in the predicted probability scoring of species occurrence. Among various factors, elevation, rooting condition, village population and agricultural labour availability contributed substantially to the model in the NE region, whereas for the WG region, climate was the most important contributing factor for rubber tree distribution. We found that more areas would be suitable for rubber tree plantation in the NE region, whereas further expansion would be limited in the WG region under the projected climate scenario for 2050. {\textcopyright} 2015, The Ecological Society of Japan.},

abstract = {Spatial transfers of species distribution models (SDMs) are often applied in the study of land use and climate-change effects, spread of invasive species and conservation planning. However, model transferability and risk of error are rarely evaluated prior to predicting species distribution to different regions. We aim to assess spatial transferability of SDMs for stream fish and to evaluate the effect of model types and habitat heterogeneity on transferability. We developed SDMs for 21 fish species and made predictions of occurrence of these species among five pairs of river catchments (i.e. model transfers). Forty eight transfers were made for each of three modelling approaches (Lasso-regularised logistic regression (LLR), boosted regression trees (BRT) and MaxEnt) after incorporating spatial autocorrelation. In addition to internal and external evaluation of discrimination power, we assessed the cross-catchment consistency of variable selections, fish-habitat relationships and predicted probabilities of species presences. Approximately half of 144 spatial transfers of SDMs had moderate to high discrimination power. Discrimination power was low for the rest of the models. Incorporating spatial autocorrelation could not improve discrimination power in the model transfers. Friedman test showed that BRT did not differ significantly from LLR but it outperformed MaxEnt in terms of AUC in the model transfers. BRT and LLR models tended to have high overall accuracy and specificity, whereas MaxEnt tended to have high sensitivity in the model transfers. The degree of model transferability varied among species, and was asymmetric when reciprocal transfers were made between paired catchments. Ranks of variable importance in BRT models differed among catchments for most species. Temperature, base flow index, altitude and habitat condition index were more often ranked as the most important predictors in the five study river catchments, although the functional forms of their effects on fish presence were sometimes inconsistent between paired catchments. Compared to published transferability of some terrestrial taxa SDMs, spatial transferability of stream-fish distribution models was limited, reflecting the natural barriers to dispersal among catchments, and the necessity of evaluating model transferability in conservation applications (e.g. evaluation of climate- or landscape-change effects, invasive species risk assessments and species reintroduction planning). We suggest the following strategies to enhance spatial transferability: (i) match the range and location of the habitat predictors between the model region and prediction region, or alternatively choose a model training region with a large extent and a wide range of environmental gradients; (ii) use presence-absence models such as BRT and LLR and (iii) include habitat features with a sound ecological basis such as temperature and hydrology. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

Shifting fire regimes have been documented around the world, and fire frequency and extent is predicted to increase in many areas because of changes in both climate and land management. Here, we evaluate how predicted increases in fire frequency are likely to impact on species distributions. Location The tropical savannas of northern Australia. Methods We developed distribution models for 44 bird species using the modelling algorithm Maxent. Our models incorporated bird locality records and environmental variables including climate, total fire frequency and the subset of fire frequency occurring late in the dry season. We investigated the effect of increasing total fire frequency and increasing fire late in the dry season, on species distributions by projecting species model algorithms onto scenarios of incrementally increased total fire frequency. Results The probability of presence for most species was higher when fire frequency late in the dry season was low. Species showed a mixed response to an overall increase in total fire frequency, with one-third predicted to increase in distribution. However, almost all species (98{\%}) showed a decrease in predicted range with increased late-dry season fire, and species distribution area was generally negatively correlated with an increase in late-dry season fire. Main conclusions Our study highlighted the array of responses of species to increasing fire frequency and suggested that increased fire frequency late in the dry season is detrimental to most savanna-restricted bird species. The understanding of individual species' preferences for particular fire frequencies is important for informed conservation planning. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In the introduced range, raccoons may impact on breeding birds and amphibians, exert crop damages and transmit pathologies to wild species and humans. The species has been introduced also in Italy, where the only known reproductive population is observed since 2004 in Lombardy, along the Adda river. We reconstructed the current distribution range of the Northern raccoon in Italy, collecting information from scientific papers, articles in newspapers and books, as well from experts and local reporters. A total of 53 occurrence points were collected from observation sites. Since 2008, records from Lombardy increased, and sporadic observations were reported from seven other regions. A complete lack of records from the Northernmost provinces of Lombardy (Varese, Como and Sondrio) suggests that the only Italian population does not derive from a range expansion from Switzerland, but it should be considered as an independent, new introduction. Accidental observations of single individuals possibly escaped from captivity are often ignored, and only few animals were removed from the wild. An analysis of the potential distribution of the species was performed in a species distribution modeling framework (MaxEnt). A global model was built up considering the occurrences of reproductive populations from the native range and introduced areas in Europe and Japan and then projected to Italy. The model suggested a good suitability for the plains in Central-Northern Italy and a very low suitability of the Alpine region, thus providing support to the hypothesis that the Italian population did not derive from dispersal from Switzerland. If escapes or releases of raccoons will continue, there is a risk that the species could colonize other areas, making its containment more difficult. {\textcopyright} 2015, Associazione Teriologica Italiana.},

abstract = {Ecological niche models can be a useful tool to identify candidate reintroduction sites for endangered species but have been infrequently used for this purpose. In this paper, we (1) develop activity-specific ecological niche models (nesting, roosting, and feeding) for the critically endangered California condor ( Gymnogyps californianus) to aid in reintroduction planning in California, Oregon, and Washington, USA, (2) test the accuracy of these models using empirical data withheld from model development, and (3) integrate model results with information on condor movement ecology and biology to produce predictive maps of reintroduction site suitability. Our approach, which disentangles niche models into activity-specific components, has applications for other species where it is routinely assumed (often incorrectly) that individuals fulfill all requirements for life within a single environmental space. Ecological niche models conformed to our understanding of California condor ecology, had good predictive performance when tested with data withheld from model development, and aided in the identification of several candidate reintroduction areas outside of the current distribution of the species. Our results suggest there are large unoccupied regions of the California condor's historical range that have retained ecological features similar to currently occupied habitats, and thus could be considered for future reintroduction efforts. Combining our activity-specific ENMs with ground reconnaissance and information on other threat factors that could not be directly incorporated into empirical ENMs will ultimately improve our ability to select successful reintroduction sites for the California condor. {\textcopyright} 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper we analyzed environmental differentiation of closely related species from the Merodon ruficornis group. By applying principal component analysis (PCA) and environmental niche modelling (ENM)-based techniques, we estimated the level of niche divergence of closely related species. Our results indicate that ecology has an important role in the diversification process in related species from the M. ruficornis group. Distribution patterns of all analyzed species are mainly affected by the limiting effects of the temperature of the coldest quarter and month, as well as by the precipitation of the wettest and driest quarters. Our results demonstrated that among all related species, with the exception of M. ovaloides, overall or partial divergence in environmental space is present. Importantly, the results indicate that the environmental niches of all endemic species are restricted to smaller parts of the environmental space. In the case of niche overlap, the niches of endemic species are placed along the border of the realized niche of the widespread related species. For species in which distribution is not limited by geographical barriers, environmental preferences could be considered as limiting factors for further expansion, as in the case of M. alexandri, a lowland species with very strict climatic adaptations. Knowledge about the environmental factors that might influence the diversification process can provide an explanation for the high diversity in other Merodon species groups. {\textcopyright} 2017 by the Serbian Biological Society.},

abstract = {Aim The funnelweb spider Macrothele calpeiana is endemic to the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula, but recent occurrence records from localities in Spain, North Africa and other regions of Europe, which are distant from its native populations, suggest human-mediated dispersal, probably associated with the commercial export of olive trees. The main goal of this study was to assess the environmental suitability of these new records and to discuss the spider's potential to become an invasive species, mainly in new regions across Central Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. Location Central Europe, Mediterranean Basin. Methods Using presence points from the Iberian native populations of M. calpeiana and a set of climatic variables, four presence-only algorithms (BIOCLIM, DOMAIN, GARP and Maxent) were applied to model the potential distribution of the spider. The models were transferred to Central Europe and the Mediterranean Basin, and the locations of the new records in both the occupied and potential environmental spaces were screened. Results The four models were generally congruent in predicting the existence of a suitable climate for the species across the Mediterranean Basin, although BIOCLIM and DOMAIN yielded more constrained predictions than GARP and Maxent. Whereas the new records from Central Europe were located far from the occupied and potential climatic spaces, those from the Iberian Peninsula were not. Main conclusions Climatic suitability together with propagule pressure owing to human activities will certainly enhance the opportunities for M. calpeiana to colonize new areas across the Mediterranean Basin. The species has invaded areas beyond its native range, and those new locations located in the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa show environmental suitability for the spider and deserve long-term monitoring. Although the new locations in Central Europe were not predicted by the climate models and the persistence of the species seems improbable, the possibility of rapid evolution or phenotypic plasticity processes raises the need for caution over the possibility of a future spread of M. calpeiana across Europe. Stronger controls over the transport of trees must be applied, and further studies on the ecology of the spider are imperative to assess the possible impact on the invaded ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The interaction of various elements of socioeconomic, political and cultural nature, influenced by landscape and climatic factors, are important aspects of fire regimes. Space models that integrate these elements and factors help to more accurately predict potential fire areas. The Protected Area Wildlife La Primavera (APFFLP) is the main regulator of the climate of the Guadalajara metropolitan area, and forest fires frequently occur there. These represent a challenge for science and technology to develop methodologies that help predict forest fires. This study involves the construction of a spatial model that helps identify potential areas of fire in that area. The model integrates meteorological variables, landscape, fuels, anthropogenic and/or causality, and historical occurrences of fires during the period 1998-2012. According to the model, the variables that determine the areas of greatest fire potential are: slope (landscape), relative humidity (weather), vegetation type (causality) and land use (anthropogenic). The model predicts a large area with high potential for fire, located in the central and northwest APFFLP polygon; also, there are small, isolated potential zones in the eastern part of the polygon. The information developed by this study could support the generation of local risk maps, thereby optimizing the actions of fire management and restoration of the La Primavera forest. {\textcopyright} 2016, Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi).

abstract = {When performing habitat models, modellers have to choose between presence-absence and presence-only models to estimate the habitat preferences of a species. Primarily, this choice depends on the data that are available and whether effort data are recorded in parallel to sighting data. For species that are rare or scarce, the models have to address a great number of zeros (i.e., no animal seen) that weakens the ability to make sound ecological inferences. We tested two types of habitat models (presence-absence vs. presence-only) to determine which type best dealt with datasets containing an excess of zeros, and we applied our models to a sighting dataset that included the common (Delphinus delphis) and striped (Stenella coeruleoalba) dolphin (approximately 92{\%} zeros). We used two types of presence-absence models (Generalised Additive models – GAMs, Generalised Linear Model – GLM) and one presence-only model, a MaxEnt model, and we used various criteria to compare these models (i.e., AIC, deviances, rootograms and distribution patterns predicted by the models). Overall, we observed that the presence-absence models made better predictions than the presence-only model. Among the presence-absence models, the GAM with a Negative Binomial distribution was better at predicting small delphinids habitats, even though the GAM with a Tweedie distribution exhibited similar results. However, the zero-inflated Poisson distributions exhibited less convincing results and was contrary to what was expected. Finally, despite 92{\%} zeros, our dataset was not zero-inflated. Our study demonstrates the importance of selecting appropriate models to make reliable predictions of habitat use for species that are rare or scarce. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aim: Ecological differentiation of closely related species has attracted wide attention to explore its evolutionary significance in speciation. In particular, the prevalence of ecological speciation of sister species driven by Quaternary climate changes is debated. Here, we used two parapatric sister species, Roscoea humeana and R. cautleoides, to test whether ecological speciation was associated with Quaternary climate changes in these taxa. Location: Hengduan-Mountain Region (HMR), south-west of China. Methods: Nuclear ribosomal (ITS) and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA: psbA–trnH and trnL–trnF) were sequenced from 200 individuals. Gene genealogies were reconstructed using network, Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods. Interspecific divergence times were estimated with an isolation with migration model. Suitable habitats for each species were estimated with ecological niche modelling using Maxent and BIOCLIM. Niche overlap and niche divergence were tested using Schoener's D and Warren's I. Principal components analysis (PCA), multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and discriminant function analysis (DFA) were also used to test ecological differentiation. Results: Gene genealogies indicated that the low-elevational species R. cautleoides was derived from the high-elevational species R. humeana. Divergence among species occurred during the middle to late Quaternary (0.01–1.48 Ma). The species distribution and phylogeographical pattern were inconsistent with a geographical barrier. Niche models and statistical analyses showed significant ecological differentiation. Main conclusions: Divergence between R. humeana and R. cautleoides was recent and coincident with Quaternary climate cycles. Ecological niche differentiation within Quaternary refugia may have promoted speciation. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Aim Studies of environmental niche shift/niche conservatism that are based on species distribution modelling require a quantification of niche purity and potential overlap. Although various metrics have been proposed for this task, no comparisons of their performance are available yet that express the linearity of range shifts and error-proneness. Herein, we assess the performance of six niche overlap metrics using three sister pairs of plethodontid salamanders as well as artificial species to test for linearity of overlap curves, impacts of varying potential distribution sizes and study area sizes. Location North America, artificial environments. Methods Species distribution models for the salamanders were performed with Maxent, and artificial species were created in the R environment. Potential distributions of species with varying range sizes and extents of the study area were compared using the Bray-Curtis distance BC, Schoener's D, two different modifications of the Hellinger distance Imod, Icor, Pianka's O and Horn's R. Niche overlaps in ecological space were compared using linear discriminant analyses based on principal components. Results Simulations of niche overlaps revealed strong variations in the performance of the niche overlap metrics. In artificial species, BC and D performed best, followed by O, R and Icor, but the modified Hellinger distance Imod showed a nonlinear slope and a truncated range. Furthermore, the simulations suggest that, in proportionally small potential distributions on large grids, an inclusion of a high proportion of grid cells with low occurrence probabilities representing background noise may bias assessments of niche overlaps. Main conclusions Both the salamander examples and simulations suggest that Schoener's D and the Bray-Curtis distance BC are best suited to compute niche overlaps from potential distributions derived from species distribution models. However, like all analysed metrics, both D and BC are seriously affected by the inclusion of high numbers of grid cells where the species are probably absent, i.e. with low occurrence probabilities. Therefore, pre-processing to eliminate background noise in the potential distribution grids is highly recommended. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim: We examined three potential enhancements of the stable isotope technique for elucidating migratory connectivity in birds inhabiting poorly studied areas, illustrated for Eurasian cranes (Grus grus) that overwinter in and migrate through Israel. First, we examined the use of oxygen stable isotopes ($\delta$18O), seldom applied for this purpose. Second, we examined the relationship between ambient water $\delta$18O and hydrogen stable isotope ($\delta$2H) values derived from various models, to determine the geographical origins of migrants. Third, we introduced the use of probabilistic distribution modelling to refine the assignment to origin of migrants lacking detailed distribution maps. Location: Feather samples were collected in the Hula Valley (northern Israel) and across the species breeding range in north Eurasia. Methods: We analysed $\delta$18O and $\delta$2H in primary and secondary flight feathers using standard mass spectrometry. The maximum entropy (maxent) model was used to map the probability surface of potential breeding areas, as a Bayesian prior for assigning Hula Valley cranes to potential breeding grounds. Results: We found that $\delta$18O was suitable and informative. The soil water isoscape performed better for $\delta$18O while precipitation isoscape was preferable for $\delta$2H. The maxent-based probability surface largely refined assignments. Overall, most ({\textgreater}85{\%}) cranes were assigned to the area west of the Ural Mountains, but for two individuals, most of the assigned area ({\textgreater}90{\%}) was farther east, suggesting, for the first time, that Eurasian cranes may undertake the North Asia-Middle East (and perhaps Africa) migration flyway. Main conclusions: Our results call for broader use of $\delta$18O in migratory connectivity studies and for application of probabilistic distribution modelling. We also encourage investigation of factors determining $\delta$18O and $\delta$2H integration into animal tissues. The proposed framework may help improve our understanding of migratory connectivity of species inhabiting previously unexplored areas and thus contribute to the development of efficient conservation plans. {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {The wool carder bee, Anthidium manicatum, is the most widely distributed unmanaged bee in the world. It was unintentionally introduced to North America in the late 1960s from Europe, and subsequently, into South America, New Zealand and the Canary Islands. We provide information on the local distribution, seasonal abundance and sex ratio of A. manicatum from samples collected in an intensive two-year survey across Utah, USA. Anthidium manicatum was detected in 10 of the 29 Utah counties, largely in urban and suburban settings. Combining presence-only and MaxEnt background data from literature, museum databases and new records from Utah, we constructed three species distribution models to examine the potential distribution of A. manicatum in its native Eurasian range as well as invaded ranges of North and South America. The A. manicatum model based on locality and background data from the species' native range predicted 50{\%} of the invasive records associated with high habitat suitability (HS ≥ 0.90). The invasive North American model predicted a much broader distribution of A. manicatum (214{\%} increase); whereas, the South American model predicted a narrower distribution (88{\%} decrease). The poor predictive power of the latter model in estimating suitable habitats in the invasive South American range of A. manicatum suggests that the bee may still be limited by the bioclimatic constraints associated with a novel environment. Estimates of niche similarity (D) between the native and invasive models find that the North America bioclimatic niche is more similar to the bioclimatic niche of the native model (D=0.78), whereas the bioclimatic niche of the South America invasion is relatively dissimilar (D=0.69). We discuss the naturalization of A. manicatum in North America, possibly through punctuated dispersal, the probability of suitable habitats across the globe and the synanthropy exhibited by this invasive species. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

abstract = {We assessed the ability of climatic, environmental, and anthropogenic variables to predict areas of high-risk for plant invasion and consider the relative importance and contribution of these predictor variables by considering two spatial scales in a region of rapidly changing climate. We created predictive distribution models, using Maxent, for three highly invasive plant species (Canada thistle, white sweetclover, and reed canarygrass) in Alaska at both a regional scale and a local scale. Regional scale models encompassed southern coastal Alaska and were developed from topographic and climatic data at a 2 km (1.2 mi) spatial resolution. Models were applied to future climate (2030). Local scale models were spatially nested within the regional area; these models incorporated physiographic and anthropogenic variables at a 30 m (98.4 ft) resolution. Regional and local models performed well (AUC values {\textgreater} 0.7), with the exception of one species at each spatial scale. Regional models predict an increase in area of suitable habitat for all species by 2030 with a general shift to higher elevation areas; however, the distribution of each species was driven by different climate and topographical variables. In contrast local models indicate that distance to right-of-ways and elevation are associated with habitat suitability for all three species at this spatial level. Combining results from regional models, capturing long-term distribution, and local models, capturing near-term establishment and distribution, offers a new and effective tool for highlighting at-risk areas and provides insight on how variables acting at different scales contribute to suitability predictions. The combinations also provides easy comparison, highlighting agreement between the two scales, where long-term distribution factors predict suitability while near-term do not and vice versa. Nomenclature: Canada thistle, Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop., reed canarygrass, Phalaris arundinacea L, white sweetclover, Melilotus albus Medik. Management Implications: Effective and proactive management of invasive species requires information on both current and potential future distributions. Alaska, similar to other high latitude areas, is relatively invasion free (Lassuy and Lewis, 2013). The rapidly changing climate in this region, however, is expected to increase the area suitable for establishment for a larger number of invasive species. Here, we present results for habitat suitability models of highly invasive plants in the southern coastal region of Alaska, creating climate driven models at a regional scale and physiographic and anthropogenic models for two local regions. Using these types of models for targeted sampling of invasive plants detected more locations with less effort than nontargeted sampling (Crall et al., 2013). Our local scale models can be thought of as predicting near term establishment and distribution (potential early detection locations for management), while longer term trends in distribution may be driven by climate, especially related to the future climate scenarios at the coastal scale (potential distributions). Locations where models at both scales indicate high habitat suitability values are more appropriate targets for current control and monitoring efforts than locations identified by a model that considers factors operating at a single scale. Additionally, evaluating the areas of future suitable habitat among early invaders can help prioritize which species should be targeted for control first. If two species have similar initial distributions and similar ecological impacts, management efforts should be directed to the species with the largest possible future distribution. These models, when incorporated into an iterative sampling approach, can guide future sampling efforts. The new sampling is then used to generate future model iterations, which then provide evolving distribution models that help prioritize locations for control and restoration efforts {\textcopyright} Weed Science Society of America.},

This study was undertaken to identify areas containing wetland habitats to support actions aimed at the conservation of wetland bird species on the Red Sea coast of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). We used a maximum entropy approach to build habitat suitability models for 22 wetland bird species (gulls, shorebirds, and terns). Ten variables relating to topography, habitat, latitude, coast complexity, man-made structures, and human settlements were used to produce individual habitat suitability models for each of the bird species. The areas under the curve (AUC) for the final model were 0.9013 and 0.879 for the training and testing data, respectively, and the jackknife analyses suggested that the models generally performed well. Using the modelled distributions of the 22 species along the Red Sea coast, the analysis suggested 17 core areas where the habitat and landscape configuration were suitable for supporting high species richness. Of these 17 sites, one is already protected, and there is a need to protect the remaining sites.

abstract = {Background: South Africa's long and extensive trade activity has ensured ample opportunities for exotic species introduction. Whereas the rich biodiversity of endemic southern African fauna has been the focus of many studies, invasive vertebrates are generally overlooked despite potential impacts on biodiversity, health and agriculture. Genetic monitoring of commensal rodents in South Africa which uncovered the presence of Rattus tanezumi, a South-East Asian endemic not previously known to occur in Africa, provided the impetus for expanded studies on all invasive Rattus species present.Results: To this end, intensified sampling at 28 South African localities and at one site in Swaziland, identified 149 Rattus specimens. Cytochrome b gene sequencing revealed the presence of two R. tanezumi, seven Rattus rattus and five Rattus norvegicus haplotypes in south Africa. Phylogenetic results were consistent with a single, recent R. tanezumi introduction and indicated that R. norvegicus and R. rattus probably became established following at least two and three independent introductions, respectively. Intra- and inter-specific diversity was highest in informal human settlements, with all three species occurring at a single metropolitan township site. Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus each occurred sympatrically with Rattus tanezumi at one and five sites, respectively. Karyotyping of selected R. rattus and R. tanezumi individuals identified diploid numbers consistent with those reported previously for these cryptic species. Ordination of bioclimatic variables and MaxEnt ecological niche modelling confirmed that the bioclimatic niche occupied by R. tanezumi in south Africa was distinct from that occupied in its naturalised range in south-east Asia suggesting that factors other than climate may influence the distribution of this species.Conclusions: This study has highlighted the value of genetic typing for detecting cryptic invasive species, providing historical insights into introductions and for directing future sampling. The apparent ease with which a cryptic species can become established signals the need for broader implementation of genetic monitoring programmes. In addition to providing baseline data and potentially identifying high-risk introduction routes, the predictive power of ecological niche modelling is enhanced when species records are genetically verified. {\textcopyright} 2011 Bastos et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Since its introduction in the 1950s, tall fescue has spread throughout the Pampas region of Argentina to become naturalized in much of this region. Its annual forage mass productivity shows significant differences among sites. In this work, we hypothesized that, under dryland conditions, the annual forage mass productivity is related to the probability that the corresponding site is within the ecological niche of the species. To test this hypothesis, the spontaneous occurrence of tall fescue was surveyed in an area of 440 000 km2. The abundance of tall fescue was verified on roadsides of national and provincial roads, in systematic sampling points spaced every 50 km. Subsequently, the ecological niche of the species was estimated with the Maxent software, based on the environmental information available. Additionally, the bioclimatic variables with greatest influence in determining the ecological niche were identified. Based on the information of comparative yield trials of tall fescue cultivars, a correlation analysis between annual forage mass productivity and the likelihood of ecological niche was performed. We found that the realized ecological niche of tall fescue in the Pampas region covers an area of 237 000 km2 where the average minimum temperature of the coldest month is between 2{\textperiodcentered}6 and 3{\textperiodcentered}2°C and the rainfall in the driest quarter is 100 mm or higher. We also found that there were significant correlations between annual forage mass productivity and the probability of realized ecological niche. Therefore, in areas with low probability of realized ecological niche, other forage species could be a better option than tall fescue to obtain a high and stable annual forage mass productivity. {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Wildfire ignition distribution models are powerful tools for predicting the probability of ignitions across broad areas, and identifying their drivers. Several approaches have been used for ignition-distribution modelling, yet the performance of different model types has not been compared. This is unfortunate, given that conceptually similar species-distribution models exhibit pronounced differences among model types. Therefore, our goal was to compare the predictive performance, variable importance and the spatial patterns of predicted ignition-probabilities of three ignition-distribution model types: one parametric, statistical model (Generalised Linear Models, GLM) and two machine-learning algorithms (Random Forests and Maximum Entropy, Maxent). We parameterised the models using 16 years of ignitions data and environmental data for the Huron-Manistee National Forest in Michigan, USA. Random Forests and Maxent had slightly better prediction accuracies than did GLM, but model fit was similar for all three. Variables related to human population and development were the best predictors of wildfire ignition locations in all models (although variable rankings differed slightly), along with elevation. However, despite similar model performance and variables, the map of ignition probabilities generated by Maxent was markedly different from those of the two other models. We thus suggest that when accurate predictions are desired, the outcomes of different model types should be compared, or alternatively combined, to produce ensemble predictions. {\textcopyright} IAWF 2013.},

Assessing species' vulnerability to climate change is important for organizations responsible for managing natural areas and conserving rare species. We assessed the climate change vulnerability of 34 rare plant taxa from the western United States using two methods: NatureServe's Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) and one based on Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) using Maxent. Of the eight taxa categorized as Extremely Vulnerable by the CCVI, five show significant future loss in each of three SDM measures: change in suitable area, suitable area overlap, and habitat suitability in their present location. Both the CCVI and SDM are important tools to assess climate change vulnerability; each method has complementary strengths that can help land managers make decisions. Here we present examples of how land managers can use SDM and the CCVI in combination to assess climate change vulnerability, to inform rare plant management decisions, and to conserve biological diversity.},

abstract = {The warmer and drier climates projected for the mid- to late-21st century may have particularly adverse impacts on the cool temperate rainforests of southeastern Australia. Southern beech (Nothofagus cunninghamii; Nothofagaceae), a dominant tree species in these forests, may be vulnerable to minor changes in its climate envelope, especially at the edge of the species range, with Holocene fossil evidence showing local extinction of populations in response to small climate changes. We modelled the stability of this species climate envelope using the maximum entropy algorithm implemented in Maxent and two thresholds of presence/absence by projecting the modern climate envelope onto four Global Circulation Models forecasted for two time periods (2050s and 2070s). The climate envelope, as estimated from the species present climatic range, is predicted to shrink by up to 49{\%} by the 2050s and up to 64{\%} by the 2070s. The greatest predicted reduction is in Victoria with 91-100{\%} of its current range being climatically unsuitable by the 2070s. Climatically similar areas to the species present range are predicted to remain in mountainous areas of western Tasmania, the Northeast Highlands of Tasmania, and the Baw Baw Plateau in the Central Highlands of Victoria. However, region-specific modelling approaches made very different predictions from the whole-range based models, especially in the severity of the predicted decline for Victorian populations of N. cunninghamii which occur in much warmer climates than the rest of the species geographical range. This shows that, for widespread species that span a range of climate zones, the exposure of current populations to climate change may be better modelled using a regional based approach. How the species responds to climate change will depend on the species ability to respond to drier and warmer climates and the concomitant increase in fire intensity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Ecological Society of Australia.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis studies the public opinions towards an entity, and it is an important research area in data mining. Recently, a lot of sentiment analysis models have been proposed, including supervised and unsupervised approaches. However, the role of supervised models has been undermined by the phenomenon of big data, and the unsupervised ones are drawing more and more attention. But, most current unsupervised methods are based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and they need to specify the number of aspects in advance, making them subjective. In addition, these methods treat factual words and opinioned words the same, and assume that one sentence contains only one aspect, all of which make the existing unsupervised methods unsatisfactory. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel hybrid Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (HDP-LDA) model. This model can automatically determine the number of aspects, distinguish factual words from opinioned words, and further effectively extracts the aspect specific sentiment words. Experiment result shows that our model can clearly capture the aspects people mentioned and the specific sentiment words they use in each aspect, improving the performance of sentiment analysis efficiently. At last, we compared our model with the influential topic models, namely, JST, AUSM and MaxEnt-LDA, on the online restaurant review, and found our model performs very well. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {In an increasingly human-dominated world, conservation requires the mitigation of conflicts between large mammals and people. Conflicts are particularly problematic when resources are limited, such as at wintering sites. Such conflicts have fragmented many large mammal populations, making reintroductions in suitable sites necessary. Broad-scale habitat suitability mapping can help to identify sites for species' reintroductions. The European bison is a good example of a large mammal that is restricted to only a fraction of its former range. The goal of our study was to identify and assess potential habitat for European bison in the Caucasus Mountains, which is a part of its former range and has the potential to harbor larger populations. Specifically, we used seasonal presence data from four reintroduced European bison populations and two sets of predictor variables to: (i) map habitat suitability for summer and winter, (ii) characterize habitat based on management-relevant categories that capture the potential for conflicts with people, and (iii) identify candidate sites for reintroductions. We found substantial areas of suitable habitat. However, areas of potential conflicts with people were widespread and often near highly suitable areas. We identified 69 potential reintroduction sites (10 230km2, 1.8{\%} of the ecoregion) that have suitable summer and winter habitat with relatively low risk of human-wildlife conflict. These results can guide conservation efforts in establishing a viable European bison metapopulation in the Caucasus ecoregion. More broadly, our results highlight the need to map large mammal habitat suitability for different seasons in order to derive meaningful conservation recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Many taxa are undergoing distribution shifts in response to anthropogenic climate change. However, detecting a climate signal in mobile species is difficult due to their wide-ranging, patchy distributions, often driven by natural climate variability. For example, difficulties associated with assessing pelagic fish distributions have rendered fisheries management ill-equipped to adapt to the challenges posed by climate change, leaving pelagic species and ecosystems vulnerable. Here, we demonstrate the value of citizen science data for modelling the dynamic habitat suitability of a mobile pelagic predator (black marlin, Istiompax indica) within the south-west Pacific Ocean. The extensive spatial and temporal coverage of our occurrence data set (n = 18 717), collected at high resolution ({\~{}}1.85 km2), enabled identification of suitable habitat at monthly time steps over a 16-year period (1998-2013). We identified considerable monthly, seasonal and interannual variability in the extent and distribution of suitable habitat, predominately driven by chlorophyll a and sea surface height. Interannual variability correlated with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, with suitable habitat extending up to {\~{}}300 km further south during La Nina events. Despite the strong influence of ENSO, our model revealed a rapid poleward shift in the geometric mean of black marlin habitat, occurring at 88.2 km decade-1. By incorporating multiple environmental factors at monthly time steps, we were able to demonstrate a rapid distribution shift in a mobile pelagic species. Our findings suggest that the rapid velocity of climate change in the south-west Pacific Ocean is likely affecting mobile pelagic species, indicating that they may be more vulnerable to climate change than previously thought. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

It follows that how the data used to calibrate the models are collected can have a great impact on prediction success. We evaluated the influence of different survey designs and their interaction with the modelling technique on SDM performance. Location: Iberian Peninsula. Methods: We examine how data recorded using seven alternative survey designs (random, systematic, environmentally stratified by class and environmentally stratified using P-median, biased due to accessibility, biased by human density aggregation and biased towards protected areas) could affect SDM predictions generated with nine modelling techniques (BIOCLIM, Gower distance, Mahalanobis distance, Euclidean distance, GLM, MaxEnt, ENFA and Random Forest). We also study how sample size, species' characteristics and modelling technique affected SDM predictive ability, using six evaluation metrics. Results: Survey design has a small effect on prediction success. Characteristics of species' ranges rank highest among the factors affecting SDM results: the species with lower relative occurrence area (ROA) are predicted better. Model predictions are also improved when sample size is large. Main conclusions: The species modelled - particularly the extent of its distribution - are the largest source of influence over SDM results. The environmental coverage of the surveys is more important than the spatial structure of the calibration data. Therefore, climatic biases in the data should be identified to avoid erroneous conclusions about the geographic patterns of species distributions. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: The flat-headed cat (Prionailurus planiceps) is one of the world's least known, highly threatened felids with a distribution restricted to tropical lowland rainforests in Peninsular Thailand/Malaysia, Borneo and Sumatra. Throughout its geographic range large-scale anthropogenic transformation processes, including the pollution of fresh-water river systems and landscape fragmentation, raise concerns regarding its conservation status. Despite an increasing number of cameratrapping field surveys for carnivores in South-East Asia during the past two decades, few of these studies recorded the flatheaded cat. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we designed a predictive species distribution model using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm to reassess the potential current distribution and conservation status of the flat-headed cat. Eighty-eight independent species occurrence records were gathered from field surveys, literature records, and museum collections. These current and historical records were analysed in relation to bioclimatic variables (WorldClim), altitude (SRTM) and minimum distance to larger water resources (Digital Chart of the World). Distance to water was identified as the key predictor for the occurrence of flat-headed cats ({\textgreater}50{\%} explanation). In addition, we used different land cover maps (GLC2000, GlobCover and SarVision LLC for Borneo), information on protected areas and regional human population density data to extract suitable habitats from the potential distribution predicted by the MaxEnt model. Between 54{\%} and 68{\%} of suitable habitat has already been converted to unsuitable land cover types (e.g. croplands, plantations), and only between 10{\%} and 20{\%} of suitable land cover is categorised as fully protected according to the IUCN criteria. The remaining habitats are highly fragmented and only a few larger forest patches remain. Conclusion/Significance: Based on our findings, we recommend that future conservation efforts for the flat-headed cat should focus on the identified remaining key localities and be implemented through a continuous dialogue between local stakeholders, conservationists and scientists to ensure its long-term survival. The flat-headed cat can serve as a flagship species for the protection of several other endangered species associated with the threatened tropical lowland forests and surface fresh-water sources in this region. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wilting et al.},

Habitat suitability modeling provides a tool for researchers and managers to understand the potential extent of invasive species spread. Our goal was to use habitat suitability modeling to map potential habitat of the riparian plant invader, Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia). Russian olive has invaded riparian habitat across North America and is continuing to expand its range. We compiled 11 disparate datasets for Russian olive presence locations (n = 1,051 points and 139 polygons) in the western US and used Maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling to develop two habitat suitability maps for Russian olive in the western United States: one with coarse-scale water data and one with fine-scale water data. Our models were able to accurately predict current suitable Russian olive habitat (Coarse model: training AUC = 0.938, test AUC = 0.907; Fine model: training AUC = 0.923, test AUC = 0.885). Distance to water was the most important predictor for Russian olive presence in our coarse-scale water model, but it was only the fifth most important variable in the fine-scale model, suggesting that when water bodies are considered on a fine scale, Russian olive does not necessarily rely on water. Our model predicted that Russian olive has suitable habitat further west from its current distribution, expanding into the west coast and central North America. Our methodology proves useful for identifying potential future areas of invasion. Model results may be influenced by locations of cultivated individuals and sampling bias. Further study is needed to examine the potential for Russian olive to invade beyond its current range. Habitat suitability modeling provides an essential tool for enhancing our understanding of invasive species spread. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of global climate change on the potential geographic distribution, productivity, and value of production of H. speciosa in Brazil. We used MaxEnt to estimate the potential geographic distribution of the species in current and future (2050) climate scenarios. We obtained the productivity and value of production for 74 municipalities in Brazil. Moreover, to explain the variation the productivity and value of production, we constructed 15 models based on four variables: two ecological (ecological niche model and the presence of Unity of conservation) and two socio-economic (gross domestic product and human developed index). The models were selected using Akaike Information Criteria. Our results suggest that municipalities currently harvesting H. speciosa will have lower harvest rates in the future (mainly in northeastern Brazil). The best model to explain the productivity was ecological niche model; thus, municipalities with higher productivity are inserted in regions with higher environmental suitability (indicated by niche model). Thus, in the future, the municipalities harvesting H. speciosa will produce less because there will be less suitable habitat for H. speciosa, which in turn will affect the H. speciosa harvest and the local economy. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Although species distribution models (SDMs) have been widely used for organisms occupying contiguous spatial extents, the implementation of SDMs in relatively complex and segmented riverine networks is still at its early stage. In this study, we explicitly modelled the headwater stream habitat for the threatened blackside dace (Phoxinus cumberlandensis) endemic to the upper Cumberland River, Kentucky, USA. An occurrence record data set, along with variables describing stream properties and land use impacts, was used to predict the fish habitat suitability at the stream segment level. An approach combining geographic information systems and the maximum entropy species distribution modelling (MaxEnt) was adopted. Results demonstrated that natural conditions and land use disturbances, respectively, form the primary and secondary environmental constraints on the species' habitat. We generated regional-scale management-friendly maps showing subwatershed habitat suitability and locations of the clustered suitable habitats (hotspots) and thus set an example for spatially explicit management of threatened and endangered riverine species.

abstract = {Rapid deforestation has occurred in northern Thailand and is expected to continue. Thus, identification and protection of sufficient amounts of the highest quality habitat is urgent. Wildlife occurrence data were gathered along wildlife trails and patrolling routes in protected areas and forest patches outside of protected areas. Geographic Information Systems, bio-physical and anthropogenic variables were used to generate suitable habitats for 17 mammal species using maximum entropy theory (MAXENT). Suitable habitats for all species were aggregated, and used to set priorities for wildlife conservation in northern Thailand. In addition, predicted deforestation was overlaid on moderate and high priority areas to determine future wildlife threats and aid decision-making concerning which areas to protect. The results revealed that the total extent of suitable habitats for the studied species covers approximately 37{\%} of the region. Nearly 70{\%} of the total habitat for endangered and vulnerable species is predicted in large and contiguous protected areas. Threatened areas with high biodiversity encompass approximately 1.9{\%} of the region, and 66{\%} of this figure is predicted to occur in existing protected areas. Based on the model outcomes, we recommend reducing human pressures, enhancing the density of prey species and conservation outside protected areas, as well as increasing connectivity of suitable habitats among protected areas that are too small to maintain viable populations in isolation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Rickettsia montanensis has long been considered a nonpathogenic member of the spotted fever group rickettsiae. However, the infection potential of R. montanensis is being revisited in light of its recent association with a case of human infection in the United States and the possibility that additional cases may have been misdiagnosed as Rocky Mountain spotted fever. To this end, DNA was extracted from American dog ticks (Dermacentor variabilis) removed from Department of Defense (DoD) personnel and their dependents at DoD medical treatment facilities (MTFs) during 2002-2012 (n = 4792). These 4792 samples were analyzed for the presence of R. montanensis (n = 136; 2.84{\%}) and all vector DNA was confirmed to be of D. variabilis origin using a novel Dermacentor genus-specific quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction procedure, Derm, and a novel Dermacentor species multilocus sequence typing assay. To assess the risk of R. montanensis infection, the positive and negative samples were geographically mapped utilizing MTF site locations. Tick localities were imported into a geographical information systems (GIS) program, ArcGIS, for mapping and analysis. The ecological niche modeling (ENM) program, Maxent, was used to estimate the probability of tick presence in eastern United States using locations of both R. montanensis-positive and -negative ticks, climate, and elevation data. The ENM for R. montanensis-positive D. variabilis estimated high probabilities of the positive ticks occurring in two main areas, including the northern Midwest and mid-Atlantic portions of the northeastern regions of United States, whereas the R. montanensis-negative D. variabilis tick model showed a wider estimated range. The results suggest that R. montanensis-positive and -negative D. variabilis have different ranges where humans may be at risk and are influenced by similar and different factors. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.},

The spatial distribution has continued to expand, while the areas at potential high risk of SFTS have, to date, remained unclear. Methods: Using ecological factors as predictors, the MaxEnt model was first trained based on the locations of human SFTS occurrence in Shandong Province. The risk prediction map of China was then created by projecting the training model onto the whole country. The performance of the model was assessed using the known locations of disease occurrence in China. Results: The key environmental factors affecting SFTS occurrence were temperature, precipitation, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and duration of sunshine. The risk prediction maps suggested that central, southwestern, northeastern, and the eastern coast of China are potential areas at high risk of SFTS. Conclusions: The potential high risk SFTS areas are distributed widely in China. The epidemiological surveillance system should be enhanced in these high risk regions. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

Various correlative and mechanistic methods can be applied to build predictive distributions of living organisms in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Correlative methods used to predict species' potential distribution have been described as either group discrimination techniques or profile techniques. We attempted to determine whether group discrimination techniques could perform as well as profile techniques for predicting species potential distributions, using elevation (ELVN), parent material (ROCK), slope (SLOP), radiation index (Rl) and topographic position index (TPI)) as explanatory variables. We compared potential distribution predictions made for Crimean juniper (Juniperus excelsa Bieb.) in the Yukari g{\"{o}}kdere forest district of the Mediterranean region, Turkey, applying four group discrimination techniques (discriminate analysis (DA), logistic regression analysis (LR), generalized addictive model (GAM) and classification tree technique (CT)) and two profile techniques (a maximum entropy approach to species distribution modeling (MAXENT), the genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction (GARP)). Visual assessments of the potential distribution probability of the applied models for Crimean juniper were performed by using geographical information systems (GIS). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to objectively assess model performance. The results suggested that group discrimination techniques are better than profile techniques and, among the group discrimination techniques, GAM indicated the best performance.},

abstract = {In the marine realm, climate change can affect a variety of physico-chemical properties with wide-ranging biological effects, but the knowledge of how climate change affects benthic distributions is limited and mainly restricted to coastal environments. To project the response of benthic species of a shelf sea (North Sea) to the expected climate change, the distributions of 75 marine benthic species were modelled and the spatial changes in distribution were projected for 2099 based on modelled bottom temperature and salinity changes using the IPCC scenario A1B. Mean bottom temperature was projected to increase between 0.15 and 5.4 °C, while mean bottom salinity was projected to moderately increase by 1.7. The spatial changes in species distribution were modelled with Maxent and the direction and extent of these changes were assessed. The results showed a latitudinal northward shift for 64{\%} of the species (maximum 109 km; brittle star Ophiothrix fragilis) and a southward shift for 36{\%} (maximum 101 km; hermit crab Pagurus prideaux and the associated cloak anemone Adamsia carciniopados; 105 km). The relatively low rates of distributional shifts compared to fish or plankton species were probably influenced by the regional topography. The environmental gradients in the central North Sea along the 50 m depth contour might act as a 'barrier', possibly resulting in a compression of distribution range and hampering further shifts to the north. For 49 species this resulted in a habitat loss up to 100{\%}, while only 11 species could benefit from the warming in terms of habitat gain. Particularly the benthic communities of the southern North Sea, where the strongest temperature increase was projected, would be strongly affected by the distributional changes, since key species showed northward shifts and high rates of habitat loss, with potential ramifications for the functioning of the ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Seasonal changes in the distribution of animals can have an important impact on the ecosystem. In agricultural landscapes, the seasonal movement of the wild boar Sus scrofa towards field crops often results in damages and makes control of the population difficult. The plasticity of the species to cope with different habitats is largely proven, but the environmental and human drivers of this seasonal habitat shift at the population scale remain largely unknown. Using MaxEnt and two seasonally distinct presence datasets, we contrasted the distribution of wild boar in southern Belgium during the growing and hunting seasons to (i) analyse seasonal drivers of the distribution and (ii) forecast the potential spread of the species north to its current distribution. We demonstrated that during the growing season, wild boar range almost double, owing to the cover and food provided by agricultural areas, thereby enhancing the movement and spread of the species. We found that the seasonal distribution of wild boar in agricultural lands is mostly influenced by the search for cover and food provided alternatively by forest and field crops. Interestingly, it seems that this search for cover operates under the constraint of a threshold distance. Our results indeed reveal an increased probability of presence not only in the vicinity of forests but also above a threshold distance of 865 m from the forest edge, suggesting that wild boar can overcome the dependence to forest cover. The forecast distribution of wild boar highlighted a potential increase of the current range into suitable habitat between 63 and 168 km2. To counteract the potential spread of the species into agricultural habitats and the consecutive damages, we insist on the need for the development of integrated management strategies, combining land use spatial configuration and wild boar spatial behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Malaria is considered as an endemic mosquito borne disease in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Previous investigations addressed the diseases incidences in KSA, however few studies highlighted the mosquito vectors habitats characterization in regards to ecological variables. Ecological models of mosquito vectors will help in defining potential suitable habitats for their spatial distribution and understanding how much the ecological variables contribute in delineating these suitable habitats. This information will help in developing targeted surveillance and control strategies. Ecological niche modeling was carried out using the evolutionary algorithms implemented in maximum entropy (MaxEnt) to predict the suitable larval habitats of two malaria vectors, Anopheles gambiae s.l. and An. sergentii (Theobald) in Al-Baha Province, KSA. Climatic and topographical data layers from Worldclim databases and larval occurrence records were used to model the two malaria vectors. Six topographical and four bioclimatic variables were significantly predict An. gambiae larval suitable habitat. Both streams covered with vegetation and algae and elevation above sea level were strong predictors of distribution of this mosquito vector. However, for An. sergentii, four topographical and ten bioclimatic variables were found to be significant predictors of suitable habitat distribution. Soil and altitude were strong predictors of An. sergentii distribution. Also, the linear regression statistical analysis (LM) indicates non linear correlation between TDS/pH and abundance of these two mosquito species. Copyright 2015 Zoological Society of Pakistan.},

By adopting the spirit of Sequence Memoizer, our approach gives reasonable named entity labels to the elements in the given sequences, based on the better modeling of the context word distributions. Compared with the traditional generative models like Hidden Markov Model, our approach works better on capturing the power-law scaling and the long range dependencies of natural language. Our method is evaluated on the JNLPBA 2004 dataset and compared with the classic generative and discriminative approaches. The experimental results have shown that it outperforms the HMM model and is comparable with the Maxent model. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Aim To test the prediction that environmental suitability derived from species distribution modelling (SDM) could be a surrogate for jaguar local population density estimates. Location Americas. Methods We used 1409 occurrence records of jaguars to model the distribution of the species using 11 SDM methods. We tested whether models' suitability is linearly correlated with jaguar population densities estimated from 37 different locations. We evaluated whether the relationship between density and suitability forms a constraint envelope, in which higher densities are found mainly in regions with high suitability, whereas low densities can occur in regions with variable suitability. We tested this using heteroscedasticity test and quantile regressions. Results A positive linear relationship between suitability and jaguar density was found only for four methods [bioclimatic envelope (BIOCLIM), genetic algorithm for rule set production (GARP), maximum entropy (Maxent) and generalized boosting models (GBM)], but with weak explanatory power. BIOCLIM showed the strongest relationship. Variance of suitability for lower densities values was larger than for higher values for many of the SDM models used, but the quantile regression was significantly positive only for BIOCLIM and random forests (RF). RF and GBM provided the most accurate models when measured with the standard SDM evaluation metrics, but possess poor relationship with local density estimates. Main conclusions Results indicate that the relationship between density and suitability could be better described as a triangular constraint envelope than by a straight positive relationship, and some of the SDM methods tested here were able to discriminate regions with high or low local population densities. Low jaguar densities can occur in areas with low or high suitability, whereas high values are restricted to areas where the suitability is greater. In high suitability areas but with low jaguar density estimates, we discuss how extrinsic factors driving abundance could act at local scales and then prevent higher densities that would be expected by the favourable regional environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Future climate change is likely to affect distributions of species, disrupt biotic interactions, and cause spatial incongruity of predator–prey habitats. Understanding the impacts of future climate change on species distribution will help in the formulation of conservation policies to reduce the risks of future biodiversity losses. Using a species distribution modeling approach by MaxEnt, we modeled current and future distributions of snow leopard (Panthera uncia) and its common prey, blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur), and observed the changes in niche overlap in the Nepal Himalaya. Annual mean temperature is the major climatic factor responsible for the snow leopard and blue sheep distributions in the energy-deficient environments of high altitudes. Currently, about 15.32{\%} and 15.93{\%} area of the Nepal Himalaya are suitable for snow leopard and blue sheep habitats, respectively. The bioclimatic models show that the current suitable habitats of both snow leopard and blue sheep will be reduced under future climate change. The predicted suitable habitat of the snow leopard is decreased when blue sheep habitats is incorporated in the model. Our climate-only model shows that only 11.64{\%} (17,190 km2) area of Nepal is suitable for the snow leopard under current climate and the suitable habitat reduces to 5,435 km2 (reduced by 24.02{\%}) after incorporating the predicted distribution of blue sheep. The predicted distribution of snow leopard reduces by 14.57{\%} in 2030 and by 21.57{\%} in 2050 when the predicted distribution of blue sheep is included as compared to 1.98{\%} reduction in 2030 and 3.80{\%} reduction in 2050 based on the climate-only model. It is predicted that future climate may alter the predator–prey spatial interaction inducing a lower degree of overlap and a higher degree of mismatch between snow leopard and blue sheep niches. This suggests increased energetic costs of finding preferred prey for snow leopards – a species already facing energetic constraints due to the limited dietary resources in its alpine habitat. Our findings provide valuable information for extension of protected areas in future. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim: Species distribution models and geographical information system (GIS) technologies are becoming increasingly important tools in conservation planning and decision-making. Often the rich data bases of museums and herbaria serve as the primary data for predicting species distributions. Yet key assumptions about the primary data often are untested, and violation of such assumptions may have consequences for model predictions. For example, users of primary data assume that sampling has been random with respect to geography and environmental gradients. Here we evaluate the assumption that plant voucher specimens adequately sample the climatic gradient and test whether violation of this assumption influences model predictions. Location: Bolivia and Ecuador. Methods: Using 323,711 georeferenced herbarium collections and nine climatic variables, we predicted the distribution of 76 plant species using maximum entropy models (MAXENT) with training points that sampled the climate environments randomly and training points that reflected the climate bias in the herbarium collections. To estimate the distribution of species, MAXENT finds the distribution of maximum entropy (i.e. closest to uniform) subject to the constraint that the expected value for each environmental variable under the estimated distribution matches its empirical average. The experimental design included species that differed in geographical range and elevation; all species were modelled with 20 and 100 training points. We examined the influence of the number of training points and climate bias in training points, elevation and range size on model performance using analysis of variance models. Results: We found that significant parts of the climatic gradient were poorly represented in herbarium collections for both countries. For the most part, existing climatic bias in collections did not greatly affect distribution predictions when compared with an unbiased data set. Although the effects of climate bias on prediction accuracy were found to be greater where geographical ranges were characterized by high spatial variation in the degree of climate bias (i.e. ranges where the bias of the various climates sampled by collections deviated considerably from the mean bias), the greatest influence on model performance was the number of presence points used to train the model. Main conclusions: These results demonstrate that predictions of species distributions can be quite good despite existing climatic biases in primary data found in natural history collections, if a sufficiently large number of training points is available. Because of consistent overprediction of models, these results also confirm the importance of validating models with independent data or expert opinion. Failure to include independent model validation, especially in cases where training points are limited, may potentially lead to grave errors in conservation decision-making and planning. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

abstract = {Although niche-based and stochastic processes, including dispersal limitation and demographic stochasticity, can each contribute to community assembly, it is difficult to quantify the relative importance of each process in natural vegetation. Here, we extend Shipley's maxent model (Community Assembly by Trait Selection, CATS) for the prediction of relative abundances to incorporate both trait-based filtering and dispersal limitation from the larger landscape and develop a statistical decomposition of the proportions of the total information content of relative abundances in local communities that are attributable to traitbased filtering, dispersal limitation, and demographic stochasticity. We apply the method to tree communities in a mature, species-rich, tropical forest in French Guiana at 1-, 0.25-and 0.04-ha scales. Trait data consisted of species' means of 17 functional traits measured over both the entire meta-community and separately in each of nine 1-ha plots. Trait means calculated separately for each site always gave better predictions. There was clear evidence of trait-based filtering at all spatial scales. Trait-based filtering was the most important process at the 1-ha scale (34{\%}), whereas demographic stochasticity was the most important at smaller scales (37-53{\%}). Dispersal limitation from the meta-community was less important and approximately constant across scales (∼9{\%}), and there was also an unresolved association between site-specific traits and meta-community relative abundances. Our method allows one to quantify the relative importance of local niche-based and meta-community processes and demographic stochasticity during community assembly across spatial and temporal scales. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Abstract Many hornbill species in Thailand are categorized as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The objectives of this research were to predict hornbill distributions in Thailand and to assess the national conservation status of the species using extent of occurrence. We employed maximum entropy modelling, using 10 environmental variables that were believed to directly or indirectly influence hornbill distributions across Thailand, to predict the habitats potentially suitable for 10 of the country's 13 hornbill species. Data on the presence of hornbills were gathered from the Thailand Hornbill Project and additional field surveys in protected area complexes during 2004-2006. The results indicated that patch size is the most important factor affecting distribution, followed by latitude, ecoregion and distance to villages. All hornbill species were predicted to occur primarily in intact protected area complexes. The total extent of all hornbill habitats covers 9.3{\%} of the country's land area. Seven of the 10 modelled species are at risk and the current distribution pattern is expected to reflect stochastic extinctions because of small population size. We recommend that the conservation status of Austen's brown hornbill Anorrhinus austeni and Tickell's brown hornbill Anorrhinus tickelli should be changed from Vulnerable to Endangered. The model identified five protected area complexes as hornbill hotspots in Thailand. These findings will help guide conservation management. {\textcopyright} 2013 Fauna {\&} Flora International.},

abstract = {The papers in this Forum discussion debate various aspects of my maximum entropy model of community assembly. The questions raised centre around (1) the possible mechanisms generating the patterns predicted by my maxent model of community assembly, and (2) the appropriate statistical methods for testing the patterns. Here I briefly explain the proposed mechanistic basis of the model: natural selection occurring between individuals of different species. If trait differences are linked to differential demographic probabilities (i.e. fitness differences) then natural selection will constrain the average trait values found in the community and such average ('community-aggregated') traits will then possess information that is translated into the maximum entropy probabilities. If community assembly is strictly neutral then the maxent model will have no predictive ability. This also justifies the null model, and the permutation test, proposed by Roxburgh and Mokany. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2010 Oikos.},

abstract = {A major limitation to fully integrated ecosystem based fishery management approaches is a lack of information on the spatial distribution of marine species and the environmental conditions shaping these distributions. This is particularly problematic for deep-water species that are hard to sample and are data poor. The past decade has seen the rapid development of a suite of advanced species distribution, or ecological niche, modelling approaches developed specifically to support efficient and targeted management. However, model performance can vary significantly and the appropriateness of which methods are best for a given application remains questionable. Species distribution models were developed for three commercially valuable Hawaiian deep-water eteline snappers: Etelis coruscans (Onaga), Etelis carbunculus (Ehu) and Pristipomoides filamentosus (Opakapaka). Distributional data for these species was relatively sparse. To identify the best method, model performance and distributional accuracy was assessed and compared using three approaches: Generalised Additive Models (GAM), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt). Independent spatial validation data found MaxEnt consistently provided better model performance with 'good' model predictions (AUC ={\textgreater}0.8). Each species was influenced by a unique combination of environmental conditions, with depth, terrain (slope) and substrate (low lying unconsolidated sediments), being the three most important in shaping their distributions. Sustainable fisheries management, marine spatial planning and environmental decision support systems rely on an understanding species distribution patterns and habitat linkages. This study demonstrates that predictive species distribution modelling approaches can be used to accurately model and map sparse species distribution data across marine landscapes. The approach used herein was found to be an accurate tool to delineate species distributions and associated habitat linkages, account for species-specific differences and support sustainable ecosystem-based management. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

For bats, the availability and environmental condition of caves can be a limiting factor. The cave specialist Natalus macrourus (formerly Natalus espiritosantensis) is categorized as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List but as Vulnerable in Brazil, based on a projected population reduction and a decline in its area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat. There is a lack of knowledge about the species' distribution, natural history and ecology, information that is required for conservation. Using new occurrence data and potential distribution modelling we evaluated the distribution of N. macrourus in Brazil, analysed pressures on and threats to the species, and assessed the species' conservation needs. Natalus macrourus is positively associated with areas with higher probability of cave occurrence and negatively associated with areas of high variation in mean daily temperature and mean annual rainfall. Areas with high environmental suitability for N. macrourus correspond to only 3{\%} of the potential distribution modelled. We estimate that the species has already lost 54{\%} of its natural habitat and that there is {\textless} 35{\%} of habitat remaining in areas with high environmental suitability. We calculated that approximately half of the caves in areas with high environmental suitability are {\textless} 5 km from mining operations and only 4{\%} of the species' potential distribution lies within protected areas. Given the strong association of N. macrourus with caves, it is important to protect these habitats, and we recommend that caves where the species is present should receive immediate protection.

Habitat suitability models were developed using MaxEnt modelling software for a range of environmental factors; sea-surface temperature, mixed layer depth, depth, slope, chlorophyll a concentration, sea surface salinity, distance to the 200 m contour. We predicted species exposure to fishing gears by integrating habitat suitability models with information on fishing vessel activities within the study area. The main predictors of habitat suitability for all species were topographic variables, particularly depth and slope, highlighted by two areas of high species richness around areas of topographic heterogeneity, along the continental shelf and on the west coast. Combining habitat models with fishing activity, indicated areas of high exposure off the north and south coasts and in an area known as the Porcupine Bank off the west coast. These results are valuable for conservation and management of cetaceans and fisheries in the study area. Methods can be easily adjusted to allow replication for other species and other anthropogenic activities. We recommend future effort focuses on winter months to fill in the gaps on year round cetacean distribution. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Several factors can influence primate distributions, including evolutionary history, interspecific competition, climate, and anthropogenic impacts. In Madagascar, several small spatial scale studies have shown that anthropogenic habitat modification affects the density and distribution of many lemur species. Ecological niche models can be used to examine broad-scale influences of anthropogenic impacts on primate distributions. In this study, we examine how climate and anthropogenic factors influence the distribution of 11 Eulemur species using ecological niche models. Specifically, we created one set of models only using rainfall and temperature variables. We then created a second set of models that combined these climate variables with three anthropogenic factors: distance to dense settlements, villages, and croplands. We used MaxEnt to generate all the models. We found that the addition of anthropogenic variables improved the climate models. Also, most Eulemur species exhibited reduced predicted geographic distributions once anthropogenic factors were added to the model. Distance to dense settlements was the most important anthropogenic factor in most cases. We suggest that including anthropogenic variables in ecological niche models is important for understanding primate distributions, especially in regions with significant human impacts. In addition, we identify several Eulemur species that were most affected by anthropogenic factors and should be the focus of increased conservation efforts. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Where does suitable habitat for Juniperus oxycedrus exist within the study area and which bioclimatic variables prove to be most important in the prediction of J. oxycedrus potential distribution? Location: Central High Atlas, Morocco. Methods: Ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA), maximum entropy approach (MAXENT) and generalized linear models (GLM) were applied to either presence-only data of J. oxycedrus (ENFA and MAXENT) or presence-absence data (GLM), using bioclimatic variables as predictors. Model accuracy of ENFA, MAXENT and GLM was assessed using their specific evaluation measures and prediction success by means of the minimal predicted area (MPA). Finally, the three maps of potential species distribution were intersected to investigate their consistency in the geographic distribution of predicted suitable habitat. Results: Species distribution models calculated by ENFA, MAXENT and GLM show good model quality according to their evaluation measures. However, calculation of MPA revealed considerable discrepancies in geographic distribution and spatial extent of areas predicted as suitable habitat for J. oxycedrus. Conclusion: Suitable habitat for J. oxycedrus is predicted using all applied modelling approaches in 8{\%} of the study area (mostly the north-western part). MAXENT gave the best results considering model accuracy and prediction success according to the MPA scores. Predictors representing maximum temperature and potential radiation were selected in all methods to explain species occurrences.

We analyzed data for 1992 (dry year with 20 water points) and 2000 (wet year with 30 water points) against presence-only data for five packs of L. pictus in a part of Hwange National Park and adjacent smallholder communal farming areas in western Zimbabwe. Modelling the potential habitat for L. pictus using Maxent with distance from water points (Dw) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as predictor variables was successful for 2000 (AUC = 0.793) but not successful for 1992 (AUC = 0.423), with L. pictus probability of occurrence near water points being more for year 2000 than for year 1992. The predicted L. pictus range was wider in 1992 (∼13888.1 km2) than in 2000 (∼958.4 km2) (Test of Proportions, $\chi$2 = 124.52, df = 1, P = 0.00). Using the 2nd order Multitype Nearest Neighbour Distance Function (Gcross), we also observed significant attraction between L. pictus and water points within only ∼1km radius for 1992 but up to ∼8km radius for 2000. Our study reinforced the notion that surface water resources attract wild dogs in the savannahs but paradoxically less so when water resources are scarce. In particular, our study furthers current understanding of the effects of changing water availability regimes on the endangered L. pictus, providing evidence that the endangered predator's home range encroaches into potential ecological traps (i.e., smallholder communal farming areas) when water resources are scarce. {\textcopyright} 2016 Ndaimani et al.

Teak (Tectona grandis) is one of the most valuable tropical hardwood species in the international timber market, and natural teak forests are distributed from India through Myanmar, Laos and Thailand. The extents of teak forests are shrinking due to deforestation and the local impacts of global climate change. However, the direct impacts of climate changes on the continental-scale distributions of native and non-native teak have not been examined. In this study, we developed a species distribution model for teak across its entire native distribution in tropical Asia, and its non-native distribution in Bangladesh. We used presence-only records of trees and twelve environmental variables that were most representative for current teak distributions in South and Southeast Asia. MaxEnt (maximum entropy) models were used to model the distributions of teak under current and future climate scenarios. We found that land use/land cover change and elevation were the two most important variables explaining the current and future distributions of native and non-native teak in tropical Asia. Changes in annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality and annual mean actual evapotranspiration may result in shifts in the distributions of teak across tropical Asia. We discuss the implications for the conservation of critical teak habitats, forest management planning, and risks of biological invasion that may occur due to its cultivation in non-native ranges. {\textcopyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

The quantitative food content analysis in the northern part of the Curonian Lagoon suggests that during their ?first year of life N. melanostomus juveniles rely on chironomid larvae, ostracods and amphi- pods, while beginning with the second year of life, mussels, zebra mussels in particular, constitute over a half of their diet. Moreover, feeding specialisation of N. melanostomus seems to increase with body size growth. Analysis of food items in the round goby's diet showed that its diet is broad. However, molluscs and higher crustaceans, including amphipods, appeared to be of primary importance for 2+ year gobies in the Klaipėda Strait and the northern part of the Curonian Lagoon.

We tested this hypothesis for the example of common wall lizard Podarcis muralis (Laur.), and showed that it tolerates a wide range of different climatic factors, therefore could be potentially distributed more to the north from the northern limit of its native range. However, the main factor limiting the occurrence of the lizard in its northern range is the presence of suitable habitats, particularly rocky areas. Human economic activity in mid-latitude Europe resulted in the development of such suitable habitats in areas of advantageous climatic conditions. In this way, humans created niches suitable for the species as well as provided routes of access to these areas, what resulted in the increase the range of this lizard to the north. {\textcopyright} NwjZ, Oradea, Romania, 2015.},

abstract = {Climate change is likely to shift the distributions of ecosystems worldwide. Most assessments of climate change are primarily species-focused and do not directly estimate how entire ecosystems may change. Using an ecosystem-based modelling approach, we provide a region-wide climate change vulnerability assessment of the seven major ecosystems across Africa's Albertine Rift. The Albertine Rift is a global biodiversity hotspot, containing more endemic vertebrates than anywhere else in Africa. We used Maxent to estimate each ecosystem's extent using current climate data, then we projected the potential distribution of each ecosystem for 2050 and 2070. We found that suitable conditions for most ecosystems are predicted to contract rapidly in extent and shift upwards in altitude. High-altitude ecosystems and the endemic species they support are at immediate risk, owing to rapid predicted shrinkage in their suitable extent. Only the Combretum-grasslands savannah ecosystem is predicted to expand, with suitable conditions increasing by 32{\%} in area by 2050. The extent and structure of boundary zones between the Rift's ecosystems may change significantly through time, due to the contractions and shifts of the environmental conditions for existing ecosystem distributions. By 2070, 44{\%} of the region could be climatically unsuitable for the current ecosystems. Conservation planning across the Rift will need to account for these ecosystem shifts and rapidly changing boundary zones to ensure the long-term persistence of the many endemic species. Beyond the Albertine Rift, this ecosystem-based modelling technique can be adapted to any terrestrial region, providing critical information for conservation vulnerability assessments. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The deciduous tree species Pterocarpus angolensis occurs in the dry woodlands of southern Africa and grows under a broad range of environmental conditions. It is threatened by overharvesting due to its valuable timber (Blood wood, Kiaat) and by land use changes. Information on the most suitable environmental conditions for the species is often old and anecdotal, while available data on its occurrence refer to range extent and not to distribution. Species distribution models (SDM) could provide more accurate information on distribution and environmental requirements and thereby assist sustainable management of this tree species.Maxent models were developed to estimate the potential, realised and future distribution of P. angolensis and to identify detailed environmental requirements. Occurrences data of the species were sourced from herbaria and other published sources; environmental data from global GIS databases. Relevant environmental predictors were selected through a jack-knife test of the first model runs. The addition of information on competing species, fires and deforestation was tested to determine realised distribution. Model quality was evaluated with an independent presence-absence dataset. The model was projected with two different climate change scenarios to study their effect on the distribution by 2080.Results show that a potential distribution map can be obtained with good discrimination of the presence of the species (AUC 0.83) and fairly good calibration (correlation coefficient 0.61). Range extent and environmental requirements are more detailed than those described in literature. The distribution of the species is mainly influenced by the amount of summer rainfall, by the minimum temperature in winter and by temperature seasonality. Potential and realised distributions are very similar, with Madagascar as major exception where the species can grow but does not occur. Adding the fire history of the last 13. years or the distribution maps of potentially competing species as predictor variables did not improve the distribution model. It did illustrate that P. angolensis is mainly found in areas with annual fire frequency below 45{\%} and that only a few of the tested species show signs of competition. Using a forest cover map improved the realised distribution slightly (Kappa coefficient 0.64). Climate change can decrease the species range considerably, especially in the west, threatening species existence in Namibia and Botswana. On the other hand, the species' occurrence is predicted to increase in Zambia. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Over a period of 34,166 trap nights there were low photo rates (photo events/100 trap nights) for all species; 0.30 for golden cats, 0.15 for clouded leopards, 0.10 for marbled cats, and 0.08 for leopard cats. There is overlap in the predicted distributions of clouded leopards, golden cats, and marbled cats; indicating areas of high conservation importance for these species within the park. The predicted distribution of leopard cats was discrete from the other species which is important to consider in the development of conservation strategies.

Over a four-year period, we sampled for the presence of bats throughout North Dakota via mist netting (physical capture) and ultrasonic acoustic monitoring. We used maximum-entropy modeling to develop habitat suitability maps for each study species using physical capture data, acoustic data and both detection techniques combined. We evaluated the amount of niche overlap between maps to determine how sampling technique impacted the final SDMs and which technique was best for modeling SDMs for each species. We found variation among species in the amount of overlap between SDMs, ranging from pronounced differences (33.9{\%} overlap; Myotis septentrionalis) to highly similar models (80.4{\%} overlap; Myotis lucifugus). Our findings show that acoustic detection results in better SDMs for Myotis spp. while physical capture was best for modeling Eptesicus fuscus and Lasionycteris noctivagans. Although both methods produce highly reliable SDMs, care must be taken when using maximum-entropy modeling for species in which presence data can be gathered in multiple ways. We emphasize that researchers should consider the ecology and behavioral characteristics of their focal species to address any biases associated with sampling technique. {\textcopyright} Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.},

In this paper, the MaxEnt ecological niche model and GIS were used to analyze environmental variables that affect the distribution of this pest. Its potential distribution range and area in China were predicted. The predicted results were verified by the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve. The results suggested that V. vitifoliae has a wide potential distribution range in China. The eastern coastal region, Loess Plateau, and central areas of China are its primary suitable distribution regions, roughly from 100°E to 124°E, and from 24°N to 43°N. The potential invasive risk of V. vitifoliae is high in all major grape production provinces except Xinjiang. The potential distribution range of V. vitifoliae is far larger than its present distribution. There is great invasive expansion potential along with increased hazard to grape production. Air temperature, especially low temperature, is the key environmental variable affecting the potential distribution of V. vitifoliae, while the effects of moisture and soil texture are weaker than that of temperature. In reference to future global warming, the suitable distribution regions will likely shift from southern to northern China, and from low-altitude to high-altitude areas. {\textcopyright} 2015, editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

abstract = {Wedelia trilobata (L.) Hitchc., an ornamental groundcover plant introduced to areas around the world from Central America, has become invasive in many regions. To increase understanding of its geographic distribution and potential extent of spread, two presence-only niche-based modeling approaches (Maxent and GARP) were employed to create models based on occurrence records from its: (1) native range only and (2) full range (native and invasive). Models were then projected globally to identify areas vulnerable to W. trilobata invasion. W. trilobata prefers hot and humid environments and can occur in areas with different environmental conditions than experienced in its native range. Based on native and full occurrence points, GARP and Maxent models produced consistent distributional maps of W. trilobata, although Maxent model results were more conservative. When used to estimate the global invasive distribution of the species, both modeling approaches projected the species to occur in Africa. The GARP full model succeeded in predicting the known occurrences in Australia, while the other models failed to identify favorable habitats in this region. Given the rapid spread of W. trilobata and the serious risk of this species poses to local ecosystems, practical strategies to prevent the establishment and expansion of this species should be sought. {\textcopyright} 2015, The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer Japan.},

abstract = {Climate change is likely to alter wildfire regimes, but the significance of climate-driven factors in regional fire regimes over extended temporal scales is poorly understood. Comparison of the reconstructed fire dynamics from charcoals in sediments with modern active fires may provide clues about the drivers of wildfire activities, and help us validate models of fire activity for both the past and the future. Microscopic charcoals from Miocene sediments in Wenshan Basin (Yunnan, southwestern China), were used to reconstruct fire dynamics in deep time. Palaeoclimatic data were obtained from the previous quantitative reconstruction using pollen samples from a sedimentary sequence. The relationship between palaeoclimatic parameters and the ratio of charcoals during the Miocene was explored, and compared with maximum entropy (Maxent) model results throughout different time periods. Our results indicate that the temperature in the dry season was the main factor controlling the frequency of fire in Wenshan during the Miocene. Maxent modeling results based on the modern active fire dataset of Yunnan Province from NASA Earth observations are consistent with the results from fossil sediment analysis, that dry season temperature is the main driver of fire activity. Our findings suggest a significant fire-temperature relationship under the monsoonal climate since the Neogene. Furthermore, models suggest that the last-glacial maximum (LGM) had lower levels of fire activity than present, which increased during the Holocene prior to reaching present levels. Models also predict increases in fire activity across most of Yunnan in the future. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

In the Southern Ocean, which provides a critical habitat for several endangered cetacean species, seismic research activities are undertaken at a circumpolar scale. In order to minimize impacts of these surveys, pre-cruise planning requires detailed, spatio-temporally resolved knowledge on the likelihood of encountering these species in the survey area. In this publication we present predictive habitat modelling as a potential tool to support decisions for survey planning. We associated opportunistic sightings (2005-2011) of humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae, N=93) and Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis, N=139) with a range of static and dynamic environmental variables. A maximum entropy algorithm (Maxent) was used to develop habitat models and to calculate daily basinwide/circumpolar prediction maps to evaluate how species-specific habitat conditions evolved throughout the spring and summer months. For both species, prediction maps revealed considerable changes in habitat suitability throughout the season. Suitable humpback whale habitat occurred predominantly in ice-free areas, expanding southwards with the retreating sea ice edge, whereas suitable Antarctic minke whale habitat was consistently predicted within sea ice covered areas. Daily, large-scale prediction maps provide a valuable tool to design layout and timing of seismic surveys as they allow the identification and consideration of potential spatio-temporal hotspots to minimize potential impacts of seismic surveys on Antarctic cetacean species. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

We evaluated the predictive skill of models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Resulting models suggest poor suitability of most of Western Siberia for P. compressa. Minimum temperatures appeared to be the most important factor limiting the occurrence of P. compressa in Western Siberia. While P. compressa does not appear poised to expand greatly into Western Siberia under current climatic conditions, it may be able to expand considerably if the current trend of increasing minimum temperatures continues.},

While WNV incidence has been linked to environmental factors, particularly temperature and rainfall, little is known about how future climate change may affect the spread of the disease. Using available data on WNV infections in vectors and hosts collected from 2003-2011 and using a suite of 10 species distribution models, weighted according to their predictive performance, we modeled the incidence of WNV under current climate conditions at a continental scale. Models were found to accurately predict spatial patterns of WNV that were then used to examine how future climate may affect the spread of the disease. Predictions were accurate for cases of human WNV infection in the following year (2012), with areas reporting infections having significantly higher probability of presence as predicted by our models. Projected geographic distributions of WNV in North America under future climate for 2050 and 2080 show an expansion of suitable climate for the disease, driven by warmer temperatures and lower annual precipitation that will result in the exposure of new and na{\"{i}}ve host populations to the virus with potentially serious consequences.

This study was designed to model the spatial distribution of bottlenose dolphins among seasons of the year in the Mississippi Sound within the northern Gulf of Mexico. Models were constructed by integrating presence locations of dolphins acquired from line-transect sampling from 2011-2013 with maps of environmental conditions for the region to generate a likelihood of dolphin occurrence for winter (January-March), spring (April-June), summer (July-September), and autumn (October-December) using maximum entropy. Models were successfully generated using the program MaxEnt and had high predictive capacity for all seasons (AUC (area under curve) {\textgreater} 0.8). Distinct seasonal shifts in spatial distribution were evident including increased predicted occurrence in deepwater habitats during the winter, limited predicted occurrence in the western Mississippi Sound in winter and spring, widespread predicted occurrence over the entire region during summer, and a distinct westward shift of predicted occurrence in autumn. The most important environmental predictors used in SDMs were distance to shore, salinity, and nitrates, but variable importance differed considerably among seasons. Geographic shifts in predicted occurrence probably reflect both direct effects of changing environmental conditions and subsequent changes in prey availability and foraging efficiency. Overall, seasonal models helped to identify preferred habitats for dolphins among seasons of the year and can be used to inform management of this protected species in the northern Gulf of Mexico. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Species distribution modelling (SDM) is widely used in ecology, and predictions of species distributions inform both policy and ecological debates. Therefore, methods with high predictive accuracy and those that enable biological interpretation are preferable. Gaussian processes (GPs) are a highly flexible approach to statistical modelling and have recently been proposed for SDM. GP models fit smooth, but potentially complex response functions that can account for high-dimensional interactions between predictors. We propose fitting GP SDMs using deterministic numerical approximations, rather than Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in order to make GPs more computationally efficient and easy to use. We introduce GP models and their application to SDM, illustrate how ecological knowledge can be incorporated into GP SDMs via Bayesian priors and formulate a simple GP SDM that can be fitted efficiently. This model can be fitted either by learning the hyperparameters or by using a fixed approximation to them. Using a subset of the North American Breeding Bird Survey data set, we compare the out-of-sample predictive accuracy of these models with several commonly used SDM approaches for both presence/absence and presence-only data. Predictive accuracy of GP SDMs fitted by Laplace approximation was greater than boosted regression trees, generalized additive models (GAMs) and logistic regression when trained on presence/absence data and greater than all of these models plus MaxEnt when trained on presence-only data. GP SDMs fitted using a fixed approximation to hyperparameters were no less accurate than those with MAP estimation and on average 70 times faster, equivalent in speed to GAMs. As well as having strong predictive power for this data set, GP SDMs offer a convenient method for incorporating prior knowledge of the species' ecology. By fitting these methods using efficient numerical approximations, they may easily be applied to large data sets and automatically for many species. An r package, GRaF, is provided to enable SDM users to fit GP models. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.},

abstract = {Because their distribution usually depends on the presence of more than one species, modelling zoonotic diseases in humans differs from modelling individual species distribution even though the data are similar in nature. Three approaches can be used to model spatial distributions recorded by points: based on presence/absence, presence/available or presence data. Here, we compared one or two of several existing methods for each of these approaches.Human cases of hantavirus infection reported by place of infection between 1991 and 1998 in Sweden were used as a case study. Puumala virus (PUUV), the most common hantavirus in Europe, circulates among bank voles (Myodes glareolus). In northern Sweden, it causes nephropathia epidemica (NE) in humans, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.Logistic binomial regression and boosted regression trees were used to model presence and absence data. Presence and available sites (where the disease may occur) were modelled using cross-validated logistic regression. Finally, the ecological niche model MaxEnt, based on presence-only data, was used.In our study, logistic regression had the best predictive power, followed by boosted regression trees, MaxEnt and cross-validated logistic regression. It is also the most statistically reliable but requires absence data. The cross-validated method partly avoids the issue of absence data but requires fastidious calculations. MaxEnt accounts for non-linear responses but the estimators can be complex. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Zeimes et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Understanding species distributions and the factors limiting them is an important topic in ecology and conservation, including in nature reserve selection and predicting climate change impacts. While Species Distribution Models (SDM) are the main tool used for these purposes, choosing the best SDM algorithm is not straightforward as these are plentiful and can be applied in many different ways. SDM are used mainly to gain insight in 1) overall species distributions, 2) their past-present-future probability of occurrence and/or 3) to understand their ecological niche limits (also referred to as ecological niche modelling). The fact that these three aims may require different models and outputs is, however, rarely considered and has not been evaluated consistently. Here we use data from a systematically sampled set of species occurrences to specifically test the performance of Species Distribution Models across several commonly used algorithms. Species range in distribution patterns from rare to common and from local to widespread. We compare overall model fit (representing species distribution), the accuracy of the predictions at multiple spatial scales, and the consistency in selection of environmental correlations all across multiple modelling runs. As expected, the choice of modelling algorithm determines model outcome. However, model quality depends not only on the algorithm, but also on the measure of model fit used and the scale at which it is used. Although model fit was higher for the consensus approach and Maxent, Maxent and GAM models were more consistent in estimating local occurrence, while RF and GBM showed higher consistency in environmental variables selection. Model outcomes diverged more for narrowly distributed species than for widespread species. We suggest that matching study aims with modelling approach is essential in Species Distribution Models, and provide suggestions how to do this for different modelling aims and species' data characteristics (i.e. sample size, spatial distribution). {\textcopyright} 2013 Aguirre-Guti{\'{e}}rrez et al.},

To estimate the distribution of potential refugia during the last glacial maximum and migration routes for Trizeuxis the ecological niche modeling was performed. The potential niche modeling was done using maximum entropy method implemented in Maxent application based on the species presence-only observations. As input data climatic variables and the digital elevation model were used. Two models of suitable glacial habitats distribution were prepared - for the studied species and for its host. The compiled map of the suitable habitats distribution of T. falcata and P. guajava during the last glacial maximum (LGM) indicate two possible refugia for the studied orchid genus. The first one was located in the Madre de Dios region and the other one in the Mosquito Coast. The models suggest the existence of two migration routes of Trizeuxis species. The results indicate that the ecological niche modeling (ENM) is a useful tool for analyzing not only the possible past distribution of the species, but may be also applied to determine the migration routes of the organisms not found in the fossil material. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

Some of these countries have enforced strict quarantine rules and trade restrictions owing to concerns about the potential establishment and subsequent spread of western cherry fruit fly, Rhagoletis indifferens Curran (Diptera: Tephritidae), a major quarantine pest of sweet cherry. We used 1) niche models (CLIMEX and MaxEnt) to map the climatic suitability, 2) North Carolina State University-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Plant Pest Forecasting System to examine chilling requirement, and 3) host distribution and availability to assess the potential for establishment of R. indifferens in areas of western North America where it currently does not exist and eight current or potential fresh sweet cherry markets: Colombia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam. Results from niche models conformed well to the current distribution of R. indifferens in western North America. MaxEnt and CLIMEX models had high performance and predicted climatic suitability in some of the countries (e.g., Andean range in Colombia and Venezuela, northern and northeastern India, central Taiwan, and parts of Vietnam). However, our results showed no potential for establishment of R. indifferens in Colombia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam when the optimal chilling requirement to break diapause (minimum temperature ≤3°C for at least 15 wk) was used as the criterion for whether establishment can occur. Furthermore, these countries have no host plant species available for R. indifferens. Our results can be used to make scientifically informed international trade decisions and negotiations by policy makers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Entomological Society of America.},

We might expect them to be threatened by climate change, but their distributions within Iberia are poorly documented. In this study, we examine the climatic conditions that explain the distribution of Iberian bumblebees. Species distribution models (SDMs) were built using a presence-only technique (Maxent), incorporating presence data of Iberian bumblebees (initially 5795 records for 38 species) with seven climatic variables. We observed that: (i) mountain regions were highlighted as rich in species (bumblebee hot spots); (ii) rare species are climatic specialist species that mainly inhabit mountain regions; (iii) common species are more tolerant of a broader range of climates, notably of higher temperatures; (iv) some areas of Iberia are largely undersampled, including areas predicted to support high bumblebee diversity. We identify areas where targeted searches may reveal undiscovered populations of rare bumblebee species.

This paper introduces an automatic method for the classification of strong-weak (SW) and weak-strong (WS) stress patterns in children speech with American English accent, for use in the assessment of the speech dysprosody. We investigate the ability of two sets of features used to train classifiers to identify the variation in lexical stress between two consecutive syllables. The first set consists of traditional features derived from measurements of pitch, intensity and duration, whereas the second set consists of energies of different filter banks. Three different classifiers were used in the experiments: an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier with a single hidden layer, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with both linear and Gaussian kernels and the Maximum Entropy modeling (MaxEnt). these features. Best results were obtained using an ANN classifier and a combination of the two sets of features.

abstract = {No recent attempt has been made to survey dhole distribution, or to estimate remaining population numbers. We surveyed 15 protected areas in Thailand with camera traps from 1996 to 2010. We used the photo locations of dholes (n=96) in the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model along with six environmental variables to model current dhole distribution, as well as species predictive occurrence layers for sambar, red muntjac, wild boar, tiger, and leopard. The MaxEnt model identified the predicted probability of the presence of leopards and sambar as positive and the most important variables in modeling dhole presence, indicating that maintaining a sufficient prey base may be the most important factor determining continued survival of dholes. Roughly 7{\%} of the total land area in Thailand is potentially suitable for dholes. However, surveys to date have focused on protected areas, which make up just a third of the potential suitable areas for dholes. Only in four protected areas do they occur across the entire landscape, suggesting that in the majority of places where they occur, habitats are not uniformly suitable. Using the model, we identified several potential areas where dholes have not been reported, and therefore status surveys are needed, and where future research of the species might be focused. {\textcopyright} 2012 by Walter de Gruyter.Berlin.Boston.},

The species is frequently encountered in various types of habitats. We collected over 600 distributional records from available literature, museum collections, and our own field work and used bioclimatic and land cover characteristics to develop a model of potential distribution for M. watsonana. According to the model, the most important factors limiting the distribution of M. watsonana are: precipitation in wettest quarter exceeding 250-300 mm, precipitation in coldest quarter lower than 40 mm and exceeding 250 mm, altitudes above 2500 m and slopes steeper than 10.5°. The model suggests that most of the Iranian Plateau is suitable for the species except for some isolated areas such as the Dasht-e Kavir and Dasht-e Lut deserts in Iran, Helmand basin in Afghanistan, the Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan, the western Chagai-Kharan deserts of Pakistani Balochistan, and Thar and Cholistan deserts in eastern Pakistan. The most important factor in these regions appears to be the extremely low rainfall during coldest quarter of the year. The outer boundary of the distribution of M. watsonana follows important biogeographic barriers that are also clearly delimited by climatic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Nowadays, species are driven to extinction at a high rate. To reduce this rate it is important to delineate suitable habitats for these species in such a way that these areas can be suggested as conservation areas. The use of habitat suitability models (HSMs) can be of great importance for the delineation of such areas. In this study MaxEnt, a presence-only modelling technique, is used to develop HSMs for 223 nematode species of the Southern Bight of the North Sea. However, it is essential that these models are beyond discussion and they should be checked for potential errors. In this study we focused on two categories (1) errors which can be attributed to the database such as preferential sampling and spatial autocorrelation and (2) errors induced by the modelling technique such as overfitting, In order to quantify these adverse effects thousands of nulls models were created. The effect of preferential sampling (i.e. some areas where visited more frequenty than others) was investigated by comparing model outcomes based from null models sampling the actual sampling stations and null models sampling the entire mapping area (Raes and ter Steege, 2007). Overfitting is exposed by a fivefold cross-validation and the influence of spatial autocorrelation is assessed by separating test and training sets in space. Our results clearly show that all these effects are present: preferential sampling has a strong effect on the selection of non-random species models. Crossvalidation seems to have less influence on the model selection and spatial autocorrelation is also strongly present. It is clear from this study that predefined thresholds are not readily applicable to all datasets and additional tests are needed in model selection. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Many studies employ ecological niche models (ENMs) to predict species' occurrences in undersampled regions, generally without field confirmation. Here, we use field surveys to test the relative utility of four potential refinements to the standard ENM approach: 1) altering model complexity based on AIC{\textless}inf{\textgreater}c{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, 2) selecting background points from a biologically informed region, 3) using target-group background to account for sampling bias in existing localities, and 4) using many rangewide localities (global model) versus fewer proximal localities (local model) to construct geographically restricted range predictions. We used Maxent to predict new localities for the California tiger salamander Ambystoma californiense, an endangered species that often goes undocumented due to its cryptic lifestyle. We followed this with a field survey of 260 previously unsampled potential breeding sites in Solano County, CA and used the resulting presence/absence data to compare all factorial combinations of the four model refinements using a new application of the Kruskal-Wallis test for ENM outputs. Our field surveys led to the discovery of 81 previously undocumented breeding localities for the California tiger salamander and demonstrated that ENMs could be significantly improved by utilizing target-group background to account for spatial sampling bias and local models to focus model output on the subregion of the range being surveyed. Our results clearly demonstrate the potential for local models to outperform global models, and we recommend supplementing traditional Maxent global models that utilize all known localities with local models, particularly when species occupy geographically structured, heterogeneous habitat types. We also recommend using target-group background since the improvement we observed when including it in our models was significant and very similar to that documented by previous studies. Most importantly, we emphasize the importance of field verification to enable rigorous statistical comparisons among models. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

However, distributions have been restricted by pre-war hunting, and populations are facing issues of natural forest losses caused by new dam constructions and massive conifer plantations. In the present study, we predicted the influences of these environmental conditions on macaque habitats during each season, and evaluated the effect of natural forest restoration as a mitigation measure. We constructed multiple habitat suitability models on the basis of different forest change scenarios, by using maximum entropy modeling (Maxent). We predicted the influence of each scenario by calculating the habitat unit (habitat quality×habitat quantity). We made the following predictions: (1) the influences of environmental conditions on habitat models vary seasonally, but dam construction destroys the optimum macaque habitats in every season; (2) restoration of conifer plantations to semi-natural forests does not always contribute to the improvement of total habitat unit, except in snowy seasons; and (3) in comparison with encouraging natural forest restoration in plantation areas and maintaining the standard-rotation plantation management, the implementation of long-rotation plantation in existing plantation areas provides more suitable alternative habitats for macaques in non-snowy seasons.

Using a geographical information system and ecological niche-based modelling tools, this study combines high resolution presence data from 22 mammals and environmental factors from the West Sahara-Sahel to identify suitable areas for mammal occurrence, biogeographic affinities among taxa, and local hotspots of species richness. The maximum entropy approach was used to relate environmental factors with mammal distributions and to predict suitable areas of species' occurrence. Biogeographic groups were defined based on the spatial similarities of predicted distributions. Ecological niches of analysed taxa were summarized through Principal Components Analyses based on topoclimatic and habitat variables. Distributions of most mammals were related with climate and/or habitat features, and some were associated with topography. Suitable areas were predicted mostly within known distributions of mammalian taxa. Low values of niche breadth were estimated for all taxa, indicating a tendency for specialization in the study area. Shared distributional ranges among taxa allowed the identification of five groups with different biogeographic affinities. Most groups occurred in the ecoregions North Saharan steppe and woodlands and Sahelian Acacia savanna, reflecting their availability and stressing the importance of these ecoregions for local mammal conservation. Predicted suitable areas were poorly represented in the current network of protected areas, especially in Mauritania. The southern Mauritanian mountains contained suitable habitat for most of the studies mammals, but are largely unprotected. The fine scale ecological niche-based models built with high resolution data can be used to identify key-areas for conservation and management, and could be applied to other remote regions and taxonomic groups worldwide. {\textcopyright} 2016 Associazione Teriologica Italiana.},

We used Maxent to model the current and future climatically suitable habitat for two dominant sagebrush species in the study area, and we used a degree-day model to predict future West Nile virus transmission risk under likely climate-change scenarios. Our models suggest that areas with the highest future suitability for sagebrush habitat will be found in southwestern Wyoming and north-central Montana.

abstract = {It is unclear how the environmental heterogeneity of the prairie biome of North America contributes to the biogeographic ranges of vascular plant species, particularly herbaceous taxa. We examined the spatial distributions of 30 abundant plant species of the grasslands of North America distributed among four functional groups: C4 grasses, C3 grasses, forbs, and woody species. For each species, we mapped its distribution using occurrence data from georeferenced herbarium specimens and a species distribution model (MAXENT). We then assessed which of several climate, soil, and elevation variables contribute to determining its range. On average, these 30 plant species are distributed over large areas, with an average range size of 1,989,750 km2. Temperature variables contribute the most to the MAXENT model for 27 of the 30 species. Size of range, abruptness of boundary edges, and location of range vary among all 30 species. Functional groups differ primarily in range size and the centroid of the ranges. Conservation of tallgrass, mixed-grass, and shortgrass prairie biomes will require a flexible strategy with widely distributed habitat over the Great Plains along both north-south and east-west gradients.},

abstract = {Aim: Predicting extinctions before they are realized has proven difficult, yet is increasingly important for biodiversity conservation as habitat destruction continues unabated around the world. We evaluated whether habitat suitability models can be used in conjunction with species-area relationships (SAR) to detect apparent extinction debts as implicated by the conservation status assigned to bird species. Location: KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. Methods: We modelled historic distributions of coastal forests using MaxEnt, a presence-only technique for modelling species distributions. The model provided an estimate of forest loss. We then conducted 293 point counts to survey birds within remaining forest fragments and employed an information-theoretic framework to test for the best fit SAR model. Extinction debts were calculated using the estimate of forest loss and the empirical SAR data. Results: Our model suggests extensive forest loss (82{\%}) within a naturally fragmented landscape. The power function provided the best fit for bird SAR. Fourteen bird species are predicted to go extinct from coastal forests. Predicted extinctions closely matched the number of threatened species locally but not globally. Predicted extinctions also only matched globally threatened species that reach their northernmost distribution limit within coastal forests, but not species that reach their southernmost distribution limit here. Main conclusions: We found that habitat suitability models could be used in conjunction with SAR to estimate extinction debt implied by conservation statuses of extant species. Our approach assumed that forest loss drives extinction debts but also provided the opportunity to link forest loss and the likelihood of extinction. Models of historical forest distribution may provide guidelines of where to implement restoration actions. Maintaining matrix habitats that link forest fragments and targeted landscape level restoration that increases fragment area and link isolated fragments will be important to prevent predicted extinctions. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) use the locations of collection records to map the distributions of species, making them a powerful tool in conservation biology, ecology and biogeography. However, the accuracy of range predictions may be reduced by temporally autocorrelated biases in the data. We assess the accuracy of SDMs in predicting the ranges of tropical plant species on the basis of different sample sizes while incorporating real-world collection patterns and biases. Location Tropical South American moist forests. Methods We use dated herbarium records to model the distributions of 65 Amazonian and Andean plant species. For each species, we use the first 25, 50, 100, 125 and 150 records collected and available for each species to analyse changes in spatial aggregation and climatic representativeness through time. We compare the accuracy of SDM range estimates produced using the time-ordered data subsets to the accuracy of range estimates generated using the same number of collections but randomly subsampled from all available records. Results We find that collections become increasingly aggregated through time but that additional collecting sites are added resulting in progressively better representations of the species' full climatic niches. The range predictions produced using time-ordered data subsets are less accurate than predictions from random subsets of equal sample sizes. Range predictions produced using time-ordered data subsets consistently underestimate the extent of ranges while no such tendency exists for range predictions produced using random data subsets. Main conclusions These results suggest that larger sample sizes are required to accurately map species ranges. Additional attention should be given to increasing the number of records available per species through continued collecting, better distributed collecting, and/or increasing access to existing collections. The fact that SDMs generally under-predict the extent of species ranges means that extinction risks of species because of future habitat loss may be lower than previously estimated. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim: Interest in species distribution models (SDMs) and related niche studies has increased dramatically in recent years, with several books and reviews being prepared since 2000. The earliest SDM studies are dealt with only briefly even in the books. Consequently, many researchers are unaware of when the first SDM software package (bioclim) was developed and how a broad range of applications using the package was explored within the first 8 years following its release. The purpose of this study is to clarify these early developments and initial applications, as well as to highlight bioclim's continuing relevance to current studies. Location: Mainly Australia and New Zealand, but also some global applications. Methods: We outline the development of the bioclim package, early applications (1984-1991) and its current relevance. Results: bioclim was the first SDM package to be widely used. Early applications explored many of the possible uses of SDMs in conservation biogeography, such as quantifying the environmental niche of species, identifying areas where a species might be invasive, assisting conservation planning and assessing the likely impacts of climate change on species distributions. Main conclusions: Understanding this pioneering work is worthwhile as bioclim was for many years one of the leading SDM packages and remains widely used. Climate interpolation methods developed for bioclim were used to create the WorldClim database, the most common source of climate data for SDM studies, and bioclim variables are used in about 76{\%} of recent published MaxEnt analyses of terrestrial ecosystems. Also, some of the bioclim studies from the late 1980s, such as measuring niche (both realized and fundamental) and assessing possible impacts of climate change, are still highly relevant to key conservation biogeography issues. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

Identifying high quality areas in the landscape is critical for mounting efficient conservation programs for these primates. We constructed ecological niche models (ENMs) for GHLTs and Wied's marmosets using the presence-only algorithm Maxent to (1) locate suitable areas for each species, (2) examine the overlap in these areas, and (3) determine the amount of suitable habitat in protected areas. Our models indicate that 36{\%} (10, 659 km2) of the study area is suitable for GHLTs and 53{\%} (15, 642 km2) for Wied's marmosets. Suitable areas were strongly defined by presence of neighboring forest cover for both species, as well as annual temperature range for GHLTs and distance from urban areas for Wied's marmosets. Thirty-three percent of the landscape (9,809 km2) is overlapping suitable habitat. Given that the focal species form mixed-species groups, these areas of shared suitability may be key locations for preserving this important behavioral interaction. Protected areas contained 6{\%} (651 km2) of all suitable habitat for GHLTs and 4{\%} (682 km2) for Wied's marmosets. All protected areas were suitable for the focal species, excepting Serra do Conduru, which had low suitability for GHLTs. Our results highlight that suitable habitat for GHLTs and Wied's marmosets is limited and largely unprotected. Conservation action to protect additional suitable areas will be critical for their persistence. {\textcopyright} 2016, Mongaby.com e-journal. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The clear need for accurate landslide susceptibility mapping has led to multiple approaches. Physical models are easily interpreted and have high predictive capabilities but rely on spatially explicit and accurate parameterization, which is commonly not possible. Statistical methods can include other factors influencing slope stability such as distance to roads, but rely on good landslide inventories. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model has been widely and successfully used in species distribution mapping, because data on absence are often uncertain. Similarly, knowledge about the absence of landslides is often limited due to mapping scale or methodology. In this paper a hybrid approach is described that combines the physically-based landslide susceptibility model "Stability INdex MAPping" (SINMAP) with MaxEnt. This method is tested in a coastal watershed in Pacifica, CA, USA, with a well-documented landslide history including 3 inventories of 154 scars on 1941 imagery, 142 in 1975, and 253 in 1983. Results indicate that SINMAP alone overestimated susceptibility due to insufficient data on root cohesion. Models were compared using SINMAP stability index (SI) or slope alone, and SI or slope in combination with other environmental factors: curvature, a 50-m trail buffer, vegetation, and geology. For 1941 and 1975, using slope alone was similar to using SI alone; however in 1983 SI alone creates an Areas Under the receiver operator Curve (AUC) of 0.785, compared with 0.749 for slope alone. In maximum-entropy models created using all environmental factors, the stability index (SI) from SINMAP represented the greatest contributions in all three years (1941: 48.1{\%}; 1975: 35.3; and 1983: 48{\%}), with AUC of 0.795, 0822, and 0.859, respectively; however; using slope instead of SI created similar overall AUC values, likely due to the combined effect with plan curvature indicating focused hydrologic inputs and vegetation identifying the effect of root cohesion. The combined approach-using either stability index or slope-highlights the importance of additional environmental variables in modeling landslide initiation. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the authors.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to provide a general overview on random matrix ensembles for modeling stochastic elasticity tensors that exhibit uncertainties on material symmetries. Such an issue is of primal importance in many practical situations involving either a computational or experimental analysis on random heterogeneous materials (such as bones, reinforced composites, etc.). For this purpose, we first define a stochastic measure of anisotropy, the definition of which relies on the use of distances in the set of fourth-order elasticity tensors. We subsequently describe two random matrix ensembles that have been proposed within the framework of information theory and making use of a MaxEnt approach. In particular, we discuss the relevance of each of those with respect to constraints on the proposed anisotropy measure. It is shown that the capability of prescribing the mean distance to a given symmetry class depends, in view of the eigensystem-based characterization, on the behavior of the random eigenvalues. Finally, we propose a procedure allowing for the identification of the stochastic representation, should a set of experimental data be available. The approach, which is based on the use of the maximum likelihood principle, is exemplified in the case of experimental realizations that are almost transversely isotropic. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The scarcity of distributional records in vast regions such as the Amazon impedes understanding of fish distribution. Predictive distribution models have emerged as a better alternative to surpass this problem, but the absence of large-scale maps for aquatic variables has been suggested as an important limitation. We aimed to evaluate the use of macroclimatic variables as surrogates for local limnological variables in the Brazilian Amazon. Ordinary least squares model were used to predict the local habitat variables from climatic and geomorphological information as macroscale variables. Models for six stream-dwelling fish were built in MaxEnt and validated using area under curve and true skill statistics (TSS). All local variables were predicted successfully (R2 {\textgreater} 0.39), and MaxEnt models had good suitability using the macroscale variables (TSS higher than 0.70). We conclude that macroscale variables can be effective surrogates for local habitat variables, at least for large-scale analyses on poorly sampled regions such as the Brazilian Amazon. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

Nuisance blooms of D geminata affect the diversity, abundance, and productivity of other aquatic organisms. Because D geminata can be transported by humans on waders and other gear, accurate spatial prediction of habitat suitability is urgently needed for early detection and rapid response, as well as for evaluation of monitoring and control programs. We compared four modeling methods to predict D geminata's habitat distribution; two methods use presence-absence data (logistic regression and classification and regression tree [CART]), and two involve presence data (maximum entropy model [Maxent] and genetic algorithm for rule-set production [GARP]). Using these methods, we evaluated spatially explicit, bioclimatic and environmental variables as predictors of diatom distribution. The Maxent model provided the most accurate predictions, followed by logistic regression, CART, and GARP. The most suitable habitats were predicted to occur in the western US, in relatively cool sites, and at high elevations with a high base-flow index. The results provide insights into the factors that affect the distribution of D geminata and a spatial basis for the prediction of nuisance blooms. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

Model development included measuring erosion rates, application of a quantitative approach to locate Target Eroding Areas (TEAs), and creation of maps of boundary conditions. We successfully constructed a probability distribution of TEAs using the program Maxent. All model evaluation procedures indicated that the model was an excellent predictor, and that the major environmental variables controlling these processes were streambank slope, soil characteristics, bank position, and underlying geology. A classification scheme with low, moderate, and high levels of SEP derived from logistic model output was able to differentiate sites with low erosion potential from sites with moderate and high erosion potential.

abstract = {Summary: In Mediterranean mountainous areas, forests have expanded in recent decades because traditional management practices have been abandoned or reduced. However, understanding the ecological mechanisms behind landscape change is a complex undertaking because the influence of land use may be reinforced or constrained by abiotic factors such as climate. In this work, we evaluated their combined effects on recent forest expansion across climatic, topographic and management gradients. We used orthorectified aerial photographs from the second half of the twentieth century (1956, 1974, 1983, 1990 and 2004) to monitor changes in forest distribution in a set of 20 head-water basins in the Cantabrian Mountains of north-west Spain, at the Eurosiberian-Mediterranean limit. In particular, we evaluated the role of land-use history (comparing natural vs. anthropic basins) and microclimate (comparing shaded vs. sunny aspects) of forest gain/loss rates and spatial distribution shifts. Finally, we applied Species Distribution Modelling techniques (MaxEnt and BIOMOD) in the stated scenarios of land-use history and microclimate, to assess habitat suitability for forest expansion on the basis of topography, soil properties and mesoclimatic variables. Forest cover increased from 10.72{\%} in 1956 to 27.67{\%} in 2004 in the area. The rate of expansion was significantly higher in natural basins and, particularly, on shaded slopes. In all cases, the mean elevation of new forest patches increased during the study period, which was particularly evident on natural sunny slopes. The performance of the models and the magnitude of the effects varied across land-use histories and microclimatic conditions. Soil properties and temperature and precipitation in late spring and early summer were the main drivers of forest expansion in modelling exercises, although expansion rates and upward altitudinal shifts were primarily controlled by land-use history and the biogeographic origin of the forests. Synthesis. The combination of monitoring and modelling techniques used in this work contributed to the understanding of forest expansion in cultural systems, indicating that ecological succession is not a homogeneous process, but varies spatially due to human and abiotic constraints since historical times. {\textcopyright} 2014 British Ecological Society.},

Despite the international interest for these procedures, applications of predictive approaches to the study of Italian fauna distribution are exceptionally rare. This paper aimed at: (a) detecting climatic exigencies of A. bedriagae in Sardinia; (b) predicting the Archaeolacerta bedriagae Sardinian potential distribution; (c) identifying the most vulnerable Italian populations of the species. Literature and field data were utilized as presence records. Six modelling procedures (BIOCLIM, DOMAIN, ENFA, GAM, GLM, and MAXENT) were adopted. The species climatic requirements were defined using the WorldClim databank for deriving the environmental predictors. AUC and Kappa values were calculated for models validation. AUC values were compared by using Anova Monte Carlo. The best four models were combined through the weighted average consensus method for producing a univocal output. GAM and MAXENT had the best performances (respectively: AUC = 0.93 ± 0.03, Kappa = 0.77 ± 0.08; AUC = 0.93 ± 0.03, Kappa = 0.78 ± 0.07).

In Sardinia A. bedriagae is mainly influenced by seasonality, which causes the evidenced range fragmentation. Moreover, the general importance of multi-methods approaches and consensus techniques in predicting species distribution was highlighted. {\textcopyright} 2009 Brill Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {The impact of climate change on ecosystems, especially at the species level, is already being observed across the world. To assess potential future climate change effects on species, scientists often use species distribution modelling (SDM). The estimation of likely changes in the distribution of species under future climate conditions is a crucial first step towards the mitigation and management of future species losses or habitat shifts. Considering this, the aim of the present study is to predict the effect of climate change on a valuable threatened tree species, Mangifera sylvatica Roxb., of Bangladesh using Maximum Entropy. The current potential distribution as by the model suggests that around 5{\%} of the study area is highly suitable wild mango habitat, with between 6{\%} and 11{\%} being moderately suitable. Under the RCP 4.5 scenario, the net decrease in suitable habitat is predicted to be 7{\%} by 2070. Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the model predicts that the total area suitable for mango will reduce by 12{\%} by 2050, disappearing altogether by 2070. Therefore, urgent measures are required for the conservation of M. sylvatica in Bangladesh. The application of the species distribution model may provide policymakers and conservationists with a useful tool for the prediction of future distribution (at both local and regional scales); of poorly known species with high preservation concerns. The approach used in this study can provide a rapid assessment of the future conservation status of other important forest tree species in Bangladesh to improve our understanding of the vulnerability under changing climate. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {To conserve habitat for disturbance specialist species, ecologists must identify where individuals will likely settle in newly disturbed areas. Habitat suitability models can predict which sites at new disturbances will most likely attract specialists. Without validation data from newly disturbed areas, however, the best approach for maximizing predictive accuracy can be unclear (Northwestern U.S.A.). We predicted habitat suitability for nesting Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus; a burned-forest specialist) at 20 recently (≤6 years postwildfire) burned locations in Montana using models calibrated with data from three locations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. We developed 8 models using three techniques (weighted logistic regression, Maxent, and Mahalanobis D2 models) and various combinations of four environmental variables describing burn severity, the north-south orientation of topographic slope, and prefire canopy cover. After translating model predictions into binary classifications (0 = low suitability to unsuitable, 1 = high to moderate suitability), we compiled "ensemble predictions," consisting of the number of models (0-8) predicting any given site as highly suitable. The suitability status for 40{\%} of the area burned by eastside Montana wildfires was consistent across models and therefore robust to uncertainty in the relative accuracy of particular models and in alternative ecological hypotheses they described. Ensemble predictions exhibited two desirable properties: (1) a positive relationship with apparent rates of nest occurrence at calibration locations and (2) declining model agreement outside surveyed environments consistent with our reduced confidence in novel (i.e., "no-analogue") environments. Areas of disagreement among models suggested where future surveys could help validate and refine models for an improved understanding of Black-backed Woodpecker nesting habitat relationships. Ensemble predictions presented here can help guide managers attempting to balance salvage logging with habitat conservation in burned-forest landscapes where black-backed woodpecker nest location data are not immediately available. Ensemble modeling represents a promising tool for guiding conservation of large-scale disturbance specialists. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

The ABM is supported by a longitudinal social survey of nearly 10,000 households, a deep satellite image time-series of land use change trajectories, multi-thematic social and ecological data organized within a GIS, and a suite of software modules that integrate data derived from an agricultural cropping system model (DSSAT - Decision Support for Agrotechnology Transfer) and a land suitability model (MAXENT - Maximum Entropy), in addition to multi-dimensional demographic survey data of individuals and households.The primary modules of the ABM are the Initialization Module, Migration Module, Assets Module, Land Suitability Module, Crop Yield Module, Fertilizer Module, and the Land Use Change Decision Module. The architecture of the ABM is described relative to module function and connectivity through uni-directional or bi-directional links. In general, the Social Modules simulate changes in human population and social networks, as well as changes in population migration and household assets, whereas the Land Use Modules simulate changes in land use types, land suitability, and crop yields. We emphasize the description of the Land Use Modules - the algorithms and interactions between the modules are described relative to the project goals of assessing household income and wealth relative to shifts in land use patterns, household demographics, population migration, social networks, and agricultural activities that collectively occur within a marginalized environment that is subjected to a suite of endogenous and exogenous dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Faidherbia albida (Delile) A. Chev. is a species of both economic and ecological importance. We use 229 locational records gathered in the dry highlands of Ethiopia, nineteen environmental variables and the modelling program MaxEnt to model both the present and possible future distributions of this species. To model future distributions, we used two emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6 and 8.5) for two time slices (2050 and 2070). Mean temperature of wettest quarter was the major factor which determines the species' potential distribution. Suitable habitat for F. albida under the current climatic conditions is the mid-highlands. However, its future distributions would shift upwards in elevation and will likely lead to some decrease in suitable areas, especially towards the end of the century. At the same time, however, other areas would become suitable for colonization, so that, overall, the species does not appear to face a significant reduction in distribution within our study region. Future studies should consider the possible effects of climate extremes, further environmental factors and of evolutionary adaptation of the species to new conditions. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly widespread in the conservation literature. They can be used for a variety of purposes, including addressing practical conservation tasks on the basis of a spatially explicit assessment of environmental suitability for target taxa, which in turn allows for a transparent evaluation of needs and opportunities. Here we used the maximum entropy method (by means of the software MaxEnt) to model distribution of the rare Boreal Owl Aegolius funereus and the Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius, which excavates the nest-holes used by the owl for breeding. We believe that monitoring surveys for Boreal Owl should consider areas suitable for both species as priority sites, whereas the provision of nest-boxes for the owl may be particularly desirable in habitat patches that are suitable for that species but not for the keystone species whose nest-holes represent the usual nest site for the owl. Finally, areas suitable for both species can represent priority areas for the conservation of forest birds in the Alps, as both species have been reported as umbrella and/or keystone species. Our example provides a possible framework to model management and monitoring opportunities in other species or species pairs, but such an approach can be used to infer the need for particular management options when both limiting factors and species distribution can be spatially modelled, and also to model the areas where different target species are more likely to overlap and interact. The use of distribution models as tools to address practical conservation tasks should also be encouraged in order to accomplish practical tasks according to sound knowledge and transparent methods. {\textcopyright} BirdLife International 2013.},

This study uses ecological niche modeling techniques to estimate dimensions of realized niches of coelacanths and generate hypotheses for additional sites where they might be found. Coelacanth occurrence information was integrated with environmental and oceanographic data using the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production (GARP) and a maximum entropy algorithm (Maxent). Resulting models were visualized as maps of relative suitability of sites for coelacanths throughout the Indian Ocean, as well as scatterplots of ecological variables. Our findings suggest that the range of coelacanths could extend beyond their presently known distribution and suggests alternative mechanisms for currently observed distributions. Further investigation into these hypotheses could aid in forming a more complete picture of the distributions and populations of members of genus Latimeria, which in turn could aid in developing conservation strategies, particularly in the case of L. menadoensis. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The Glycine (Leguminosae) allopolyploid complex affords the opportunity to test whether polyploidy in similar genetic backgrounds produces similar effects on geographical range or climatic space. • Methods: We used information on locality presence of four closely related Glycine allopolyploid species and their diploid progenitors to build models of the potentially available Australian ranges based on climate using Maxent3.3.3k. Principal coordinate analysis was used to characterize the multidimensional climate space occupied by each species. • Key results: Each of the four Glycine allopolyploids showed intermediacy in potential geographical space and in ecological space, relative to its diploid progenitors. The four allopolyploids did not have consistently larger ranges than their progenitors, though all four occupied a portion of climate niche space not available to its progenitors. The polyploids also differed in their exploitation of potentially available geographical range. Australian ranges and environmental space did not correlate with greater colonizing ability in these polyploids. • Conclusions: The four Glycine allopolyploids do not show many common range- or climate-related features, other than intermediacy. Thus, despite their similar genetic and evolutionary backgrounds, polyploidy has not produced convergent ecological effects. {\textcopyright} 2014 Botanical Society of America.},

A niche model based on the maximum entropy method (MaxEnt) was used to estimate the influence of meteorological and geographical factors on the observed spatial distribution of F. hepatica infestation. Results of jackknife analysis indicated that temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, digital elevation and slope were associated with the occurrence of F. hepatica infestation, and that infestation rates were significantly higher among animals from districts with a high percentage of grassland habitat.

abstract = {Background: Aedes albopictus and Ae. japonicus are two of the most widespread invasive mosquito species that have recently become established in western Europe. Both species are associated with the transmission of a number of serious diseases and are projected to continue their spread in Europe. Methods: In the present study, we modelled the habitat suitability for both species under current and future climatic conditions by means of an Ensemble forecasting approach. We additionally compared the modelled MAXENT niches of Ae. albopictus and Ae. japonicus regarding temperature and precipitation requirements. Results: Both species were modelled to find suitable habitat conditions in distinct areas within Europe: Ae. albopictus within the Mediterranean regions in southern Europe, Ae. japonicus within the more temperate regions of central Europe. Only in few regions, suitable habitat conditions were projected to overlap for both species. Whereas Ae. albopictus is projected to be generally promoted by climate change in Europe, the area modelled to be climatically suitable for Ae. japonicus is projected to decrease under climate change. This projection of range reduction under climate change relies on the assumption that Ae. japonicus is not able to adapt to warmer climatic conditions. The modelled MAXENT temperature niches of Ae. japonicus were found to be narrower with an optimum at lower temperatures compared to the niches of Ae. albopictus. Conclusions: Species distribution models identifying areas with high habitat suitability can help improving monitoring programmes for invasive species currently in place. However, as mosquito species are known to be able to adapt to new environmental conditions within the invasion range quickly, niche evolution of invasive mosquito species should be closely followed upon in future studies. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s).},

Accurate estimates of species distributions are needed to assess the impacts of anthropogenic actions and for exploring evolutionary and ecological processes that maintain biological diversity. After documenting several extralimital locations for Black-fronted Ground-Tyrants (Muscisaxicola frontalis; Tyrannidae), we questioned the accuracy of the current winter range estimate. We provide specimen and observation records from central and southern Peru that represent new information about the winter distribution of Black-fronted Ground-Tyrants. We used ecological niche models generated from new extralimital records and records from the winter range to assess the current range estimate. We also tested winter and extralimital niche models for model equivalency using a resampling technique available through Maxent and ENM Tools. Niche models developed with locations from the winter range predicted with high probability ({\textgreater}90{\%}) the area of the extralimital records. Reciprocally, niche models developed with the extralimital locations predicted the majority of the winter range locations, although the probability was lower for some locations and the most southerly points were not included in the prediction. The test for model equivalency did not distinguish the two models, suggesting the possibility that the extralimital records were from poorly sampled areas of the true winter range. Smaller scale habitat associations of Black-fronted Ground-Tyrants, such as a preference for sparsely vegetated slopes, were documented that were more specific than published accounts. Finally, we present the first case of frugivory in Muscisaxicola with the identification of Cumulopuntia boliviana ignescens (Cactaceae) seeds and pericarp in all five stomach samples of Black-fronted Ground-Tyrants collected in southern Peru. {\textcopyright} 2011 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract = {Predicting the potential distribution of invasive plants within a specific region is pivotal to planning effective management but is challenged by attempting to model expanding populations that are rarely at equilibrium with their environment. We adopt an ensemble modelling approach to assess the potential distribution of Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), a vine invasive to forests of the Cumberland Plateau and Mountain Region in the southeast of USA. The influence of disturbance, spatial and temporal heterogeneity and other landscape characteristics were assessed by creating regional level models based on occurrence records from the United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database. Logistic regression and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models were assessed independently and evaluated as predictive tools to test the value of presence/absence and presence only data in predicting species distributions. Ensemble models were also developed that combined the predictions of the two modelling approaches to obtain a more robust prediction. While logistic and MaxEnt models were similar in their predictive ability and dominant input variables, the ensemble approach derived the best fitting model overall. The regional distribution of Japanese honeysuckle was influenced greatly by environmental conditions such as elevation, slope, and temperature with anthropogenic activity having significant, though lesser, influence. The ensemble models predict that Japanese honeysuckle has nearly reached its potential distribution. However, given the critical role of minimum temperature on Japanese honeysuckle distribution, future occupancy at higher elevations is likely to increase since January temperatures for this region are predicted to rise by 1-4. °C over the next 100 years. The models also give some indication of the likely effect of land cover change on its distribution. Japanese honeysuckle tended to be associated with a high component of farming or low component of forest within the local neighbourhood. This suggests disturbed forest and/or high fragmentation has a higher invasion potential and given past trends and expected continued population growth this disturbance and fragmentation will only increase. The models can be integrated into forest management decision support systems and assist in the development of long term management plans, integrating the impact of potential climate and land cover change scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Using existing distribution data, land-use/land cover, elevation and bio-climatic variables, we modeled the likely distribution of Asian elephant and Hoolock gibbon in Bangladesh for 2050 and 2070. We used the IPCC's Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) - RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 and Maximum Entropy algorithm for our modelling. Our study indicated that the Asian elephant will be more resilient to climate change compared with the Hoolock gibbon. Habitat loss for the Asian elephant is also expected to remain constant (i.e. 38{\%}) throughout the period, whilst Hoolock gibbon habitat will be more sensitive to climatic variations, with the species predicted to be extirpated from the country by 2070. Being highly exposed to climate change with ever increasing land use pressures, we believe our study in Bangladesh can be used to enhance our understanding of future vulnerabilities of wildlife in a rapidly changing climate.

However, data of plant species distribution are often scarce and modeling of habitat distribution using commonly used models is difficult. In this study, the Maximum Entropy Method (Max-Ent) was used to model the distribution of plant habitat to find the effective variables in plant species occurrence in the Poshtkouh rangelands on Yazd province, central Iran. Maps of the environ-mental variables were generated using GIS and Geostatistics facilities. Accuracy of model output was assessed using area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic and keeping 30 percent of the data. Evaluation of model accuracy by AUC indicated good and acceptable predictive accuracy for all plant species habitats, except Artemisia sieberi which had high frequency. The predictive maps of Artemisia aucheri, Scariola orientalis - Astragalus albispinus, A. sieberi2 and A. sieberi - Zygophyllum eurypterum had fair agreement with their corresponding observed maps. In addition, the accuracy of S. orientalis - A. sieberi and Tamarix ramosissima predictive maps was low and the estimated conformity rate of prediction and observed maps was poor. In fact, due to differences in the optimal ecological range, level of agreement of predictive and observed maps at each site was different. MaxEnt was substantially excellent to predict distributions of plant species habitat with narrow ecological niches e.g. Rheum ribes - A. sieberi, Seidlitzia rosmarinus and Cornulaca monacantha. It can also perform well with fairly few samples due to employing regularization. {\textcopyright} 2016, Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Psoroptic mange in sheep, resulting from infestation by the astigmatid mite Psoroptes ovis, is increasingly prevalent in Europe and other parts of the world. As a step towards improved national control, regional or local scab management programmes that target high-risk areas and aim to maintain the number of outbreaks below an acceptable level may be an effective initial use of time and resource. To facilitate such a management approach, in this paper scab outbreak farms are identified using a questionnaire survey of sheep farmers, the data from which are then used to build a national scab risk model for Great Britain. The questionnaire results indicate a national prevalence of scab, between March 2007 and February 2008, of 8.6{\%} (±1.98). However, previous exposure to sheep scab significantly affected the respondent's probability of reporting a scab outbreak during the survey period ($\chi$2 = 53.2, d.f. = 1, P {\textless} 0.001); 85{\%} of the farms that reported at least one scab outbreak had experienced outbreaks in previous years, 27{\%} had experienced outbreaks in more than five of the previous 10 years. In contrast, 76{\%} of farms that did not report scab had not had a previous outbreak. The highest prevalence areas were in Northern England, Wales, Southwest England and Scotland. Modelling the distribution of the reported scab outbreaks identified height above sea level, temperature and rainfall as significant predictors of the probability of an outbreak, superimposed on an underlying pattern of sheep abundance. It is argued that scab management programmes directed at these foci have the potential to allow a more targeted approach to scab control and significantly reduce the prevalence of scab in the UK and other European countries. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The alien invasive anuran Eleutherodactylus coqui is presently distributed in many Caribbean islands and Hawaiian Islands where it causes major ecological and socioeconomic problems, especially evident in the later. Here, I use a maximum entropy ecological niche modeling approach to model the native geographic distribution of this species and to project that model into other potentially threatened areas. The projection results under current climatic conditions suggested high probabilities of occurrence in tropical regions including the Caribbean, Florida, major parts of the Amazon basin and adjacent Andes, the Pantepui region, the Congo basin, and most Asian islands. Projections of potential distributions under future anthropogenic global warming scenarios within the Hawaiian Islands suggest an overall stable potential distribution, but fine scale patterns suggest a possible range allocation towards higher elevations which may affect natural reserves. If the predictive maps are interpreted as depicting invasiveness potential of E. coqui, strategies to prevent further invasion should focus on biosafety measurements within the areas highlighted. {\textcopyright} NwjZ, Oradea, Romania, 2009.},

abstract = {Recently, interest in species distribution modelling has increased following the development of new methods for the analysis of presence-only data and the deployment of these methods in user-friendly and powerful computer programs. However, reliable inference from these powerful tools requires that several assumptions be met, including the assumptions that observed presences are the consequence of random or representative sampling and that detectability during sampling does not vary with the covariates that determine occurrence probability. Based on our interactions with researchers using these tools, we hypothesized that many presence-only studies were ignoring important assumptions of presence-only modelling. We tested this hypothesis by reviewing 108 articles published between 2008 and 2012 that used the MAXENT algorithm to analyse empirical (i.e. not simulated) data. We chose to focus on these articles because MAXENT has been the most popular algorithm in recent years for analysing presence-only data. Many articles (87{\%}) were based on data that were likely to suffer from sample selection bias; however, methods to control for sample selection bias were rarely used. In addition, many analyses (36{\%}) discarded absence information by analysing presence-absence data in a presence-only framework, and few articles (14{\%}) mentioned detection probability. We conclude that there are many misconceptions concerning the use of presence-only models, including the misunderstanding that MAXENT, and other presence-only methods, relieve users from the constraints of survey design. In the process of our literature review, we became aware of other factors that raised concerns about the validity of study conclusions. In particular, we observed that 83{\%} of articles studies focused exclusively on model output (i.e. maps) without providing readers with any means to critically examine modelled relationships and that MAXENT's logistic output was frequently (54{\%} of articles) and incorrectly interpreted as occurrence probability. We conclude with a series of recommendations foremost that researchers analyse data in a presence-absence framework whenever possible, because fewer assumptions are required and inferences can be made about clearly defined parameters such as occurrence probability. {\textcopyright} 2012 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Buffelgrass, a highly competitive and flammable African bunchgrass, is spreading rapidly across both urban and natural areas in the Sonoran Desert of southern and central Arizona. Damages include increased fire risk, losses in biodiversity, and diminished revenues and quality of life. Feasibility of sustained and successful mitigation will depend heavily on rates of spread, treatment capacity, and cost-benefit analysis. We created a decision support model for the wildland-urban interface north of Tucson, AZ, using a spatial state-and-transition simulation modeling framework, the Tool for Exploratory Landscape Scenario Analyses. We addressed the issues of undetected invasions, identifying potentially suitable habitat and calibrating spread rates, while answering questions about how to allocate resources among inventory, treatment, and maintenance. Inputs to the model include a state-and-transition simulation model to describe the succession and control of buffelgrass, a habitat suitability model, management planning zones, spread vectors, estimated dispersal kernels for buffelgrass, and maps of current distribution. Our spatial simulations showed that without treatment, buffelgrass infestations that started with as little as 80 ha (198 ac) could grow to more than 6,000 ha by the year 2060. In contrast, applying unlimited management resources could limit 2060 infestation levels to approximately 50 ha. The application of sufficient resources toward inventory is important because undetected patches of buffelgrass will tend to grow exponentially. In our simulations, areas affected by buffelgrass may increase substantially over the next 50 yr, but a large, upfront investment in buffelgrass control could reduce the infested area and overall management costs. {\textcopyright} 2013 Weed Science Society of America.},

abstract = {Bioclimatic models assume that species distributions reflect their sensitivity to macroclimate, the so-called bioclimatic equilibrium. This has proven to be a controversial assumption. Here we perform a new test in the hypothesis of climatic equilibrium by comparing species' bioclimatic space between two independently derived spatial distributions in Britain and North America. A presence-only statistical model (MAXENT) was used to construct bioclimatic response surfaces for 25 lichens in North America. These models were then projected onto British climate space. We tested the following: (1) the statistical congruence between likelihood values for North American bioclimatic space projected onto Britain and species' observed British distributions, and (2) the extent to which the projection for a species matched its observed British distribution pattern better than the distributions for an alternative suite of species. In general, there is good evidence for bioclimatic equilibrium when comparing species distributions in North America and Britain. However, bioclimatic test 1 (statistical congruence) and bioclimatic test 2 (spatial matching) were failed by six (24{\%} of cases) and four (16{\%} of cases) species, respectively. Although there is general support for bioclimatic modelling in lichens, the species that failed a test of equilibrium would have been difficult to predict based on prior knowledge; however it may be explained by taxonomic uncertainty and (or) the existence of multiple correlated environmental drivers.},

Some are endemic and rare but are not yet protected by the Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 (Environmental protection-Native species of flora and fauna from Mexico). An example is the moth Coreura albicosta Draudt (Lepidoptera: Erebidae: Ctenuchina), a rare and apparently endemic species known from southern Mexican cloud forest habitats. To document the distribution of this species, ArcView was used to map its known distribution in Mexico. Maxent models were used to predict C. albicosta's potential distribution. Results indicate that C. albicosta is distributed exclusively in high altitudes along mountainous cloud forests of the Sierra Madre Oriental and the mountains of Chiapas. The Maxent model proved to be highly reliable (AUC = 0.984), and the ability to predict the excluded grid in every model was high (88.9{\%}). Environmental variables with a large contribution to the model were vegetation type and mean annual precipitation. Only 1.0{\%} of the species' known distribution and 6.8{\%} of the potentially favorable grids coincided with the existing network of spaces protected in Mexico. Results emphasize the need to promote the conservation of this endemic cloud forest species and support the proposed inclusion of C. albicosta in the Mexican legislation for species protection with the purpose of conservation.},

abstract = {We know little about how forest bats, which are cryptic and mobile, use roosts on a landscape scale. For widely distributed species like the endangered Indiana bat Myotis sodalis, identifying landscape-scale roost habitat associations will be important for managing the species in different regions where it occurs. For example, in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA, M. sodalis roosts are scattered across a heavily forested landscape, which makes protecting individual roosts impractical during large-scale management activities. We created a predictive spatial model of summer roosting habitat to identify important predictors using the presence-only modeling program MaxEnt and an information theoretic approach for model comparison. Two of 26 candidate models together accounted for {\textgreater}0.93 of AICc weights. Elevation and forest type were top predictors of presence; aspect north/ south and distance-to-ridge were also important. The final average best model indicated that 5{\%} of the study area was suitable habitat and 0.5{\%} was optimal. This model matched our field observations that, in the southern Appalachian Mountains, optimal roosting habitat for M. sodalis is near the ridge top in south-facing mixed pine-hardwood forests at elevations from 260-575 m. Our findings, coupled with data from other studies, suggest M. sodalis is flexible in roost habitat selection across different ecoregions with varying topography and land use patterns. We caution that, while mature pine-hardwood forests are important now, specific areas of suitable and optimal habitat will change over time. Combining the information theoretic approach with presence-only models makes it possible to develop landscape-scale habitat suitability maps for forest bats.This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDM) are increasingly used to understand the factors that regulate variation in biodiversity patterns and to help plan conservation strategies. However, these models are rarely validated with independently collected data and it is unclear whether SDM performance is maintained across distinct habitats and for species with different functional traits. Highly mobile species, such as bees, can be particularly challenging to model. Here, we use independent sets of occurrence data collected systematically in several agricultural habitats to test how the predictive performance of SDMs for wild bee species depends on species traits, habitat type, and sampling technique. We used a species distribution modeling approach parametrized for the Netherlands, with presence records from 1990 to 2010 for 193 Dutch wild bees. For each species, we built a Maxent model based on 13 climate and landscape variables. We tested the predictive performance of the SDMs with independent datasets collected from orchards and arable fields across the Netherlands from 2010 to 2013, using transect surveys or pan traps. Model predictive performance depended on species traits and habitat type. Occurrence of bee species specialized in habitat and diet was better predicted than generalist bees. Predictions of habitat suitability were also more precise for habitats that are temporally more stable (orchards) than for habitats that suffer regular alterations (arable), particularly for small, solitary bees. As a conservation tool, SDMs are best suited to modeling rarer, specialist species than more generalist and will work best in long-term stable habitats. The variability of complex, short-term habitats is difficult to capture in such models and historical land use generally has low thematic resolution. To improve SDMs' usefulness, models require explanatory variables and collection data that include detailed landscape characteristics, for example, variability of crops and flower availability. Additionally, testing SDMs with field surveys should involve multiple collection techniques. {\textcopyright} 2015 Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

Lime1, gravel1, lime 2 and elevation most significantly affect habitat distribution of A. aucheri, while habitat distribution of A. sieberi is affected by elevation, lime1, am1, lime2, and om2. For both species, elevation has an influence on their potential distributions. However, A. aucheri depends more on elevation, and consequently climate in comparison to A. sieberi.

abstract = {Aim: There is widespread concern over the current state of global pollinator populations; however, lack of monitoring means patterns of decline are not well characterized. We aimed to investigate the influence of habitat and climate specializations on bumblebee distribution trends over time using long-term species data. Location: Our study is based on data from the UK and Ireland, for which the most comprehensive set of bumblebee records exists. Previous analysis of the UK data highlighted severe range contractions for a number of species by the 1980s. Methods: We use the most current dataset to quantify the extent of range change over three time periods (pre-1960, 1960-80 and 1981-2012) and to investigate whether species are becoming more marginal, that is occupying areas with more extreme or specialized climatic conditions within the UK and Ireland. For species that have contracted or become more marginal, we predict their climatic specialization within the UK and Ireland using Maxent models, allowing us to associate records with climatic suitability values for each time period and to investigate whether or not species are contracting towards their climatic optimum. Results: We find that populations of most rare bumblebee species appear to have stabilized post-1980, while the more common species appear to have expanded in range. However, rare species tend to have become more marginal in the sites they occupy post-1980, some have contracted towards their predicted climatic optimum and some of which also retracted towards coastal areas. Main conclusions: Our results provide a mixed picture of the state of the UK and Ireland's bumblebee fauna, and must be interpreted with caution as changing patterns of recorder effort may distort real trends. They highlight the need for future monitoring of the abundance of pollinators on both a regional and global scale. {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

Here, with the use of georeferenced centipede data, we explore the importance and contribution of bioclimatic variables and land cover, and predict distribution ranges and potential hotspots in Norway. We used a maximum entropy analysis (Maxent) to model species' distributions, aiming at exploring centres of distribution, latitudinal spans and northern range boundaries of centipedes in Norway. The performance of all Maxent models was better than random with average test area under the curve (AUC) values above 0.893 and True Skill Statistic (TSS) values above 0.593. Our results showed a highly significant latitudinal gradient of increased species richness in southern grid-cells. Mean temperatures of warmest and coldest quarters explained much of the potential distribution of species. Predictive modelling analyses revealed that south-eastern Norway and the Atlantic coast in the west (inclusive of the major fjord system of Sognefjord), are local biodiversity hotspots with regard to high predictive species co-occurrence. We conclude that our predicted northward shifts of centipedes' distributions in Norway are likely a result of post-glacial recolonization patterns, species' ecological requirements and dispersal abilities. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predicting species' potential geographical range by species distribution models (SDMs) is central to understand their ecological requirements. However, the effects of using different modeling techniques need further investigation. In order to improve the prediction effect, we need to assess the predictive performance and stability of different SDMs.
METHODOLOGY: We collected the distribution data of five common tree species (Pinus massoniana, Betula platyphylla, Quercus wutaishanica, Quercus mongolica and Quercus variabilis) and simulated their potential distribution area using 13 environmental variables and six widely used SDMs: BIOCLIM, DOMAIN, MAHAL, RF, MAXENT, and SVM. Each model run was repeated 100 times (trials). We compared the predictive performance by testing the consistency between observations and simulated distributions and assessed the stability by the standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and the 99{\%} confidence interval of Kappa and AUC values.
RESULTS: The mean values of AUC and Kappa from MAHAL, RF, MAXENT, and SVM trials were similar and significantly higher than those from BIOCLIM and DOMAIN trials (p{\textless}0.05), while the associated standard deviations and coefficients of variation were larger for BIOCLIM and DOMAIN trials (p{\textless}0.05), and the 99{\%} confidence intervals for AUC and Kappa values were narrower for MAHAL, RF, MAXENT, and SVM. Compared to BIOCLIM and DOMAIN, other SDMs (MAHAL, RF, MAXENT, and SVM) had higher prediction accuracy, smaller confidence intervals, and were more stable and less affected by the random variable (randomly selected pseudo-absence points).
CONCLUSIONS: According to the prediction performance and stability of SDMs, we can divide these six SDMs into two categories: a high performance and stability group including MAHAL, RF, MAXENT, and SVM, and a low performance and stability group consisting of BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN. We highlight that choosing appropriate SDMs to address a specific problem is an important part of the modeling process.},

abstract = {There is an increasing demand for biodiversity mapping to address new challenges in the management of marine ecosystems. Species distribution models are a key tool in supplying part of this information. However, the use of these models in the marine environment is still developing and the reasons for the underlying use of different methodological approaches are not always clear. In this work, we compared four different statistical techniques: the ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA), the MAXimun ENTropy algorithm (MAXENT), general additive Models (GAMs), and Random Forest. ENFA and MAXENT were applied using presence-only data whereas GAM and Random Forest used presence–absence data. As a case study, we used four deep sea urchin species: Centrostephanus longispinus, Coelopleurus floridanus, Stylocidaris affinis, and Cidaris cidaris. The distribution of the studied sea urchins showed strong bathymetric segregation. Depth was the most important variable, followed by reflectivity and slope. The correlations between the predictive outputs of the models were similar between GAM, Random Forest and MAXENT, and lower for ENFA. Models using presence/absence data showed the highest scores in the four species, significantly outperforming ENFA in most of the cases, although differences with MAXENT were significant in only one species. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract = {Accurate predictions of the impacts of future land use change on species of conservation concern can help to inform policy-makers and improve conservation measures. If predictions are spatially explicit, predicted consequences of likely land use changes could be accessible to land managers at a scale relevant to their working landscape. We introduce a method, based on open source software, which integrates habitat suitability modelling with scenario-building, and illustrate its use by investigating the effects of alternative land use change scenarios on landscape suitability for black grouse Tetrao tetrix. Expert opinion was used to construct five near-future (twenty years) scenarios for the 800 km2 study site in upland Scotland. For each scenario, the cover of different land use types was altered by 5-30{\%} from 20 random starting locations and changes in habitat suitability assessed by projecting a MaxEnt suitability model onto each simulated landscape. A scenario converting grazed land to moorland and open forestry was the most beneficial for black grouse, and 'increased grazing' (the opposite conversion) the most detrimental. Positioning of new landscape blocks was shown to be important in some situations. Increasing the area of opencanopy forestry caused a proportional decrease in suitability, but suitability gains for the 'reduced grazing' scenario were nonlinear. 'Scenario-led' landscape simulation models can be applied in assessments of the impacts of land use change both on individual species and also on diversity and community measures, or ecosystem services. A next step would be to include landscape configuration more explicitly in the simulation models, both to make them more realistic, and to examine the effects of habitat placement more thoroughly. In this example, the recommended policy would be incentives on grazing reduction to benefit black grouse. {\textcopyright} 2015 Gearyet al.

abstract = {Firewood played an indispensable role in European socio-economic systems from prehistory until the nineteenth century. Recent research has shown that in European temperate lowlands the most important management form to produce firewood was coppicing. In spite of the growing body of research on traditional woodland management, there remain large gaps in knowledge. Detailed studies of individual sites or smaller areas have provided a wealth of information on the methods of medieval coppicing, and at such sites the long-term effects of coppicing on vegetation structure and composition have also been examined. However, little is known about the distribution and extent of coppicing at the landscape scale, and forming a coherent picture of the spatial extent rather than the management details of coppicing in larger regions remains a challenge. This paper investigates the distribution and extent of coppice management in Moravia (eastern Czech Republic, ca. 22,300km2) in the Late Middle Ages. We created an extensive database of written sources that contained information on the presence of coppice woods at the parish level. Subsequently we used the MAXENT algorithm to create a model of the distribution of coppicing over the entire area. With the help of wood production and consumption estimates, we also calculated the minimum area of managed woodland for the study period. Results show that coppicing was predominant in the lowlands and often occurred at higher elevations as well, where neither natural conditions nor tree species composition were favourable. The paper also highlights the potential of spatial models based on archival data for historical landscape reconstructions. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) method has gained widespread use for distribution modelling, mostly because of the practical simplicity offered by the maxent.jar software. Whilst MaxEnt was originally described as a machine learning method, recent studies have shown that the method can be explained in terms of maximum likelihood estimation. This opens for using MaxEnt with new settings and options, such as new model selection and model assessment criteria, and improved user control of the variable selection process. New practical tools are needed to explore the new opportunities and assess if they enhance model performance and ecological interpretability of the models. We present a new conceptual framework, the Modular and functionally Integrated component-based Approach (MIA) framework for practical distribution modelling by which the core components of the DM process are decoupled and then wrapped together more flexibly into component-based functional modules. Computational object-oriented and workflow approaches are integrated with ecological, statistical and modelling theory in order to handle the complexity associated with the full modelling process in a practical way. Objects (variables, functions, results, etc.) are defined according to specific modelling parameters. Properties (e.g., identities and content) are inherited between objects and new objects are created in a flexible and automated, yet traceable way. We operationalise this framework for MaxEnt by the MIA Toolbox (MIAT), a set of flexible, modular R-scripts (available in supplementary appendices) wrapped around maxent.jar and existing R-functions. MIAT covers the full range of options and settings for the maximum likelihood implementation of MaxEnt and provide flexible guidance of users through the DM process. A trail of models of increasing complexity is built to enhance traceability and interpretability, and to suit different modelling purposes. We briefly outline research questions that can be addressed by the MIAT. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.},

abstract = {Aim To study the biogeographical factors responsible for the current disjunct distributions of two closely related species of butterflies (Pyrgus cinarae and Pyrgus sidae, Lepidoptera: Hesperioidea). Both species have small populations in the Iberian Peninsula that are isolated by more than 1000km from their nearest conspecifics. Because these species possess similar ecological preferences and geographical distributions, they are excellent candidates for congruent biogeographical histories. Location The Palaearctic region, with a special focus on the Mediterranean peninsulas as glacial refugia. Methods We integrated phylogeography and population genetic analyses with ecological niche modelling. The mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and the non-coding nuclear marker internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) were analysed for 62 specimens of P. cinarae and for 80 of P. sidae to infer phylogeography and to date the origin of disjunct distributions. Current and ancestral [Last Glacial Maximum using MIROC (Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate) and CCSM (Community Climate System Model) circulation models] distribution models were calculated with Maxent. Using present climatic conditions, we delimited the ecological space for each species. Results The genetic structure and potential ancestral distribution of the two species were markedly different. While the Iberian population of P. cinarae had an old origin (c.1Ma), that of P. sidae was closely related to French and Italian lineages (which jointly diverged from eastern populations c.0.27Ma). Ecological niche modelling showed that minor differences in the ecological preferences of the two species seem to account for their drastically different distributional response to the last glacial to post-glacial environmental conditions. Although the potential distribution of P. cinarae was largely unaffected by climate change, suitable habitat for P. sidae strongly shifted in both elevation and latitude. This result might explain the early origin of the disjunct distribution of P. cinarae, in contrast to the more recent disjunction of P. sidae. Main conclusions We show that convergent biogeographical patterns can be analysed with a combination of genetic and ecological niche modelling data. The results demonstrate that species with similar distributional patterns and ecology may still have different biogeographical histories, highlighting the importance of including the temporal dimension when studying biogeographical patterns. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The distribution model of T. ruderatus and T. persicus showed excellent performance for both models (T. ruderatus AUC = 0.964 ± 0.001 and T. persicus AUC = 0.996 ± 0.003), and predicted suitable regions in Iran, Turkey, Iraq and Syria. Niche overlap was measured between the two groups by ENMtools and 13{\%} overlapped. We used a niche identity test to determine differences between the niches of the two species. Finally, by comparing our null hypothesis to the true niche overlap of the two species, we were able to reject our null hypothesis of no difference between the niches.

abstract = {Although spatial scale is important for understanding ecological processes and guiding conservation planning, studies combining a range of scales are rare. Habitat suitability modelling has been used traditionally to study broad-scale patterns of species distribution but can also be applied to address conservation needs at finer scales. We studied the ability of presence-only species distribution modelling to predict patterns of habitat selection at broad and fine spatial scales for one of the rarest mammals in the UK, the grey long-eared bat (Plecotus austriacus). Models were constructed with Maxent using broad-scale distribution data from across the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) and fine-scale radio-tracking data from bats at one colony. Fine-scale model predictions were evaluated with radio-tracking locations from bats from a distant colony, and compared with results of traditional radio-tracking data analysis methods (compositional analysis of habitat selection). Broad-scale models indicated that winter temperature, summer precipitation and land cover were the most important variables limiting the distribution of the grey long-eared bat in the UK. Fine-scale models predicted that proximity to unimproved grasslands and distance to suburban areas determine foraging habitat suitability around maternity colonies, while compositional analysis also identified unimproved grasslands as the most preferred foraging habitat type. This strong association with unimproved lowland grasslands highlights the potential importance of changes in agricultural practices in the past century for wildlife conservation. Hence, multi-scale models offer an important tool for identifying conservation requirements at the fine landscape level that can guide national-level conservation management practices. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The West African cocoa belt, reaching from Sierra Leone to southern Cameroon, is the origin of about 70{\%} of the world's cocoa (Theobroma cacao), which in turn is the basis of the livelihoods of about two million farmers. We analyze cocoa's vulnerability to climate change in the West African cocoa belt, based on climate projections for the 2050s of 19 Global Circulation Models under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change intermediate emissions scenario RCP 6.0. We use a combination of a statistical model of climatic suitability (Maxent) and the analysis of individual, potentially limiting climate variables. We find that: 1) contrary to expectation, maximum dry season temperatures are projected to become as or more limiting for cocoa as dry season water availability; 2) to reduce the vulnerability of cocoa to excessive dry season temperatures, the systematic use of adaptation strategies like shade trees in cocoa farms will be necessary, in reversal of the current trend of shade reduction; 3) there is a strong differentiation of climate vulnerability within the cocoa belt, with the most vulnerable areas near the forest-savanna transition in Nigeria and eastern C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire, and the least vulnerable areas in the southern parts of Cameroon, Ghana, C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire and Liberia; 4) this spatial differentiation of climate vulnerability may lead to future shifts in cocoa production within the region, with the opportunity of partially compensating losses and gains, but also the risk of local production expansion leading to new deforestation. We conclude that adaptation strategies for cocoa in West Africa need to focus at several levels, from the consideration of tolerance to high temperatures in cocoa breeding programs, the promotion of shade trees in cocoa farms, to policies incentivizing the intensification of cocoa production on existing farms where future climate conditions permit and the establishment of new farms in already deforested areas. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.},

Comparison of the equivalence and overlap of the predicted distributions showed no significant differences between the different signs. The contribution of the 11 variables used to build the distribution models was also similar between signs. Although predictions from different signs were similar, the use of different threshold selection methods generated substantially different suitable areas and omission errors. These results highlight the importance of a fundamental understanding of species natural history to determine not only appropriate model parameters, but also the biological relevance of SDMs. My findings also support the need for healthy skepticism regarding what is represented by presence-only species distributions. To help address this skepticism I conclude by providing guidelines for generating reliable local-scale distribution models. {\textcopyright} Darren Norris.},

abstract = {Traditional models of amphibian dispersal and gene flow point to low dispersal and high philopatry. In recent years, this traditional view has been challenged and it appears that no general model holds across taxa. Conservation of amphibians cannot be addressed on an over-arching scale, but must come on a case-by-case basis, especially for range-restricted species where information on gene flow and migration must be incorporated into conservation efforts. The only two members of the genus Capensibufo Grandison, 1980 (Anura: Bufonidae) are range restricted small bufonids, with distributions limited to montane areas in South Africa. Using a Bayesian analysis of two mitochondrial markers (16S and ND2), we examined the genetic patterns in Capensibufo rosei and Capensibufo tradouwi in order to understand both taxonomic and geographic boundaries. These species were not monophyletic, and demonstrate no clear taxonomic boundaries. Instead, the genus is extremely diverse genetically, with distinct lineages confined to isolated mountains that represent geographic boundaries. In addition, bioclimatic modelling using MAXENT and scenarios of climatic conditions at both the present and last glacial maximum suggest multiple bioclimatic and physical barriers to gene flow at present and in the past. We conclude that members of the genus have very low vagility, that current taxonomic boundaries are inadequate, and that strong geographic structuring has undoubtedly contributed to genetic diversity at the species level, rather than the population level. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract = {Species distribution modeling is widely applied to predict invasive species distributions and species range shifts under climate change. Accurate predictions depend upon meeting the assumption that ecological niches are conserved, i.e., spatially or temporally transferable. Here we present a multi-taxon comparative analysis of niche conservatism using biological invasion events well documented in natural history museum collections. Our goal is to assess spatial transferability of the climatic niche of a range of noxious terrestrial invasive species using two complementary approaches. First we compare species' native versus invasive ranges in environmental space using two distinct methods, Principal Components Analysis and Mahalanobis distance. Second we compare species' native versus invaded ranges in geographic space as estimated using the species distribution modeling technique Maxent and the comparative index Hellinger's I. We find that species exhibit a range of responses, from almost complete transferability, in which the invaded niches completely overlap with the native niches, to a complete dissociation between native and invaded ranges. Intermediate responses included expansion of dimension attributable to either temperature or precipitation derived variables, as well as niche expansion in multiple dimensions. We conclude that the ecological niche in the native range is generally a poor predictor of invaded range and, by analogy, the ecological niche may be a poor predictor of range shifts under climate change. We suggest that assessing dimensions of niche transferability prior to standard species distribution modeling may improve the understanding of species' dynamics in the invaded range. {\textcopyright} 2015 Fern{\'{a}}ndez, Hamilton.},

abstract = {Prior to modeling the potential distribution of a species it is recommended to carry out analyses to reduce errors in the model, especially those caused by the spatial autocorrelation of presence data or the multi-collinearity of the environmental predictors used. This paper proposes statistical methods to solve drawbacks frequently disregarded when such models are built. We use spatial records of 3 species characteristic of the Mexican humid mountain forest and 2 sets of original variables. The selection of presence-only records with no autocorrelation was made by applying both randomness and pattern analyses. Through principal component analysis (PCA) the 2 sets of original variables were transformed into 4 different sets to produce the species distribution models with the modeling application in Maxent. Model precision was higher than 90{\%} applying a binomial test and was always higher than 0.9 with the area under the curve (AUC) and with the partial receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The results show that the records selected with the randomness method proposed here and the use of the PCA to select the environmental predictors generated more parsimonious predictive models, with a precision higher than 95{\%}, and in addition, the response variables show no spatial autocorrelation.},

abstract = {Aim We evaluate the extent to which the tropical conservatism hypothesis can explain the evolutionary development of the Muscidae. Furthermore, we compare the geographical patterns of muscid phylogenetic structure with biogeographical regions that have been identified for Neotropical insects. Location Central and South America. Methods We modelled the geographic distributions of 658 species using Maxent and 19 environmental variables. A generic-level supertree of the Muscidae was assembled using matrix representation with parsimony and used to map the geographic pattern of mean root distance (MRD), a metric of the relative evolutionary development of assemblages. Regression models (ordinary least squares and regression trees) were used to examine temperature and other environmental correlates of MRD to explore potential environmental drivers of muscid diversification. We used the regression tree results to recognize variable intervals that best explained MRD, and these intervals were mapped to recognize and compare with biogeographical regions of Neotropical insects. Results The geographic pattern of MRD was consistent with the tropical conservatism hypothesis: species in genera that diversified relatively early, as measured by their distance from the tree root, dominate lowland tropical South America, whereas species in genera that diversified more recently occupy extra-tropical areas, sub-Antarctic areas and the Andean highlands. Temperature was the strongest correlate of MRD. Three biogeographical regions were recognized and they coincided with two regions known for insects. Main conclusions Evolutionary responses of muscid flies to post-Eocene climate change taking the form of an expansion of a tropical group into regions with colder climates may be fundamental to explaining their distribution in the Neotropics. Our biogeographical regions delimited by temperature and the phylogenetic metric, surrogates of the tropical conservatism hypothesis, were very similar to general insect patterns, supporting the 'tropical origin and evolutionary response to climate cooling' as a broadly based historical narrative for the Neotropics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Scientific research has been limited to two sites within its range (Chamela and Valle Motagua) outside of these two regions there have not been adequate surveys to define range limits or measure environmental correlates for defining suitable habitat. We constructed an ensemble model (EM) for the distribution of suitable habitat for H. horridum in both Mexico and Guatemala and then used that model to identify potential areas to focus conservation. We used nine presence-only modeling methods, and selected three to generate our EM. We used the EM to evaluate the efficacy of the existing Protected Natural Areas (PNAs) in Mexico and Guatemala for H. horridum. Also we used the best individual predictive model (Maxent) to obtain the most important factors for H. horridum presence and used them to analyse the habitat use; finally we used our predictive model to calculate niche breath for the species. The estimated potential distribution of H. horridum is 370,474km 2; within this area we identified nine zones based on continuity and natural barriers. About 1.5{\%} of the species distribution is under protection in the PNAs. The five most important factors for the presence of this species explained 78.2{\%} of the generated model and are related to seasonality and soil cover, and these are used selectively. This species is closely associated with tropical deciduous forests, one of the most threatened ecosystems worldwide and is inadequately protected in both Mexico and Guatemala. Our results clearly show the necessity of a protection plan for this species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used for extrapolation, or predicting suitable regions for species under new geographic or temporal scenarios. However, SDM predictions may be prone to errors if species are not at equilibrium with climatic conditions in the current range and if training samples are not representative. Here the controversial "Pleistocene rewilding" proposal was used as a novel example to address some of the challenges of extrapolating modeled species-climate relationships outside of current ranges. Climatic suitability for three proposed proxy species (Asian elephant, African cheetah and African lion) was extrapolated to the American southwest and Great Plains using Maxent, a machine-learning species distribution model. Similar models were fit for Oryx gazella, a species native to Africa that has naturalized in North America, to test model predictions. To overcome biases introduced by contracted modern ranges and limited occurrence data, random pseudo-presence points generated from modern and historical ranges were used for model training. For all species except the oryx, models of climatic suitability fit to training data from historical ranges produced larger areas of predicted suitability in North America than models fit to training data from modern ranges. Four naturalized oryx populations in the American southwest were correctly predicted with a generous model threshold, but none of these locations were predicted with a more stringent threshold. In general, the northern Great Plains had low climatic suitability for all focal species and scenarios considered, while portions of the southern Great Plains and American southwest had low to intermediate suitability for some species in some scenarios. The results suggest that the use of historical, in addition to modern, range information and randomly sampled pseudo-presence points may improve model accuracy. This has implications for modeling range shifts of organisms in response to climate change.},

abstract = {In the coastal waters of Johor Straits, Peninsular Malaysia, the dugongs occur and their habitat suitability model has yet not been attempted, while it could be critical information for developing their conservation strategies. This study derived spatially explicit dugong population information on the abundance and distribution of dugongs based on fisher surveys. The survey revealed the highest dugong abundance around eastern areas, followed by southern areas of Johor Straits. Degradation of seagrass habitat, which dugong uses as feeding ground, could be the main reason for reducing dugong sighting around western areas. A habitat suitability map was produced based on dugong presence and interacting environmental factors such as seagrass biomass, distance from shoreline, and water depth. Using ArcGIS mapping capability, the data layers on those environmental factors were fied into MaxEnt. The MaxEnt model output showed seagrass biomass as the highest contributing factor to the likelihood of dugong presence. The model also estimated 20 kg/m2 of seagrass biomass, 3 km distance from shoreline and a water depth of 25 m as the optimum habitat condition for dugong population. The combination of fisher interview, habitat suitability, and risk modeling has the ability to provide adequate information required for monitoring and developing policy strategies for sustainable management and conservation of marine mammals. {\textcopyright} 2017},

Both species add significant habitat complexity to the benthic environment, and support a host of invertebrate species. Mapping their distribution is an essential step in conservation and resource management, but challenging as a result of their remoteness. In this study, three predictive models - Ecological Niche Factor Analysis, Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production and Maximum Entropy modeling (MaxEnt) were applied to predict the distribution of species' suitable habitat across a region of R{\o}st Reef (Norwegian margin) based on multiscale terrain variables.All three models were successful in predicting the habitat suitability for both gorgonian species across the study area, and the MaxEnt predictions were shown to outperform other predictions. All three models predicted the most suitable habitats for both species to mainly occur along the ridges and on the upper section of the large slide, suggesting both species preferentially colonize topographic highs. Jackknife tests for MaxEnt predictions highlighted the seabed aspect in relation to P. arborea distribution, and the seabed relative position (curvature) in relation to the distribution of both species. Given the vulnerability of deep-water corals to anthropogenic impacts, further comparative study over a wider study area would be particularly beneficial for the management of the species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Sunda clouded leopard Neofelis diardi is a medium sized (15–25 kg) cat, found only on the Sundaic islands of Borneo and Sumatra. In recent years intensive camera-trapping surveys in Borneo have begun to shed light on the habitat associations and basic ecology of this elusive wild cat, but its distribution on an island-wide scale remains very poorly known. Such information is an essential element in the assessment of the Sunda clouded leopard's conservation status and in the development of conservation action. In this paper we use MaxEnt niche distribution modelling to make predictions regarding the current distribution of this cat on Borneo. We collected a total of 259 occurrence records for the Sunda clouded leopard, stemming from all Bornean regions apart from Brunei and South Kalimantan, of which 48 (Balanced Model) or 94 (Spatial Filtering Model) were used in our modelling. Our habitat suitability model suggests that this species has a widespread distribution over a large contiguous portion of Borneo. The only exception is South Kalimantan, which is predicted largely to comprise unsuitable habitat. The predicted distribution closely follows the current distribution of little-encroached forest on Borneo (including selectively logged and unlogged areas). The species is notably predicted to be absent from the extensive areas of oil palm plantation, particularly in much of the low-lying coastal land. The predicted range encompasses a large proportion of the existing and proposed protected area network on Borneo. We highlight the priority areas for the conservation of the Sunda clouded leopard in Borneo based on our predicted distribution. {\textcopyright} 2016 National University of Singapore.},

abstract = {Brachystegia spiciformis Benth. is the dominant component of miombo, the sub-tropical woodlands which cover 2.7 million km2 of south-central Africa and which is coincident with the largest regional centre of endemism in Africa. However, pollen records from the genus Brachystegia suggest that miombo has experienced rapid range retraction (∼450 km) from its southernmost distributional limit over the past 6000 years. This abrupt biological response created an isolated (by ∼200 km) and incomparable relict at the trailing population edge in northeast South Africa. These changes in miombo population dynamics may have been triggered by minor natural shifts in temperature and moisture regimes. If so, B. spiciformis is likely to be especially responsive to present and future anthropogenic climate change. This rare situation offers a unique opportunity to investigate climatic determinants of range shift at the trailing edge of a savanna species. A niche modelling approach was used to produce present-day and select future B. spiciformis woodland ecological niche models. In keeping with recent historical range shifts, further ecological niche retraction of between 30.6{\%} and 47.3{\%} of the continuous miombo woodland in Zimbabwe and southern Mozambique is predicted by 2050. Persistence of the existing relict under future climate change is plausible, but range expansion to fragmented refugia in northeast South Africa is unlikely. As Brachystegia woodland and associated biota form crucial socio-economic and biodiversity components of savannas in southern Africa, their predicted further range retraction is of concern. {\textcopyright} 2015.

We studied its phylogenetic position for the first time using mitochondrial and nuclear markers for all species of Larvivora and a broad selection of other species in the family Muscicapidae. Our results confirmed that L. ruficeps is appropriately placed in the genus Larvivora, and suggested that it is sister to the Rufous-tailed Robin Larvivora sibilans, with these two forming a sister clade to a clade comprising both the Japanese Robin Larvivora akahige and Ryukyu Robin Larvivora komadori. Siberian Blue Robin Larvivora cyane and Indian Blue Robin Larvivora brunnea form the sister clade to the other Larvivora species. In contrast, song analyses indicated that the song of L. ruficeps is most similar to that of L. komadori, whereas the song of L. sibilans is relatively more similar to that of L. akahige, and songs of L. cyane and L. brunnea closely resemble each other. We used ecological niche modelling to estimate the suitable habitats of L. ruficeps based on the records from breeding grounds, suggesting that north and central Sichuan, south Gansu, south Shaanxi and south-east Tibet are likely to contain the most suitable habitats for this species. {\textcopyright} 2016 British Ornithologists' Union},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used to predict distributions of invasive species. If successful, these models can help managers target limited resources for monitoring and controlling invasive species to areas of high invasion risk. Model accuracy is usually determined using current species distributions, but because invasive species are not at equilibrium with the environment, high current accuracy may not indicate high future accuracy. I used 1982 species distribution data from Bolleswood Natural Area, Connecticut, USA, to create SDMs for two forest invaders, Celastrus orbiculatus and Rosa multiflora. I then used more recent data, from 1992 and 2002, as validation data sets to determine how model accuracy changed over time and if current and future accuracy were related. I also tested if three alternative approaches - iterative modeling, alternative methods of choosing suitability thresholds and using a risk assessment framework - improved accuracy in predicting future distributions. Model accuracy declined over time with greater declines for models of the species (Celastrus) with the higher initial accuracy. By 2002, 49{\%} of Celastrus and 85{\%} of Rosa new occurrences were correctly predicted by models. Neither iterative modeling nor alternative thresholds improved accuracy of predicting 2002 occurrences, but a risk assessment framework showed promise for guiding monitoring efforts. These results suggest that measures of current accuracy may not indicate a model's predictive accuracy and must be used cautiously. Distinguishing between predictions of current and future distributions is critical. While iterative models were not successful in this study, I argue that using models in a risk assessment framework closely tied to monitoring will greatly increase the utility of SDMs for managing invasive species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The majority of studies comparing the response of biotic metrics to environmental stress in rivers are based on relatively small, homogeneous datasets resulting from research projects. Here, we used a large dataset from Austrian and German national river monitoring programmes (2,302 sites) to analyse the response of fish, diatom and macroinvertebrate metrics to four stressors acting at different scales (hydromorphology, physico-chemistry, riparian and catchment land use). Nutrient enrichment and catchment land use were the main discriminating stressors for all organism groups, over-ruling the effects of hydromorphological stress on the site scale. The response of fish metrics to stress was generally low, while macroinvertebrate metrics performed best. The Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) responded most strongly to all stressors in the mountain streams, while different metrics were responsive in the lowlands. Our results suggest that many rivers are still considerably affected by nutrient enrichment (eutrophication), which might directly point at implications of catchment land use. We conclude that monitoring datasets are well-suited to detect major broad-scale trends of degradation and their impact on riverine assemblages, while the more subtle effects of local-scale stressors require stream type-specific approaches.},

abstract = {Aim: Studying the changes in species ranges during the last glaciation event is an important step towards the understanding of the observed patterns of intra-specific genetic variability. We focused on bumblebees, an interesting biological model to address these questions because cold-adapted species are likely to have experienced different geographical range histories during the last glacial period compared to more commonly studied, strictly temperate, species. We investigated and compared historical hypotheses regarding the geographical range of five common and co-distributed West Palaearctic bumblebee species. Location: Europe, West Palaearctic. Methods: For each species, we inferred present and past (Last Glacial Maximum) distributions from species occurrence records, and present and past climatic data, using the ecological niche modelling (ENM) approach implemented in Maxent. Based on genetic data previously obtained from the sequencing of three gene fragments (mitochondrial locus COI and two nuclear loci EF-1$\alpha$ and PEPCK), we then compared global and local patterns of genetic variation using several summary statistics as well as a visual mapping of genetic variation. Finally, we used a spatially explicit model of DNA sequence coalescence to test and compare four evolutionary scenarios derived from ENM results and patterns of genetic diversity. Results: Ecological niche modelling results based on climatic data clearly suggested a range continuum in Europe during the last glaciation. Yet, the related evolutionary scenario involving such continuum was less supported than alternative scenarios involving a more fragmented distribution. Indeed, for the three out of five species for which genetic data allowed discriminating among tested scenarios, the scenario that included a fragmented range during the last glaciation was identified as the most likely. Main conclusions: Although ENM suggested that bumblebees would have maintained a range continuum across Europe during the last glaciation, coalescent simulations tended to refute the persistence of a large range continuum for these species during this period. This suggests that even for cold-adapted species, the cooling periods have significantly shrunk and fragmented their respective ranges. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

abstract = {Aim: We explore the utility of newly available optical and microwave remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and QuikSCAT (QSCAT) instruments for species distribution modelling at regional to continental scales. Using eight Neotropical species from three taxonomic groups, we assess the extent to which remote sensing data can improve predictions of their geographic distributions. For two bird species, we investigate the specific contributions of different types of remote sensing variables to the predictions and model accuracy at the regional scale, where the benefits of the MODIS and QSCAT satellite data are expected to be most significant. Location: South America, with a focus on the tropical and subtropical Andes and the Amazon Basin. Methods: Potential geographic distributions of eight species, namely two birds, two mammals and four trees, were modelled with the maxent algorithm at 1-km resolution over the South American continent using climatic and remote sensing data separately and combined. For each species and model scenario, we assess model performance by testing the agreement between observed and simulated distributions across all thresholds and, in the case of the two focal bird species, at selected thresholds. Results: Quantitative performance tests showed that models built with remote sensing and climatic layers in isolation performed well in predicting species distributions, suggesting that each of these data sets contains useful information. However, predictions created with a combination of remote sensing and climatic layers generally resulted in the best model performance across the three taxonomic groups. In Ecuador, the inclusion of remote sensing data was critical in resolving the known geographically isolated populations of the two focal bird species along the steep Amazonian-Andean elevational gradients. Within remote sensing subsets, microwave-based data were more important than optical data in the predictions of the two bird species. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that the newly available remote sensing data (MODIS and QSCAT) have considerable utility in modelling the contemporary geographical distributions of species at both regional and continental scales and in predicting range shifts as a result of large-scale land-use change. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {The Japanese National Biodiversity Strategy 2010 calls for the creation of ecological networks as a biodiversity conservation policy. However, there is an obvious lack of information on the spatial distribution of many species and a lack of scientific methods for examining habitat requirements to establish the need for constructing these networks for target species. This study presents a quantitative method for assessing the need for ecological networks through modeling the potential geographic distributions of species based on a case study of local populations of Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus japonicus) in Fuji and Tanzawa, Japan. A total of 1541 point records of occurrences of Asiatic black bears and 11 potential predictors were analyzed in a GIS environment. After a predictive distributional map was obtained using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm, a gap analysis was carried out and population size was estimated. Approximately 24{\%} of the bear's predicted habitat area fell within a wildlife protection area, 2{\%} within a nature reserve, and 37{\%} within natural parks. Conservation forest comprised 54{\%} of the total area of predicted habitat; of this, national forest comprised 2{\%}, and private and communal forest comprised 37{\%}. The total estimated Asiatic black bear population in this region was 242, with 179 individuals in the Fuji local population, 26 in the Tanzawa local population, and 37 in the corridor patch between the two local populations. Our study also found a potential corridor connecting the Fuji and Tanzawa local populations, as well as potential habitat corridors in the Fuji region containing subpopulations on Mt. Fuji (119 individuals) and Mt. Kenashi (53 individuals). An additional subpopulation on Mt. Ashitaka (7 individuals) is isolated and not fully protected by a zoning plan. Mt. Furo's subpopulation is considered to be almost extinct, although black bears were observed here until 2002 based on the report by Mochizuki et al. (2005). The total black bear population of the Fuji-Tanzawa region is considered to be "endangered" ; thus, an adequate population size might be difficult to maintain even if this region were to be internally connected by means of an ecological network. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Xenophyophores are a group of exclusively deep-sea agglutinating rhizarian protozoans, at least some of which are foraminifera. They are an important constituent of the deep-sea megafauna that are sometimes found in sufficient abundance to act as a significant source of habitat structure for meiofaunal and macrofaunal organisms. This study utilised maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) and a high-resolution environmental database to explore the environmental factors controlling the presence of Xenophyophorea and two frequently sampled xenophyophore species that are taxonomically stable: Syringammina fragilissima and Stannophyllum zonarium. These factors were also used to predict the global distribution of each taxon. Areas of high habitat suitability for xenophyophores were highlighted throughout the world[U+05F3]s oceans, including in a large number of areas yet to be suitably sampled, but the Northeast and Southeast Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, the Red Sea and deep-water regions of the Malay Archipelago represented particular hotspots. The two species investigated showed more specific habitat requirements when compared to the model encompassing all xenophyophore records, perhaps in part due to the smaller number and relatively more clustered nature of the presence records available for modelling at present. The environmental variables depth, oxygen parameters, nitrate concentration, carbon-chemistry parameters and temperature were of greatest importance in determining xenophyophore distributions, but, somewhat surprisingly, hydrodynamic parameters were consistently shown to have low importance, possibly due to the paucity of well-resolved global hydrodynamic datasets. The results of this study (and others of a similar type) have the potential to guide further sample collection, environmental policy, and spatial planning of marine protected areas and industrial activities that impact the seafloor, particularly those that overlap with aggregations of these conspicuously large single-celled eukaryotes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

We developed Maximum Entropy models in three seasons.This study aims to determine the habitat desirability and factors affecting wild goats using a maximum entropy algorithm. Environmental variables used in modeling the three seasons of winter, spring, and summer include elevation classes, slope, direction, vegetation, distance to water sources, distance to the rocky substrate, distance to roads (asphalt, soil), and distance to mines. The results show that the most important factors affecting habitat desirability of the wild goat in winter, spring, and summer include the ratio of distance variable to the rocky cliffs, slope, and distance to water resources. According to the predictions, wild goats are most likely to be found in the northern, central and southeastern areas of the Dareh Anjir Wildlife Refuge, which are considered the most desirable habitats of the species and its associated predator (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) over the three seasons.The results of this study can be used as a valuable tool in implementing conservation and management strategies in order to enhance the desirable habitats in the province of Yazd (Dareh Anjir Wildlife Refuge). {\textcopyright} 2014 - Journal Management System.},

abstract = {Species distribution models were used to predict bat species richness across southern Africa and to identify potential drivers of these spatial patterns. We also identified species richness within each biotic zone and the distributions of species considered of high conservation priority. We used this information to highlight conservation priorities for bats in southern Africa defined here as between the latitudes of 8° S, slightly north of Zambia, to the southern tip of Africa 34° S, an area of approximately 9781840 km2. We used maximum entropy modelling Maxent to model habitat suitability for 58 bat species in order to determine the key eco-geographical variables influencing their distributions. The potential distribution of each bat species was affected by different eco-geographic variables but in general, water availability both temporary and permanent, seasonal precipitation, vegetation, and karst caves/limestone areas were the most important factors. The highest levels of species richness were found mainly in the eastern dry savanna area and some areas of wet savanna. Of the species considered to be of high priority due to a combination of restricted distributions or niches and/or endemism 7 fruit bats, 23 cave-dwellers, 18 endemic and near-endemic, 14 niche-restricted and 15 range-restricted), nine species were considered to be at most risk. We found that range-restricted species were commonly found in areas with low species richness; therefore, conservation decisions need to take into account not only species richness but also species considered to be particularly vulnerable across the biogeographical area of interest. {\textcopyright} 2016 Associazione Teriologica Italiana.},

abstract = {Habitat suitability maps are commonly created by modeling a species' environmental niche from occurrences and environmental characteristics. Here, we introduce the hyper-envelope modeling interface (HEMI), providing a new method for creating habitat suitability models using Bezier surfaces to model a species niche in environmental space. HEMI allows modeled surfaces to be visualized and edited in environmental space based on expert knowledge and does not require absence points for model development. The modeled surfaces require relatively few parameters compared to similar modeling approaches and may produce models that better match ecological niche theory. As a case study, we modeled the invasive species tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) in the western USA. We compare results from HEMI with those from existing similar modeling approaches (including BioClim, BioMapper, and Maxent). We used synthetic surfaces to create visualizations of the various models in environmental space and used modified area under the curve (AUC) statistic and akaike information criterion (AIC) as measures of model performance. We show that HEMI produced slightly better AUC values, except for Maxent and better AIC values overall. HEMI created a model with only ten parameters while Maxent produced a model with over 100 and BioClim used only eight. Additionally, HEMI allowed visualization and editing of the model in environmental space to develop alternative potential habitat scenarios. The use of Bezier surfaces can provide simple models that match our expectations of biological niche models and, at least in some cases, out-perform more complex approaches. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {The 'arc of deforestation' of southern Amazonia has experienced one of the highest deforestation rates documented anywhere in the world and remaining forest patches are being rapidly converted into managed pastures. Understanding how forest and nonforest carnivores cope with habitat fragmentation in tropical agricultural frontiers and which species are more prone to extinction is an important tool for conservation planning. However, the secretive behaviour and low population densities of carnivores render data collection difficult. Thus, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical tools to interpret data for species distributions. Here, we use data from a long-term research program to determine the distribution of four sympatric mid-sized carnivore species and environmental factors related to their spatial distribution in a highly fragmented landscape using maximum entropy (MAXENT) modelling. MAXENT models-built from camera trapping, direct and indirect sighting records-indicate that land-cover, distance to water sources and distance from urban centres were the most important environmental variables of mid-sized carnivore species occurrence. In fact, land-cover and distance to water explained more than 80{\%} for the occurrence of all four sympatric species in our study area. Higher probability of occurrences in areas closer to sources of water were especially important for Eira barbara and Leopardus pardalis, whereas areas closer to the urban centre showed lower probability of occurrences for Cerdocyon thous, E. barbara and L. pardalis. Of these carnivore species, C. thous was the only one that had higher probabilities of occurrence in non-forest areas. Thus, current levels of deforestation in the study region are likely to expand the distribution of C. thous but reduce the distribution of forest-dependent species such as L. pardalis and L. wiedii. This suggests that the region requires greater efforts in environmental law enforcement and education programmes to maintain the remaining forest cover and forest wildlife populations. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract = {Context Urbanisation is one of the most damaging landscape-scale disturbance processes leading to significant and potentially irreversible changes in biodiversity. How apex predators respond to urbanisation is poorly understood, largely because of their low density and low detectability. Given the important functional roles of apex predators in ecosystems, it is critical that research investigates how they respond to urbanisation, and how urban systems can be designed to better support apex predators. Aims The present research aims to examine how an avian apex predator, the powerful owl, responds to a complete urban-forest gradient in southern Victoria, Australia. Specifically, the research aims to understand the environmental attributes that drive habitat suitability for powerful owls across the urban-forest gradient. Methods Using a total of 683 independent field- and atlas-derived records of powerful owls across the study site, the research takes a presence-only modelling approach. The presence points were modelled against a series of geospatial variables that were determined a priori on the basis of the known ecology of powerful owls. Key results Potential powerful owl habitat declined in a dramatic fashion in response to increasing levels of urbanisation, ranging from 76{\%} of the forest landscape to 21{\%} of the urban landscape. Powerful owl habitat availability across the urban-forest gradient is positively influenced by tree cover, productivity (normalised difference vegetation index) and proximity to river systems and riparian vegetation. Conclusions Presence-only modelling has provided a useful way for investigating the response of an apex predator to a gradient of urbanisation. Although powerful owl habitat availability is negatively reduced by urbanisation, there is significant scope to manage urban landscapes to either maintain or improve the availability of habitat across the gradient. Implications High resource-requiring species, such as apex predators, have the capacity to be detrimentally affected by urbanisation processes. Presence-only modelling, however, provides a useful tool for investigating how these difficult-to-detect species are affected by urbanisation, and ultimately inform how landscapes can be managed to maximise habitat availability for apex predators. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2013.},

abstract = {Ecological niche models assume a species niche should be conserved over space and time. Increasingly, studies have determined that niche shifts may occur during biological invasion events. The aim of this study is to examine niche conservation for two invasive crane flies, Tipula oleracea Linnaeus and Tipula paludosa Meigen, after introductions into North America. These species have broadly sympatric invasive distributions but differ in time since introduction and dispersal abilities. As these factors may impact the area accessible to dispersal, I examined the impact of background area delineation on conclusions of niche conservation. Results indicated that alternative delineations of accessible area (i. e., background area) had no affect on measures of niche equivalence. Neither Tipula species was found to be occupying invasive niche space equivalent to that of their native ranges. Niche dissimilarity was found for both species, with results strongly impacted by the choice of background area. T. paludosa introductions displayed a niche shift across both invasive introductions when the model area drew climatic information from an area that buffered occurrences by 40 km. The eastern T. oleracea introduction displayed a niche shift when background information was drawn from within a 400 km buffered area. This study suggests that invasive populations may be displaying a niche shift when evaluated against one scale of background but conserved when evaluated against another scale. Dispersal limitations for T. oleracea in its eastern introduction and anthropogenic habitat associations for T. paludosa across both invasive introductions are indicated as causes for the observed niche shifts. The results of this study highlight the importance of carefully delineating the area accessible to invasive species in studies of niche conservation. Furthermore, it indicates that examining several spatial extents of background areas can be beneficial when examining niche conservation for species in non-equilibrium states. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In order to model and map the current and future (under projected climate change settings) climatically-suitable area for the species, Maxent modeling technique, that requires presence-only records, was employed. As predictors, we extracted 19 bioclimatic variables from ‘WorldClim' database with a ∼1 km spatial resolution and used 10 uncorrelated bioclimatic variables as inputs. As indicated by a high area under ROC curve (AUC) value ({\textgreater}0.9), Maxent well performed and predicted climatically-suitable habitat for the species along the Hindukush Himalaya, where the species is known to occur. Annual mean temperature appeared to most influence the distribution of potential habitat for the species. An expansion of species' habitat was noticed in the Indian and Tibetan part of species range, suggesting a potential future effect of climate change on the species distribution. The findings of this study could assist wildlife managers in devising conservation plans for the current and future conservation of the species in the context of climate change.

We used a well-tested maximum entropy species distribution model (Maxent) to map the Yosemite toad (Anaxyrus (= Bufo) canorus) in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. Twenty-six environmental variables were included in the model representing climate, topography, land cover type, and disturbance factors (e.g., distances to agricultural lands, fire perimeters, and timber harvest areas) throughout the historic range of the toad. We then took a novel approach to the study of spatially structured populations by applying the species-environmental matching model separately for 49 consistently occupied sites of the Yosemite toad compared to 27 intermittently occupied sites. We found that the distribution of the entire population was highly predictable (AUC = 0.95±0.03 SD), and associated with low slopes, specific vegetation types (wet meadow, alpine-dwarf shrub, montane chaparral, red fir, and subalpine conifer), and warm temperatures. The consistently occupied sites were also associated with these same factors, and they were also highly predictable (AUC = 0.95±0.05 SD). However, the intermittently occupied sites were associated with distance to fire perimeter, a slightly different response to vegetation types, distance to timber harvests, and a much broader set of aspect classes (AUC = 0.90±0.11 SD). We conclude that many studies of species distributions may benefit by modeling spatially structured populations separately. Modeling and monitoring consistently-occupied sites may provide a realistic snapshot of current species-environment relationships, important climatic and topographic patterns associated with species persistence patterns, and an understanding of the plasticity of the species to respond to varying climate regimes across its range. Meanwhile, modeling and monitoring of widely dispersing individuals and intermittently occupied sites may uncover environmental thresholds and human-related threats to population persistence. {\textcopyright} 2011 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Species distribution models are increasing in popularity for mapping suitable habitat for species of management concern. Many investigators now recognize that extrapolations of these models with geographic information systems (GIS) might be sensitive to the environmental bounds of the data used in their development, yet there is no recommended best practice for "clamping" model extrapolations. We relied on two commonly used modeling approaches: classification and regression tree (CART) and maximum entropy (Maxent) models, and we tested a simple alteration of the model extrapolations, bounding extrapolations to the maximum and minimum values of primary environmental predictors, to provide a more realistic map of suitable habitat of hybridized Africanized honey bees in the southwestern United States. Findings suggest that multiple models of bounding, and the most conservative bounding of species distribution models, like those presented here, should probably replace the unbounded or loosely bounded techniques currently used. {\textcopyright} 2011 Current Zoology.},

abstract = {Wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations in many areas of the Palearctic including the Iberian Peninsula have grown continuously over the last century. This increase has led to numerous different types of conflicts due to the damage these mammals can cause to agriculture, the problems they create in the conservation of natural areas, and the threat they pose to animal health. In the context of both wildlife management and the design of health programs for disease control, it is essential to know how wild boar are distributed on a large spatial scale. Given that the quantifying of the distribution of wild species using census techniques is virtually impossible in the case of large-scale studies, modeling techniques have thus to be used instead to estimate animals' distributions, densities, and abundances. In this study, the potential distribution of wild boar in Spain was predicted by integrating data of presence and environmental variables into a MaxEnt approach. We built and tested models using 100 bootstrapped replicates. For each replicate or simulation, presence data was divided into two subsets that were used for model fitting (60{\%} of the data) and cross-validation (40{\%} of the data). The final model was found to be accurate with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.79. Six explanatory variables for predicting wild boar distribution were identified on the basis of the percentage of their contribution to the model. The model exhibited a high degree of predictive accuracy, which has been confirmed by its agreement with satellite images and field surveys. {\textcopyright} 2014 Ministerio de Agricultura Pesca y Alimentacion.

Early detection and prediction of areas potentially at risk is crucial to minimise ecological and socio-economic costs. Maxent was used to predict the area within which Ageratina adenophora can potentially naturalise and spread in South Africa. The model was set up with 1020 occurrence records (10 replicates, 70{\%} of records for calibration:30{\%} for validation), and four climatic predictor variables. Background data were selected using K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger (vegetation-based) climate classification zones. All model replicates performed better than random in both binomial tests of omission and ROC analysis. The model was statistically significant and its mean AUC was 94{\%}. The modeled prevalence was 0.21 and the sensitivity was 0.99. The Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Gauteng provinces have climatic conditions indicative of a high potential for invasion by A. adenophora, followed by parts of the Western Cape, North West and Limpopo provinces. The model predicted areas beyond the current distribution, suggesting that A. adenophora has potential for further spread, and that searches for it need to be made beyond its currently known distribution. On the other hand it appears not to have spread into some climatically suitable areas near its current occupancy sites, such as throughout the KwaZulu-Natal mist belt, suggesting that unknown biotic (including human) or abiotic factors are also limiting its naturalization and require further study to be identified. {\textcopyright} 2014 South African Association of Botanists.},

Specificity increased significantly from coarse to finer-scale models due to the reduction of overprediction. The variability of environmental space (E-space) differed for most of climatic variables between continental and biome-scale and the representation of the E-space by predictors differed significantly (t = 2.42, g.l.= 9, P {\textless} 0.05).

abstract = {The evaluation of species distribution models (SDMs) is a crucial step; usually, a random subsample of data is used to test prediction capacity. This procedure, called cross-validation, has been recently shown to overestimate SDMs performance due to spatial autocorrelation. In the case of expanding species, there exists the possibility to test the predictions with non-random geographically structured data, i.e., a new data set which corresponds to the last occupied localities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of SDMs to predict the range expansion pattern of six free-living deer species in Great Britain and to assess whether SDMs perform better than a simple dispersal model - a null model that assumes no environmental control in the expansion process. Distribution data for the species prior to 1972 were used to train the SDMs (ENFA, MAXENT, logistic regression and an ensemble model) in order to obtain suitability maps. Additionally, the geographical distance to the localities occupied in 1972 was considered a proxy of the probability that a certain locality has to be occupied during an expansion process considering only dispersal (GD model). Subsequently, we analysed whether the species increased their ranges between 1972 and 2006 according to the estimated suitability patterns and whether or not SDMs predictions outperformed GD predictions. SDMs showed a high discrimination capacity in the training data, with the ensemble models performing the best and ENFA models the worst. SDMs predictions also worked better than chance in classifying new occupied localities, although differences among techniques disappeared and the predictions showed no difference with respect to GD. Spatial autocorrelation of both the environmental predictors and the expansion process may explain these results which illustrate that GD is a much more parsimonious model than any of the SDMs and may thus be preferable both for prediction and explanation. Overestimation of SDMs performance and usefulness may be a common fact. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Predictive modelling of species' distributions is an important tool in biogeography, evolution, ecology, conservation, and invasive-species management. In this study we applied four different algorithms: Mahalanobis Distance, Domain, GARP and MAXENT, using them to predict the potential distribution of Limnoperna fortunei, a freshwater mussel native to Southeast Asia and a major fouling pest of water supply systems in Hong Kong, Japan, and South America. For model input, we compiled native and invaded occurrence data from Asia (71 points) and South America (248 points) from the literature and BIOCLIM's environmental layers related to air temperature and precipitation. To evaluate model quality we used different “training” and “test” data sets. On the Mahalanobis Distance and Domain algorithms, three sets of training data were used: 1) Asia points; 2) South America points; 3) Asia and South America points. For MAXENT the combinations were: 1) South America points (25{\%} test data/75{\%} training data); 2) Asia points (25{\%} test data/75{\%} training data); 3) South America training data/Asia test data; 4) Asia training data/ South America test data; 5) Asia + South America points (25{\%} test data/75{\%} training data). Comparing the responses of the four types of algorithms used, it was found that MAXENT was the most conservative model (i.e. it produced a smaller area of suitable habitats) followed in order by GARP, Domain and Mahalanobis Distance, which proved to be the widest. In general, the best results corresponded to models in which the points of occurrence covered a greater environmental variability (Asia+South America 25{\%} test data/75{\%} training data). They showed better performance for predicting correctly the occurrence of regions already known to host the species. An ensemble map was produced based on the best scenarios for each algorithm. This tool performed well in assessing the potential global distribution of L. fortunei even though it was generated from climatic macro variables without the use of locale-specific abiotic variables, which are more difficult to obtain. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s).

abstract = {We use two ecological niche modeling methods, Maxent and GARP, to model the potential distribution of emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis, EAB) in its invaded (Canada, USA) and native range (eastern Asia). For each algorithm (Maxent and GARP), we constructed three different models based on native or invaded data or a combination thereof. All GARP models yielded higher area under the curve (AUC) values and had therefore higher discriminatory power than the corresponding Maxent models, and the area predicted as suitable by GARP in North America was generally larger and included most infested sites even at the known range edges. In Asia, habitat suitability predicted by both algorithms was low and models trained with invaded coordinates did not transfer well to the native range. We found that none of the Maxent models provided a prediction precise enough for reliable risk assessment and the development of management plans, but a GARP model trained in the native range performed well when validated with data from the invaded range. Based on this GARP model, EAB may be able to extend its North American range further south, north and west covering roughly half (49{\%}) of the natural range of the most common affected ash species (Fraxinus americana, F. nigra, F. quadrangulata, and F. pennsylvanica). While our results demonstrate that native data may be useful for risk assessment of invasive species, a validation of early predictions based on these data is only possible with a time lag, which is lacking for most species. Due to uncertainties associated with ecological niche models for invaders, native data may not be sufficient at all times for long-term risk assessment. With regard to the latter, we recommend frequent re-evaluation of models based on more current monitoring. Combining ecological niche models with more mechanistic approaches based on experimental data may reduce uncertainty and improve risk assessment. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Our main contribution is to show that this intractability can be avoided as long as the constrained features possess a certain kind of low dimensional structure. In this case, we show that the associated partition function is symmetric and that this symmetry can be exploited to compute the partition function efficiently in a compressed form.

Its population has declined significantly, and the species has become locally endangered in recent decades. Understanding the habitat requirements of this species, evaluating habitat quality, and predicting its potential habitat are significant for protecting H. riparia Lour. One positional variable, three topographic variables and eight bioclimatic variables were used to model its distribution and potential habitat. The eight main bioclimatic variables influencing species distribution were selected from 19 bioclimatic variables based on correlation analysis and principal component analysis. An MAXENT model, because of the advantages of using presence-only data and performing well with incomplete data, small sample sizes and gaps, was employed to simulate the habitat suitability distribution. The results show that seven variables, namely, annual mean temperature, altitude, precipitation seasonality, precipitation of coldest quarter, the distance to the nearest river, temperature seasonality, and precipitation during the driest month, are significant factors determining H. riparia Lour's suitable habitat. Habitat suitability for three historical periods and two future climate warming scenarios were calculated.

The ability to use herbarium and museum collections to inform conservation decision-making can greatly enhance conservation efforts in biodiversity rich countries when human capacity and in-country data are limited. Guyana is used as a case study for landscape scale biodiversity assessment under such constraints. I compiled specimen records for seven taxon-groups (invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, ferns and non-seed plants, and seed plants), across the Guiana Shield, South America, to assess landscape scale biodiversity richness. Collector and taxonomic bias were addressed a priori in MaxEnt by generating a bias surface layer to down-weight areas of high collection intensity by smoothing the sampling distribution. I summed modeled output for each taxon-group to generate taxon-group specific floral, faunal, and all-taxa biodiversity density surfaces. These surfaces were used to (1) identify areas of relative high biodiversity density; (2) assess possible conservation areas; and (3) compare modeled areas of conservation interest with those proposed by the Government of Guyana. In addition, I compared proposed conservation sites with the location of indigenous (Amerindian) and non-indigenous settlements, and lands used for natural resource extraction. I present three conservation scenarios based on the all-taxa biodiversity surface: (i) biodiversity-only, (ii) biodiversity and available lands; and (iii) collaboration with indigenous peoples.

abstract = {Aim Studies of environmental niche shift/niche conservatism that are based on species distribution modelling require a quantification of niche purity and potential overlap. Although various metrics have been proposed for this task, no comparisons of their performance are available yet that express the linearity of range shifts and error-proneness. Herein, we assess the performance of six niche overlap metrics using three sister pairs of plethodontid salamanders as well as artificial species to test for linearity of overlap curves, impacts of varying potential distribution sizes and study area sizes. Location North America, artificial environments. Methods Species distribution models for the salamanders were performed with Maxent, and artificial species were created in the R environment. Potential distributions of species with varying range sizes and extents of the study area were compared using the Bray-Curtis distance BC, Schoener's D, two different modifications of the Hellinger distance I mod, I cor, Pianka's O and Horn's R. Niche overlaps in ecological space were compared using linear discriminant analyses based on principal components. Results Simulations of niche overlaps revealed strong variations in the performance of the niche overlap metrics. In artificial species, BC and D performed best, followed by O, R and I cor, but the modified Hellinger distance I mod showed a nonlinear slope and a truncated range. Furthermore, the simulations suggest that, in proportionally small potential distributions on large grids, an inclusion of a high proportion of grid cells with low occurrence probabilities representing background noise may bias assessments of niche overlaps. Main conclusions Both the salamander examples and simulations suggest that Schoener's D and the Bray-Curtis distance BC are best suited to compute niche overlaps from potential distributions derived from species distribution models. However, like all analysed metrics, both D and BC are seriously affected by the inclusion of high numbers of grid cells where the species are probably absent, i.e. with low occurrence probabilities. Therefore, pre-processing to eliminate background noise in the potential distribution grids is highly recommended. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Results suggest that the distribution model was excellent with training AUC value of 0.974 and test AUC value of 0.960 confirming the wide distribution of Sapindaceae in West Africa. Also, the environmental variables that affected the model the most are minimum temperature of the coldest month (35.4{\%}), precipitation of the coldest quarter (16.9{\%}) and precipitation of wettest month (14.9{\%}). Recommendations for different conservation strategies include in situ conservation in Protected Areas; ex situ conservation in seed banks and conservation through 'sustainable utilization'. {\textcopyright} 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract = {Aim : Data on geographical ranges are essential when defining the conservation status of a species, and in evaluating levels of human disturbance. Where locality data are deficient, presence-only ecological niche modelling (ENM) can provide insights into a species' potential distribution, and can aid in conservation planning. Presence-only ENM is especially important for rare, cryptic and nocturnal species, where absence is difficult to define. Here we applied ENM to carry out an anthropogenic risk assessment and set conservation priorities for three threatened species of Asian slow loris (Primates: Nycticebus). Location : Borneo, Java and Sumatra, Southeast Asia. Methods : Distribution models were built using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) ENM. We input 20 environmental variables comprising temperature, precipitation and altitude, along with species locality data. We clipped predicted distributions to forest cover and altitudinal data to generate remnant distributions. These were then applied to protected area (PA) and human land-use data, using specific criteria to define low-, medium- or high-risk areas. These data were analysed to pinpoint priority study sites, suitable reintroduction zones and protected area extensions. Results : A jackknife validation method indicated highly significant models for all three species with small sample sizes (n = 10 to 23 occurrences). The distribution models represented high habitat suitability within each species' geographical range. High-risk areas were most prevalent for the Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus) on Java, with the highest proportion of low-risk areas for the Bornean slow loris (N. menagensis) on Borneo. Eighteen PA extensions and 23 priority survey sites were identified across the study region. Main conclusions : Discriminating areas of high habitat suitability lays the foundations for planning field studies and conservation initiatives. This study highlights potential reintroduction zones that will minimize anthropogenic threats to animals that are released. These data reiterate the conclusion of previous research, showing MaxEnt is a viable technique for modelling species distributions with small sample sizes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

By using MaxEnt model and geographic information system (GIS), this paper analyzed the environmental variables affecting the distribution of E. philadelphicus, and intuitively and quantitatively predicted its potential distribution regions in China. The prediction was verified by the ROC curve, and the results showed that E. philadelphicus had a wide potential distribution range, with the main suitable distribution area in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi. At present, the actual invasive range of E. philadelphicus was far narrower than its potential maximum invasive range, and likely to be continued to spread. The ROC curve test indicated that the prediction with MaxEnt model had a higher precision, and was credible. Air temperature and precipitation could be the main environmental variables affecting the potential distribution of E. philadelphicus. More attentions should be addressed to the harmfulness of the weed. To eradicate the existing E. philadelphicus populations and to strictly monitor the invasion of E. philadelphicus to its most suitable distribution area could be the effective measures to prevent and control the further invasion of the alien weed.},

abstract = {Early studies within Algoa Bay, temperate South Africa, have predicted that coastal fish species with pelagic eggs spawn offshore. More recent studies on larval fish assemblages in the nearshore have shown that spawning may take place closer to shore based on the prevalence of preflexion larvae. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether species that are important from a fishery and ecological perspective are potentially spawning in Algoa Bay. Larval fish abundance data, from a mosaic of coastal habitats in Algoa Bay, were used to model (1) the spatial distribution of larvae and (2) the spawning location of species. A novel approach using a maximum entropy machine-learning algorithm to model larval distribution was coupled with reverse progressive vector plots (RPVPs) to predict potential spawning areas. The results demonstrated that larval fishes in the nearshore habitats of Algoa Bay exhibit species-specific spatial variability. Results from RPVPs indicate that larvae occurring at any location within Algoa Bay could be hatched and transported extensively within the bay before reaching a suitable size to swim independently of nearshore currents. The spawning of several important fishery species, namely Engraulis encrasicolus (Engraulidae), Sardinops sagax (Clupeidae) and Argyrosomus inodorus (Sciaenidae), was modelled in Algoa Bay. Our results indicate that spawning occurs closer to shore than what was previously thought. Eggs and larvae typically remained in close proximity to their spawning origin. Larval fish distributions, although variable amongst all study species, correspond to known adult distributions and potential reef habitats in the study region. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2016.},

abstract = {Background: Habitat selection is linked to a range of behavioral and non-habitat-related phenomena. The Snow Partridge (Lerwa lerwa) is a little known bird distributed along the Himalayas at high elevations in extreme habitat and a harsh climate. Unravelling the use of its habitat is important not only for understanding the ecology of this bird but also for its protection and conservation. Recent advances in modeling algorithms, in conjunction with the availability of environmental data, have made species distribution models (SDMs) widely accessible and used to predict available habitat and potential distributions. Methods: We conducted a field study at Balangshan mountains on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in west central China in August 2013. A line transect method and playback of recordings were used to survey suitable habitats. We established 20 m × 20 m plots at each flock location as well as control plots and measured 18 environmental variables. We used models of random forests to determine the micro-habitat variables that Snow Partridges might select, based on 25 presence and 27 absence locations and a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt ver. 3.3.3.e) to predict their distribution in three counties, i.e., Wenchuan, Xiaojin and Baoxing in Sichuan Province, with a total area of 12,800 km2, adjacent to our main study site. Results: We found a total of 13 flocks of the Snow Partridge in our study area on pyramidal peaks, ar{\^{e}}tes and steep rock slopes above 4430 m. The species is associated with habitats at the top of high cliffs or flatter terrain close to high cliffs, on more gentle slopes but still at high elevations. Terrain factors were the main factors affecting the selection of the micro-habitat by this partridge while vegetation is a more important factor at the meso-scale, with elevation as an important factor at both scales. Only 6.64{\%} of our study area had features that might provide a suitable habitat for the Snow Partridge. Conclusions: Movements of the Snow Partridge, covering elevations from 4400 to 4700 m, were significantly associated with their habitat selection, whether on a micro- or a meso-scale of the three counties. Scale effect is an obvious topographic factor affecting the birds to avoid predators at the micro-habitat level and vegetation structure at the meso-habitat level for accessing food. Post-breeding habitat selection seems a trade-off between food availability and predator avoidance. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Fire regimes are shifting worldwide because of global changes. The relative contribution of climate, topography and vegetation greatly determines spatial and temporal variations in fire regimes, but the interplay of these factors is not yet well understood. We introduce here a novel classification of fires according to dominant fire spread pattern, an approach considered in operational firefighting, to help understand regional-scale spatial variability in fire regimes. Here, we studied whether climate, topography and fuel variables allowed the prediction of occurrences from different fire spread patterns in Catalonia, NE Spain. We used a correlative modelling approach based on maximum entropy methods, and examined, through variation partitioning, the relative contribution of different factors on determining their occurrence. Our results accurately predicted the occurrence of different fire spread patterns, and the results were consistent when temporal validation was conducted. Although forest fuel factors made a higher contribution to the occurrence of convective fires, wind-driven fires were strongly related to topographic and climate factors. These findings may have a strong impact on investigations into how fire regimes may be projected into the future under forecast global change as they suggest that future environmental changes may affect different fire spread patterns in an idiosyncratic manner. {\textcopyright} IAWF 2015.},

Resource managers require a scientifically based methodology to balance energy development and species conservation, so we investigated modeling habitat suitability using Maximum Entropy to develop maps that could be used with other information to help site energy developments. We selected one species of concern, the Lesser Prairie-Chicken (LPCH; Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) found on the southern Great Plains of North America, as our case study. LPCH populations have been declining and are potentially further impacted by energy development. We used LPCH lek locations in the state of Kansas along with several environmental and anthropogenic parameters to develop models that predict the probability of lek occurrence across the landscape. The models all performed well as indicated by the high test area under the curve (AUC) scores (all {\textgreater}0.9). The inclusion of anthropogenic parameters in models resulted in slightly better performance based on AUC values, indicating that anthropogenic features may impact LPCH lek habitat suitability. Given the positive model results, this methodology may provide additional guidance in designing future survey protocols, as well as siting of energy development in areas of marginal or unsuitable habitat for species of concern. This technique could help to standardize and quantify the impacts various developments have upon at-risk species. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).},

We used predictive modelling to better understand the distribution of a critically endangered South African endemic (Hyperolius pickersgilli) and to guide conservation action. MaxEnt distribution models were produced based on limited occurrence data. Predicted localities with probability of occurrence ≥60{\%} were surveyed. Ten new sub-populations were discovered. The mean probability of occurrence for the species at wetlands where it was detected was greater than that at wetlands where it was not detected or absent. In addition, 17 known historical localities were re-visited and the species deemed absent at 8 of these. The total number of localities at which the species is now known to occur is 18, which is an increase in the known extant sub-populations of six. We recalculate the area of occupancy and extent of occurrence for the species as 108km2 and 2081.5km2, respectively; both increases on previous estimates. Implications of these changes on the IUCN Red List status of H. pickersgilli are discussed. A friction map was created to identify possible linkages between sub-populations, which can be used to guide habitat restoration and population repatriation. Given the degree of isolation of subpopulations and the potentially severe threats to most of these, urgent conservation action for H. pickersgilli remains crucial.

abstract = {Aim: To measure the effects of including biotic interactions on climate-based species distribution models (SDMs) used to predict distribution shifts under climate change. We evaluated the performance of distribution models for an endangered marsupial, the northern bettong (Bettongia tropica), comparing models that used only climate variables with models that also took into account biotic interactions. Location: North-east Queensland, Australia. Methods: We developed separate climate-based distribution models for the northern bettong, its two main resources and a competitor species. We then constructed models for the northern bettong by including climate suitability estimates for the resources and competitor as additional predictor variables to make climate + resource and climate + resource + competition models. We projected these models onto seven future climate scenarios and compared predictions of northern bettong distribution made by these differently structured models, using a 'global' metric, the I similarity statistic, to measure overlap in distribution and a 'local' metric to identify where predictions differed significantly. Results: Inclusion of food resource biotic interactions improved model performance. Over moderate climate changes, up to 3.0 °C of warming, the climate-only model for the northern bettong gave similar predictions of distribution to the more complex models including interactions, with differences only at the margins of predicted distributions. For climate changes beyond 3.0 °C, model predictions diverged significantly. The interactive model predicted less contraction of distribution than the simpler climate-only model. Main conclusions: Distribution models that account for interactions with other species, in particular direct resources, improve model predictions in the present-day climate. For larger climate changes, shifts in distribution of interacting species cause predictions of interactive models to diverge from climate-only models. Incorporating interactions with other species in SDMs may be needed for long-term prediction of changes in distribution of species under climate change, particularly for specialized species strongly dependent on a small number of biotic interactions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by the trypanosomatid parasite Leishmania infantum (=Leishmania chagasi), and is epidemiologically relevant due to its wide geographic distribution, the number of annual cases reported and the increase in its co-infection with HIV. Two vector species have been incriminated in the Americas: Lutzomyia longipalpis and Lutzomyia evansi. In Colombia, L. longipalpis is distributed along the Magdalena River Valley while L. evansi is only found in the northern part of the Country. Regarding the epidemiology of the disease, in Colombia the incidence of VL has decreased over the last few years without any intervention being implemented. Additionally, changes in transmission cycles have been reported with urban transmission occurring in the Caribbean Coast. In Europe and North America climate change seems to be driving a latitudinal shift of leishmaniasis transmission. Here, we explored the spatial distribution of the two known vector species of L. infantum in Colombia and projected its future distribution into climate change scenarios to establish the expansion potential of the disease. An updated database including L. longipalpis and L. evansi collection records from Colombia was compiled. Ecological niche models were performed for each species using the Maxent software and 13 Worldclim bioclimatic coverages. Projections were made for the pessimistic CSIRO A2 scenario, which predicts the higher increase in temperature due to non-emission reduction, and the optimistic Hadley B2 Scenario predicting the minimum increase in temperature. The database contained 23 records for L. evansi and 39 records for L. longipalpis, distributed along the Magdalena River Valley and the Caribbean Coast, where the potential distribution areas of both species were also predicted by Maxent. Climate change projections showed a general overall reduction in the spatial distribution of the two vector species, promoting a shift in altitudinal distribution for L. longipalpis and confining L. evansi to certain regions in the Caribbean Coast. Altitudinal shifts have been reported for cutaneous leishmaniasis vectors in Colombia and Peru. Here, we predict the same outcome for VL vectors in Colombia. Changes in spatial distribution patterns could be affecting local abundances due to climatic pressures on vector populations thus reducing the incidence of human cases. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Background: The impact of global climate change on plant distribution, speciation and extinction is of current concern. Examining species climatic preferences via bioclimatic niche modelling is a key tool to study this impact. There is an established link between bioclimatic niche models and phylogenetic diversification. A next step is to examine future distribution predictions from a phylogenetic perspective. We present such a study using Cyclamen (Myrsinaceae), a group which demonstrates morphological and phenological adaptations to its seasonal Mediterranean-type climate. How will the predicted climate change affect future distribution of this popular genus of garden plants? Results: We demonstrate phylogenetic structure for some climatic characteristics, and show that most Cyclamen have distinct climatic niches, with the exception of several wide-ranging, geographically expansive, species. We reconstruct climate preferences for hypothetical ancestral Cyclamen. The ancestral Cyclamen lineage has a preference for the seasonal Mediterranean climate characteristic of dry summers and wet winters. Future bioclimatic niches, based on BIOCLIM and Maxent models, are examined with reference to a future climate scenario for the 2050s. Over the next 50 years we predict a northward shift in the area of climatic suitability, with many areas of current distribution becoming climatically unsuitable. The area of climatic suitability for every Cyclamen species is predicted to decrease. For many species, there may be no areas with a suitable climate regardless of dispersal ability, these species are considered to be at high risk of extinction. This risk is examined from a phylogenetic perspective. Conclusion: Examining bioclimatic niches from a phylogenetic perspective permits novel interpretations of these models. In particular, reconstruction of ancestral niches can provide testable hypothesis about the historical development of lineages. In the future we can expect a northwards shift in climatic suitability for the genus Cyclamen. If this proves to be the case then dispersal is the best chance of survival, which seems highly unlikely for ant-dispersed Cyclamen. Human-assisted establishment of Cyclamen species well outside their native ranges offers hope and could provide the only means of dispersal to potentially suitable future environments. Even without human intervention the phylogenetic perspective demonstrates that major lineages could survive climate change even if many species are lost. {\textcopyright} 2006 Yesson and Culham; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Reintroductions of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the KwaZulu-Natal Province, through the managed metapopulation approach, promoted a population expansion fromone pack in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park in 1997 to nine packs in three reserves by 2009. Consequently, the likelihood of dispersing wild dogs leaving their natal ranges from within fenced reserves also increased. Land outside these reserves could potentially be utilized to expand wild dog distribution and provide connectivity between the geographically isolated subpopulations. We used Maximum Entropy Modelling (Maxent) to characterize habitat niche selection of transient wild dogs outside of resident reserves, and to identify potential dispersal linkages between subpopulations. A habitat suitability model indicated four variables (elevation, land cover, road density and human density) best predicted probability of presence for transient wild dogs. Elevation (AUC 0.80) and land cover (AUC 0.75) were the two most influential variables when considered independently.Transient wild dogs preferred lower lying locations (130-330ma.s.l.) covered by woodland or bushland; habitat indicative of the preferred prey of wild dogs. Considerable habitat exists for subpopulation linkages; however, the majority of wild dog movements between subpopulations required mitigation of potential or real game or livestock losses. Development of formal linkages and wild dog management between subpopulations will require a sustained approach to improving tolerance towards wild dogs, clarity on financial obligations and management responses to pack and prey population dynamics.},

abstract = {Species distribution modeling (SDM) is increasingly used to reveal biogeographical relationships, for example the sympatric range for species coexistence, and fundamental questions about niche evolution between related species. We explored the sympatric ranges between three Procapra species (Procapra przewalskii, Procapra Picti-caudata, and Procapra gutturosa) via two methods of defining the study region (method 1, in which models were developed in a larger region including the whole geographic range of Procapra, and method 2 in which a smaller region surrounding focal species' localities was used and then projected to the larger region). We also quantified environmental niche divergence between gazelles across the whole range in Procapra. Models for gazelles generally performed well. Compared with method 2, method 1 led to larger predicted areas with high suitability and was less concentrated around known localities. Clamping, which deals with variables outside the training range, varied between gazelles and occurred primarily in regions unsuitable for respective species. For all gazelle pairs, models revealed an overlap zone where more than one species should occur, while the estimates varied between the two methods. Moreover, we found that the niche overlap was closely associated with geographic distance but not with phylogenetic distance among gazelles. Our findings indicate that SDM is a useful tool for testing whether related species tend to be in sympatry at large scales, with method 1 leading to more realistic predictions for Procapra. This study provides evidence of a distinct niche divergence among related species and supports the theory that ecological speciation plays a significant role in lineage generation. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2012.},

abstract = {The Yelkouan shearwater (Puffinus yelkouan) is a vulnerable species endemic to the Mediterranean Region, but there is little information of its ecology particularly when at sea. In this study, we assessed the habitat use by Yelkouan shearwater in the Black Sea during the breeding (March-July) and non-breeding (August-February) periods of 2013, using boat-based surveys and shore-based counts. We created a species distribution model (SDM) based on the environmental variables that most accurately reflected the oceanographic habitat of this species in order to delineate foraging hotspots. Our habitat modelling analyses suggest that Yelkouan shearwaters respond to complex bio-physical coupling, as evidenced by their association with oceanographic variables. Foraging Yelkouan shearwaters mainly occurred on the western Black Sea continental shelf, indicating that Yelkouan shearwaters were foraging in shallow, cold and coastal waters. In the non-breeding period, Yelkouan Shearwater occurred beyond the Black Sea continental shelf, a wide pelagic extension of sea, indicating that shearwaters foraged in deep, warm and pelagic waters. These results are consistent with earlier studies, which identified the Black Sea as an important congregation site for Mediterranean Yelkouan shearwater populations outside the breeding season. This study demonstrates how the integration of boat-based survey data, shore-based counts and modelling can provide a wider understanding of the linkage between marine ecosystems that is mediated by marine megafauna such as pelagic seabirds. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

A peak of instability is observed when there are important differences in the factor comparing the bins of presence with the corresponding ones of extent.

abstract = {The presence of invasive species has been predicted using species distribution models (SDMs) and presence-only data to assist environmental management. However, SDMs include substantial uncertainty and the lack of absence data hampers the use of probabilistic predictions. A non-statistical theoretical basis able to deal with uncertainty on which to model invasive species distributions with presence-only data is thus needed. Fuzzy set theory satisfies these two requirements but has been little used. This paper proposes a fuzzy modelling approach for predicting invasive species potential distributions using presence-only data and SDMs to support the design of cost-effective monitoring schemes. The invasion of Gunnera tinctoria (Molina) Mirbel (Giant rhubarb) in the island of S{\~{a}}o Miguel (the Azores, Portugal) is used as case study. The latter involved the prediction of the potential distribution of the invader using MaxEnt and the selection of priority areas for monitoring the spread of the invader in case of scarcity of resources. In addition, MaxEnt was used within a traditional (non-fuzzy) approach, unable to quantity and report on uncertainty. The results of the fuzzy and non-fuzzy approaches are compared and their differences discussed, thus highlighting the potential benefits of using fuzzy set theory for species distribution modelling and management. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the homogenization setting, the effective properties of a heterogeneous material can be retrieved from the solution of the so-called corrector problem. In some cases of practical interest, obtaining such a solution remains a challenging computational task requiring an extremely fine discretization of microstructural features. In this context, Bignonnet et al. recently proposed a framework where smooth mesoscopic elasticity random fields are defined through a filtering procedure. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of information-theoretic random field models to accurately represent such mesoscopic elasticity fields. The aim is to substantially reduce the homogenization cost through the use of coarser discretizations while solving mesoscale corrector problems. The analysis is performed on a simple but non-trivial model microstructure. First of all, we recall the theoretical background related to the filtering and multiscale frameworks, and subsequently characterize some statistical properties of the filtered stiffness field. Based on these properties, we further introduce a random field model and address its calibration through statistical estimators and the maximum likelihood principle. Finally, the validation of the model is discussed by comparing some quantities of interest that are obtained either from numerical experiments on the underlying random microstructure or from model-based simulations. It is shown that for the case under study, the information-theoretic model can be calibrated with a limited set of realizations and still allows for accurate predictions of the effective properties. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is an alternate income source, especially in rural underdeveloped African settlements, and an important forest conservation incentive. However, dwindling honeybee colonies around the world are attributed to pests and diseases whose spatial distribution and influences are not well established. In this study, we used remotely sensed data to improve the reliability of pest ecological niche (EN) models to attain reliable pest distribution maps. Occurrence data on four pests (Aethina tumida, Galleria mellonella, Oplostomus haroldi and Varroa destructor) were collected from apiaries within four main agro-ecological regions responsible for over 80{\%} of Kenya's bee keeping. Africlim bioclimatic and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) variables were used to model their ecological niches using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt). Combined precipitation variables had a high positive logit influence on all remotely sensed and biotic models' performance. Remotely sensed vegetation variables had a substantial effect on the model, contributing up to 40.8{\%} for G. mellonella and regions with high rainfall seasonality were predicted to be high-risk areas. Projections (to 2055) indicated that, with the current climate change trend, these regions will experience increased honeybee pest risk. We conclude that honeybee pests could be modelled using bioclimatic data and remotely sensed variables in MaxEnt. Although the bioclimatic data were most relevant in all model results, incorporating vegetation seasonality variables to improve mapping the 'actual' habitat of key honeybee pests and to identify risk and containment zones needs to be further investigated. {\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors.},

abstract = {Gridded climatologies have become an indispensable component of bioclimatic modelling, with a range of applications spanning conservation and pest management. Such globally conformal data sets of historical and future scenario climate surfaces are required to model species potential ranges under current and future climate scenarios. We developed a set of interpolated climate surfaces at 10′ and 30′ resolution for global land areas excluding Antarctica. Input data for the baseline climatology were gathered from the WorldClim and CRU CL1{\textperiodcentered}0 and CL2{\textperiodcentered}0 data sets. A set of future climate scenarios were generated at 10′ resolution. For each of the historical and future scenario data sets, the full set of 35 Bioclim variables was generated. Climate variables (including relative humidity at 0900 and 1500hours) were also generated in CLIMEX format. The K{\"{o}}ppen-Geiger climate classification scheme was applied to the 10′ hybrid climatology as a tool for visualizing climatic patterns and as an aid for specifying absence or background data for correlative modelling applications. We tested the data set using a correlative model (MaxEnt) addressing conservation biology concerns for a rare Australian shrub, and a mechanistic niche model (CLIMEX) to map climate suitability for two invasive species. In all cases, the underlying climatology appeared to behave in a robust manner. This global climate data set has the advantage over the WorldClim data set of including humidity data and an additional 16 Bioclim variables. Compared with the CRU CL2{\textperiodcentered}0 data set, the hybrid 10′ data set includes improved precipitation estimates as well as projected climate for two global climate models running relevant greenhouse gas emission scenarios.

Our results indicate that long-term monitoring data usefully reflects the information entropy and trajectory in cone production. The entropy of cone production for longleaf pine forests at all sites increased slowly through time. However, a slight decrease in entropy was also noted. Entropy across all sites remained within 1.28-1.77 until 2016. High linear correlation existed between entropy and log (time length). The maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) overestimated the information entropy at each site, although the dynamics were similar.

abstract = {Field monitoring can vary from simple volunteer opportunistic observations to professional standardised monitoring surveys, leading to a trade-off between data quality and data collection costs. Such variability in data quality may result in biased predictions obtained from species distribution models (SDMs). We aimed to identify the limitations of different monitoring data sources for developing species distribution maps and to evaluate their potential for spatial data integration in a conservation context. Using Maxent, SDMs were generated from three different bird data sources in Catalonia, which differ in the degree of standardisation and available sample size. In addition, an alternative approach for modelling species distributions was applied, which combined the three data sources at a large spatial scale, but then downscaling to the required resolution. Finally, SDM predictions were used to identify species richness and high quality areas (hotspots) from different treatments. Models were evaluated by using high quality Atlas information. We show that both sample size and survey methodology used to collect the data are important in delivering robust information on species distributions. Models based on standardized monitoring provided higher accuracy with a lower sample size, especially when modelling common species. Accuracy of models from opportunistic observations substantially increased when modelling uncommon species, giving similar accuracy to a more standardized survey. Although downscaling data through a SDM approach appears to be a useful tool in cases of data shortage or low data quality and heterogeneity, it will tend to overestimate species distributions. In order to identify distributions of species, data with different quality may be appropriate. However, to identify biodiversity hotspots high quality information is needed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Materials and Methods: In this study, 54 georeferenced points for Tityus serrulatus and 86 points for Tityus bahiensis and eight environmental indicators, were used to generate species distribution models in Maxent (maximum entropy modeling of species geographic distributions) version 3.3.3k using 70{\%} of data for training (n=38 to T. serrulatus and n=60 to T. bahiensis) and 30{\%} to test the models (n=16 for T. serrulatus and n=26 for T. bahiensis). The logistic threshold used to cut models in converting the continuous probability model into a binary model was the "maximum test sensitivity plus specificity," provided by Maxent, with results of 0.4143 to T. serrulatus and of 0.3401 to T. bahiensis. The models were evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC), using the omission error and the binomial probability. With the data generated by Maxent, distribution maps were produced using the "ESRI{\textregistered} ArcGIS 10.2.2 for Desktop" software. Results: The models had high predictive success (AUC=0.7698±0.0533, omission error=0.2467 and p{\textless}0.001 for T. serrulatus and AUC=0.8205±0.0390, omission error=0.1917 and p{\textless}0.001 for T. bahiensis) and the resultant maps showed a high environmental suitability in the north, central, and southeast of the state, confirming the increasing spread of these species. The environmental variables that mostly contributed to the scorpions species distribution model were rain precipitation (28.9{\%}) and tree cover (28.2{\%}) for the T. serrulatus and temperature (45.8{\%}) and thermal amplitude (12.6{\%}) for the T. bahiensis. Conclusion: The distribution model of these species of medical importance scorpions in S{\~{a}}o Paulo State revealed a higher environmental suitability of these species in the regions north, central, and southeast of the state, warning to emergencies actions for prevention and surveillance from scorpion stings in several counties. There is also a need to best conservation strategies related to neighboring territories, with the implementation of new environmental protected areas and measures of spread control of these species in urban areas of several counties. {\textcopyright} The authors.},

abstract = {Brazilian peppertree, Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi (Anacardiaceae), a perennial woody plant native to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, has become one of the most invasive weeds in Florida. A leaflet pit galling psyllid, Calophya terebinthifolii Burckhardt {\&} Basset (Hemiptera: Calophyidae), has been identified as a potential biological control agent for Brazilian peppertree. However, biological information on the psyllid, including its life history, rearing procedures and potential distribution, is lacking. This type of information is essential when importing an insect for biological control purposes. From May-Aug 2009, field and laboratory research was conducted in Gaspar, Santa Catarina, Brazil with psyllids collected from the Atlantic coastal region of Santa Catarina. Laboratory studies on the psyllid in Brazil focused on: female fecundity (55.3 ± 8.9 eggs/female), the number and size of the immature stages, age-specific survivorship, and mean generation time (43.7 ± 1.2 days). Preliminary evidence from feeding trials suggests this psyllid from the Atlantic coastal region of Santa Catarina is locally adapted to Brazilian peppertree plants of haplotype A, which is one of the genetic types that invaded Florida. Ecological niche modelling with MaxEnt confirmed there was climatic overlap between Florida and the native range of the psyllid in South America. Using collection and survey locations of the psyllid in its native range and point locations for haplotype A plants in Florida, a map was created that predicted Volusia, coastal Pasco and Hernando counties, and a small section of southwestern Polk county as suitable locations for establishment of the psyllid if it is approved for release as a biocontrol agent.},

abstract = {It remains a challenge to identify the geographical patterns and underlying environmental associations of species with unique ecological niches and distinct behaviors. This in turn hinders our understanding of the ecology as well as effective conservation management of threatened species. The white-eared night heron (Gorsachius magnificus) is a non-migratory nocturnal bird species that has a patchy distribution in the mountainous forests of East Asia. It is currently categorized as "Endangered" on the IUCN Red List, primarily due to its restricted range and fragmented habitat. To improve our knowledge of the biogeography and conservation of this species, we modeled the geographical pattern of its suitable habitat and evaluated the potential impacts of climate change using ecological niche modeling with a maximum entropy approach implemented in Maxent. Our results indicated that the amount of suitable habitat in all of East Asia was about 130 000 km2, which can be spatially subdivided into several mountain ranges in southern and southwestern China and northern Vietnam. The extent of suitable habitat range may shrink by more than 35{\%} under a predicted changing climate when assuming the most pessimistic condition of dispersal, while some more suitable habitat would be available if the heron could disperse unrestrainedly. The significant future changes in habitat suitability suggested for Gorsachius magnificus urge caution in any downgrading of Red List status that may be considered. Our results also discern potentially suitable areas for future survey efforts on new populations. Overall, this study demonstrates that ecological niche modeling offers an important tool for evaluating the habitat suitability and potential impacts of climate change on an enigmatic and endangered species based on limited presence data. {\textcopyright} 2014 Hu, Liu.},

abstract = {Spatial management planning for vulnerable marine ecosystems (VME) across broad areas of un-sampled seafloor requires detailed predictions of species distribution. We utilised two habitat suitability modelling techniques, boosted regression trees (BRT) and maximum entropy (MaxEnt), to create potential distribution maps for 11 VME indicator taxa in the New Zealand area and adjacent seas. New bathymetry data were combined with existing environmental, chemical and physical data to produce a set of 45 predictor variables describing conditions at the seafloor. Nine of these variables were selected for use in the models based on low covariance and high explanatory power. Historical biological survey data were used to provide models with absence data (BRT) or target-group background data (MaxEnt). Model agreement was high, with each model predicting similar areas of suitable habitat both in the vicinity of known VME indicator taxa presence locations as well as across broad regions of un-sampled seafloor. Model performance measures, including cross-validation testing against sets of spatially independent data, did not clearly indicate a preferred modelling method across all taxa. Previous habitat suitability modelling efforts have rarely accounted for model precision, and in this study we used a bootstrap re-sampling technique to produce model uncertainty maps to accompany each habitat suitability map. Because of the similar performance of BRT and MaxEnt methods in this study, we conclude that the best approach to incorporating the results into decision-support tools for spatial conservation planning is to average predictions and uncertainty from both. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Chilean temperate forests are dominated by Nothofagus and Araucaria araucana species. Despite A. araucana not being at imminent risk of extinction, its cultural value and the associated environmental services and landscape goods have an important role for the conservation of this native forest. In some areas, the future conservation of A. araucana is a cause of great concern given its management prohibition and regeneration limitation due to slow growth, canopy tree competition and dense understory. The above characteristics make this species most susceptible to some disturbances, such as livestock, wildlife and human pressures. Therefore, sustainable management of A. araucana forests requires the assessment of its regeneration condition. The objective of this research was to apply multivariable analysis techniques in search of the most relevant parameter for Araucaria regeneration. This study used the following methods: principal component analysis (PCA), forward stepwise regression modeling and Maxent modeling. By PCA, it was possible to reduce the dimension to six-dimensional with a variance explanation of greater than 75{\%}. The multivariable regression model, known as model 7, was the best compromise between the coefficient of determination and model size (number of independent variables). Incorporating a maximum entropy trend improved model performance. A spatial prediction was obtained by summing the contributions of statistical methods and the geographic information system (GIS). The GIS increased the flexibility of the proposed model, which enabled an extrapolation to other areas at different spatial and temporal scales.},

In this study, we model distribution and map species richness of the 40 amphibian species from eastern Cuba with the objectives of identify hotspots, detect gaps in species representation in protected areas, and select additional areas to fill these gaps. We used two modeling methods, Maxent and Habitat Suitability Models, to reach a consensus distribution map for each species, then calculate species richness by combining specific models and finally performed gap analyses for species and hotspots. Our results showed that the models were robust enough to predict species distributions and that most of the amphibian hotspots were represented in reserves, but 50 percent of the species were incompletely covered and Eleutherodactylus rivularis was totally uncovered by the protected areas. We identified 1441 additional km2 (9.9{\%} of the study area) that could be added to the current protected areas, allowing the representation of every species and all hotspots. Our results are relevant for the conservation planning in other Caribbean islands, since studies like this could contribute to fill the gaps in the existing protected areas and to design a future network. Both cases would benefit from modeling amphibian species distribution using available data, even if they are incomplete, rather than relying only in the protection of known or suspected hotspots. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

abstract = {Nonnative, invasive plants are becoming increasingly widespread and abundant throughout the southwestern United States, leading to altered fire regimes and negative effects on native plant communities. Models of potential invasion are pertinent tools for informing regional management. However, most modeling studies have relied on occurrence data, which predict the potential for nonnative establishment only and can overestimate potential risk. We compiled locations of presence and high abundance for two problematic, invasive plants across the southwestern United States: red brome (Bromus rubens L.) and African mustard (Brassica tournefortii Gouan). Using an ensemble of five climate projections and two types of distribution model (MaxEnt and Bioclim), we modeled current and future climatic suitability for establishment of both species. We also used point locations of abundant infestations to model current and future climatic suitability for abundance (i.e., impact niche) of both species. Because interpretations of future ensemble models depend on the threshold used to delineate climatically suitable from unsuitable areas, we applied a low threshold (1 model of 10) and a high threshold (6 or more models of 10). Using the more-conservative high threshold, suitability for Bromus rubens presence expands by 12{\%}, but high abundance contracts by 42{\%}, whereas suitability for Brassica tournefortii presence and high abundance contract by 34{\%} and 56{\%}, respectively. Based on the low threshold (worst-case scenario), suitability for Bromus rubens presence and high abundance are projected to expand by 65{\%} and 64{\%}, respectively, whereas suitability for Brassica tournefortii presence and high abundance expand by 29{\%} and 28{\%}, respectively. The difference between results obtained from the high and low thresholds is indicative of the variability in climate models for this region but can serve as indicators of best-and worst-case scenarios. Nomenclature: Red brome, Bromus rubens L.; African mustard, Brassica tournefortii Gouan. Management Implications: In the arid and semiarid regions of the southwestern United States, two nonnative, invasive plant species, red brome (Bromus rubens L.) and African mustard (Brassica tournefortii Gouan) occur at varying levels of abundance. Within the study region (i.e., the area from which presence and high abundance data were collected), bioclimate envelope models (BEMs) indicate current widespread climatic suitability for the presence of both species. However, central and northwest Arizona, southern Nevada, and Baja California, Mexico, are currently most climatically suitable for high abundance of Bromus rubens. Hot, dry regions of southern California are currently most climatically suitable for high abundance of Brassica tournefortii. Based on a high threshold (6 or more of 10 models project suitability), climatic suitability is projected to increase only for Bromus rubens presence (+12{\%}), whereas climatic suitability for Brassica tournefortii presence could decrease (-34{\%}). Similarly, climatic suitability for high abundance of Bromus rubens (-42{\%}) and Brassica tournefortii (-56{\%}) could also decrease. For Brassica tournefortii, areas of contraction (i.e., projected loss of climatic suitability) appear in southern Arizona and California, and in Baja California and Sonora, Mexico. For high abundance of Bromus rubens, contraction is projected to occur along the southern edges of climatically suitable area, primarily in Arizona and Nevada. Climatic suitability for Brassica tournefortii is projected to contract mainly in western Nevada, southeastern California, and Baja California, Mexico. Based on an ensemble of future models and a low threshold (any 1 of 10 models projects suitability), climatic suitability for the presence of Bromus rubens and Brassica tournefortii could increase by up to 65{\%} and 29{\%}, respectively, by 2050. Climatic suitability for high abundance of Bromus rubens could expand northward into Nevada and Utah by up to 64{\%}, indicating that these areas might be at an elevated risk for impact from this species in the future. Area suitable for Brassica tournefortii high abundance could expand by up to 28{\%} by 2050 with slight increases in suitable area projected in southern Nevada, California, and Arizona. Efforts to minimize the impact of Bromus rubens and Brassica tournefortii would be more effective if focused on the areas identified as suitable for high abundance (rather than suitable for presence only) and likely to maintain or expand climatic habitat according to multiple projections. {\textcopyright} 2015 Weed Science Society of America.},

In the past two decades, there are considerable developments in understanding their biology and biogeography, among which, the distribution of Monotropa uniflora L. and M. hypopitys L. has been extensively studied. In this contribution, Ecological Niche Modeling of M. uniflora has been conducted to test its earlier proposed distribution in South Asia, to test the spatial scale of the said proposal, to test its potential distribution as a surrogate for range of Monotropoideae in South Asia and to prioritize conservation areas for M. uniflora in the region. The model was built with five occurrence details of the rare plant M. uniflora in Western and Eastern Himalaya, in relation to 19 bioclimatic explanatory variables, performed in MaxEnt. The results show the good performance of the model with the training AUC of 0.994. 1,50,316 square Km. of suitable areas have been predicted for the growth of M. uniflora (IHS ≥0.5) in South Asia, many areas of which is in line with earlier distributional reports. The bioclimatic variables are able to predict and suitably justify the spatial distribution of M. uniflora. The predicted range of the species could be established for potential distribution of other Asian Monotropoids like Monotropastrum and Cheilotheca. {\textcopyright} 2015 Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

We used the maximum entropy model to assess the vulnerability of giant panda to climate change in the Qinling Mountains of China. The results of modeling included the following findings: (1) the area of suitable habitat for giant pandas was projected to decrease by 281 km2 from climate change by the 2050s; (2) the mean elevation of suitable habitat of giant panda was predicted to shift 30 m higher due to climate change over this period; (3) the network of nature reserves protect 61.73{\%} of current suitable habitat for the species, and 59.23{\%} of future suitable habitat; (4) current suitable habitat mainly located in Chenggu, Taibai, and Yangxian counties (with a total area of 987 km2) was predicted to be vulnerable. Assessing the vulnerability of giant panda provided adaptive strategies for conservation programs and national park construction. We proposed adaptation strategies to ameliorate the predicted impacts of climate change on giant panda, including establishing and adjusting reserves, establishing habitat corridors, improving adaptive capacity to climate change, and strengthening monitoring of giant panda. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {Gully erosion is one of the most severe environmental problems in large areas of Iran. Land degradation and accelerated desertification are the consequence in susceptible areas. Gully erosion normally takes place when surface runoff is concentrated and thus, detach and transfer soil particles down the slopes into the drainage network. In traditional soil erosion studies these processes often have been neglected. In this study we investigate the spatial distribution of gully erosion processes with a quantitative method since in many national assessment approaches just qualitative models were applied. For this study we utilized a detailed terrain analysis and a stochastic modeling approach using mechanical statistics. Moreover we predict the potential spatial distribution of gullies in the Mazayejan plain of Fars province in southwestern Iran where gully erosion is the main environmental threat. Our methodological approach consists in the following steps: i) mapping of gully erosion phenomena in a test area based on Google Earth images; ii) development of a digital elevation model (DEM) with 10 meter resolution, iii) detailed terrain analysis deriving more than 20 terrain indices, iv) application of the Maxent model for the test area using the gully erosion forms as dependent variable and topographic indices as predictor variable and finally v) prediction of the spatial distribution of gully erosion potential for the entire study area. Model performance was evaluated by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). The results obtained show that the Maxent model perform very well and thus, it is suitable for the prediction of the gully erosion potential in the area. Among the terrain indices utilized in the prediction the most important ones are: convergence index, plan curvature, and slope. The proposed methodology allows conducting a proper gully erosion assessment in order to identify the priority areas for soil conservation and land use management.},

abstract = {The criteria and categories of the IUCN red list can be applied to any taxonomic unit, including taxa below species level or non-formally described forms, but this is seldom practiced. Because conservation priorities largely focus on well-established taxa that deserve urgent action, cryptic species may be facing a critical situation. This could be the case for some Andean and trans-Andean populations of Pyrrhura parakeets in Colombia that have restricted and isolated geographic ranges, and whose conservation status has been overlooked because nominal species covering them are considered of a "Least Concerna". As part of research into the biogeographic history and biogeographic patterns of the genus Pyrrhura, we used MaxEnt modelling to make a first approach to the geographic distribution and conservation status of these populations, and to determine if they could be considered independent conservation units. As with other members of Pyrrhura, we found that their climatic niche was restricted to humid regions of the Andes and the Andean foothills, resulting in isolated and discontinuous distributions associated with the Tropical humid forest Zonobiome. Comparing our estimates of area of occupancy with the established thresholds for IUCN criterion B2, the four subspecies studied could be considered threatened. The small geographic ranges, apparent vulnerability to forest fragmentation compared with other parrots, and extensive habitat loss experienced by the Andean and trans-Andean subspecies of P. melanura and P. picta allow us to conclude that they are valid conservation units. Although further research on these taxa is necessary, our results imply that they must be included as target populations in local and national policies for management plans and decision making, and urgent actions are needed for the subspecies of P. picta such as P. p. subandina and P. p. caeruleiceps. {\textcopyright} 2011 BirdLife International.},

In concordance with DV predictions we studied that (i) these amphibians display a natural distribution gap in central Amazonia; (ii) east of this gap they constitute a monophyletic lineage which is nested within a pre-Andean/western clade; (iii) climate envelopes of Atelopus west and east of the distribution gap show some macroclimatic divergence due to a regional climate envelope shift; (iv) geographic distributions of climate envelopes of western and eastern Atelopus range into central Amazonia but with limited spatial overlap. We tested if presence and apparent absence data points of Atelopus were homogenously distributed with Ripley's K function. A molecular phylogeny (mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene) was reconstructed using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference to study if Guianan Atelopus constitute a clade nested within a larger genus phylogeny. We focused on climate envelope divergence and geographic distribution by computing climatic envelope models with MaxEnt based on macroscale bioclimatic parameters and testing them by using Schoener's index and modified Hellinger distance. We corroborated existing DV predictions and, for the first time, formulated new DV predictions aiming on species' climate envelope change. Our results suggest that cool-adapted Andean Atelopus ancestors had dispersed into the Amazon basin and further onto the eastern Guiana Shield where, under warm conditions, they were forced to change climate envelopes. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Climate change can profoundly alter species' distributions due to changes in temperature, precipitation, or seasonality. Migratory monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) may be particularly susceptible to climate-driven changes in host plant abundance or reduced overwintering habitat. For example, climate change may significantly reduce the availability of overwintering habitat by restricting the amount of area with suitable microclimate conditions. However, potential effects of climate change on monarch northward migrations remain largely unknown, particularly with respect to their milkweed (Asclepias spp.) host plants. Given that monarchs largely depend on the genus Asclepias as larval host plants, the effects of climate change on monarch northward migrations will most likely be mediated by climate change effects on Asclepias. Here, I used MaxEnt species distribution modeling to assess potential changes in Asclepias and monarch distributions under moderate and severe climate change scenarios. First, Asclepias distributions were projected to extend northward throughout much of Canada despite considerable variability in the environmental drivers of each individual species. Second, Asclepias distributions were an important predictor of current monarch distributions, indicating that monarchs may be constrained as much by the availability of Asclepias host plants as environmental variables per se. Accordingly, modeling future distributions of monarchs, and indeed any tightly coupled plant-insect system, should incorporate the effects of climate change on host plant distributions. Finally, MaxEnt predictions of Asclepias and monarch distributions were remarkably consistent among general circulation models. Nearly all models predicted that the current monarch summer breeding range will become slightly less suitable for Asclepias and monarchs in the future. Asclepias, and consequently monarchs, should therefore undergo expanded northern range limits in summer months while encountering reduced habitat suitability throughout the northern migration. {\textcopyright} 2015 Nathan P.

abstract = {The small geographical range of highly endemic species is an important factor to be considered in conservation initiatives because it can increase their risk of extinction, as well decrease their probability of discovery. In this study, we use environmental niche modeling (ENM) to investigate the distribution of Brachycephalus, an anuran genus characterized by microendemic species living mostly in montane habitats along the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. Given that traditional ENM is not possible in the case of Brachycephalus because most of its species have limited geographical ranges, we analyzed an ensemble dataset that combined records of most described species, as well as new species that are currently being described, while accounting for heterogeneity in their climatic niches. Niche heterogeneity was quantified by ordination of the bioclimatic variables associated with their occurrence records, followed by unguided clustering of the resulting ordination scores. Out of an initial dataset of 544 records, careful curation reduced it to 75 records of 24 species and 71 localities. Interestingly, the three major clusters of climatic niches found in Brachycephalus corresponded largely to the three previously recognized phylogenetic lineages in the genus. The pernix cluster included the highly endemic species from southern Brazil that were most restricted to high-elevation areas, whereas the didactylus cluster encompassed species with broader geographical ranges that extended into lowland regions of the Atlantic Rainforest. Finally, the ephippium cluster included species from southeastern Brazil with intermediate levels of endemism. The detection of several isolated locations with potentially suitable habitats indicate that the diversity of Brachycephalus could still be considerably underestimated. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Ecological niche model (ENM) generally takes mechanistic (or physiological) form and estimates the species distribution based on causal factors (e.g. rainfall or sunlight). Data for such causal factors are difficult or expensive to collect and are frequently in small quantity. Terrain-related variables are used as proxy of causal factors, since topographic data can be easily acquired by remote sensing. Taiwan red cypress (TRC) often form pure forests and grow in fog-forest belt (FFB) with rich moisture carried by northeastern season wind (NESW). TRCs grow in the north of study area, but almost do not grow in the Huisun Experimental Forest Station (HEFS) in the south of study area. The study attempted to determine if the NESW blocked by topographic obstacles is a key to this distribution by reversely thinking the positive effect of topographic shelters associated with Taiwan fir in Hohuan Mountains. Topographic sheltering index (TSI) was developed and ENMs were built by maximum entropy (MAXENT) with combinations of elevation, TSI, slope, and vegetation index. The absence of TRC forests in most FFB areas of the HEFS is shown to be attributable to the adverse effects of mountain ranges in the northeast of the study area. The model with elevation plus TSI is the best among ENMs. This indicates that predictors currently used in models, except elevation and TSI, are useless for explaining abovementioned distribution, and TSI can help to explain it. Moreover, the greater the TSI, the fewer TRC trees grow, especially in HEFS. TSI can improve model performance; however, the improvement is relatively limited. Hence, further refined TSI (progressive lessening of the NESW as the latitude decreases from northern to central Taiwan and multiple topographic sheltering effects), the proxy of solar radiation (SR), and highresolution DEM will be included into ENMs to greatly improve their predictions.},

abstract = {The purpose of spatial modelling in animal and public health is three-fold: describing existing spatial patterns of risk, attempting to understand the biological mechanisms that lead to disease occurrence and predicting what will happen in the medium to long-term future (temporal prediction) or in different geographical areas (spatial prediction). Traditional methods for temporal and spatial predictions include general and generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM) and Bayesian estimation methods. However, such models require both disease presence and absence data which are not always easy to obtain. Novel spatial modelling methods such as maximum entropy (MAXENT) and the genetic algorithm for rule set production (GARP) require only disease presence data and have been used extensively in the fields of ecology and conservation, to model species distribution and habitat suitability. Other methods, such as multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), use knowledge of the causal factors of disease occurrence to identify areas potentially suitable for disease. In addition to their less restrictive data requirements, some of these novel methods have been shown to outperform traditional statistical methods in predictive ability (Elith et al., 2006). This review paper provides details of some of these novel methods for mapping disease distribution, highlights their advantages and limitations, and identifies studies which have used the methods to model various aspects of disease distribution. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Most of the Earth's biodiversity resides in the tropics. However, a comprehensive understanding of which factors control range limits of tropical species is still lacking. Climate is often thought to be the predominant range-determining mechanism at large spatial scales. Alternatively, species' ranges may be controlled by soil or other environmental factors, or by non-environmental factors such as biotic interactions, dispersal barriers, intrinsic population dynamics, or timelimited expansion from place of origin or past refugia. How species ranges are controlled is of key importance for predicting their responses to future global change. Here, we use a novel implementation of species distribution modelling (SDM) to assess the degree to which African continental-scale species distributions in a keystone tropical group, the palms (Arecaceae), are controlled by climate, non-climatic environmental factors, or non-environmental spatial constraints. A comprehensive data set on African palm species occurrences was assembled and analysed using the SDM algorithm Maxent in combination with climatic and non-climatic environmental predictors (habitat, human impact), as well as spatial eigenvector mapping (spatial filters). The best performing models always included spatial filters, suggesting that palm species distributions are always to some extent limited by non-environmental constraints. Models which included climate provided significantly better predictions than models that included only non-climatic environmental predictors, the latter having no discernible effect beyond the climatic control. Hence, at the continental scale, climate constitutes the only strong environmental control of palm species distributions in Africa. With regard to the most important climatic predictors of African palm distributions, water-related factors were most important for 25 of the 29 species analysed. The strong response of palm distributions to climate in combination with the importance of nonenvironmental spatial constraints suggests that African palms will be sensitive to future climate changes, but that their ability to track suitable climatic conditions will be spatially constrained. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {We identified several ecological parameters that may promote the foraging habitat differentiation by sympatric bat species. The exploitation of discrete habitats was shown to facilitate the coexistence of morphologically similar species. Bats represent a model species group, where many morphologically similar species exploit similar resources, e.g. insects as prey organisms. We studied three closely related species of bats in a Central European region of sympatric occurrence - the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), Nathusius' pipistrelle (P. nathusii), and the soprano pipistrelle (P. pygmaeus). We employed point locality data and niche-based species distribution modelling (maximum entropy modelling, 'MaxEnt') to model the habitat use by these species. A restricted distribution of P. pygmaeus and P. nathusii compared to P. pipistrellus was observed that may indicate a stronger habitat specialization of these two species compared to P. pipistrellus. Land cover, as well as several climatic variables influenced the habitat use of all three species (e.g., the precipitation in spring, and the temperature minimum in late summer). Despite an overlap in foraging habitat parameters, differences among species concerning their preferred habitat were noted. Responses to isothermality, mean diurnal range of temperature, temperature seasonality, and land cover differed among species. The data identify microclimatic factors, besides vegetation and other land cover types, as important effectors for habitat partitioning in these three Pipistrellus species. {\textcopyright} Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.},

abstract = {The quality of climate models has largely been overlooked as a possible source of uncertainty that may affect the outcomes of species distribution models, especially in the tropics, where comparatively few climatic stations are available. We compared the geographical discrepancies and potential conservation implications of using two different climate models (Saga and Worldclim) in combination with the species modelling approach Maxent in Bolivia. We estimated ranges of selected bird and fern species biogeographically restricted to either humid montane forest of the northern Bolivian Andes or seasonal dry tropical forests (in the Andes and southern lowlands). Saga and Worldclim predicted roughly similar climate patterns of temperature that were significantly correlated. Precipitation layers of both climate models were also roughly similar, but showed important differences. Species ranges estimated with Worldclim and Saga likewise produced different results. Ranges of species endemic to humid montane forests estimated with Saga had higher AUC (Area under the curve) values than those estimated with Worldclim, which for example predicted the occurrence of humid montane forest bird species near Lake Titicaca, an area that is clearly unsuitable for these species. Likewise, Worldclim overpredicted the occurrence of fern and bird species in the lowlands of the Chapare region and well south of the Andean Elbow, where more seasonal biomes occur. By contrast, Saga predictions were coherent with the known distribution of humid montane forests in the northern Bolivian Andes. Estimated ranges of species endemic to seasonal dry tropical forests predicted with Saga and Worldclim were not statistically different in most cases. However, detailed comparisons revealed that Saga was able to distinguish fragments of seasonal dry tropical forests in rain-shadow valleys of the northern Bolivian Andes, whereas Worldclim was not. These differences highlight the neglected influence of climate layers on modelling results and the importance of using the most accurate climate data available when modelling species distributions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We investigate the phylogeny, biogeography, time of origin and diversification, ancestral area reconstruction and large-scale distributional patterns of an ancient group of arachnids, the harvestman suborder Cyphophthalmi. Analysis of molecular and morphological data allow us to propose a new classification system for the group; Pettalidae constitutes the infraorder Scopulophthalmi new clade, sister group to all other families, which are divided into the infraorders Sternophthalmi new clade and Boreophthalmi new clade. Sternophthalmi includes the families Troglosironidae, Ogoveidae, and Neogoveidae; Boreophthalmi includes Stylocellidae and Sironidae, the latter family of questionable monophyly. The internal resolution of each family is discussed and traced back to its geological time origin, as well as to its original landmass, using methods for estimating divergence times and ancestral area reconstruction. The origin of Cyphophthalmi can be traced back to the Carboniferous, whereas the diversification time of most families ranges between the Carboniferous and the Jurassic, with the exception of Troglosironidae, whose current diversity originates in the Cretaceous/Tertiary. Ancestral area reconstruction is ambiguous in most cases. Sternophthalmi is traced back to an ancestral land mass that contained New Caledonia and West Africa in the Permian, whereas the ancestral landmass for Neogoveidae included the south-eastern USA and West Africa, dating back to the Triassic. For Pettalidae, most results include South Africa, or a combination of South Africa with the Australian plate of New Zealand or Sri Lanka, as the most likely ancestral landmass, back in the Jurassic. Stylocellidae is reconstructed to the Thai-Malay Penisula during the Jurassic. Combination of the molecular and morphological data results in a hypothesis for all the cyphophthalmid genera, although the limited data available for some taxa represented only in the morphological partition negatively affects the phylogenetic reconstruction by decreasing nodal support in most clades. However, it resolves the position of many monotypic genera not available for molecular analysis, such as Iberosiro, Odontosiro, Speleosiro, Managotria or Marwe, although it does not place Shearogovea or Ankaratra within any existing family. The biogeographical data show a strong correlation between relatedness and formerly adjacent landmasses, and oceanic dispersal does not need to be postulated to explain disjunct distributions, especially when considering the time of divergence. The data also allow testing of the hypotheses of the supposed total submersion of New Zealand and New Caledonia, clearly falsifying submersion of the former, although the data cannot reject the latter. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract = {China was attacked by a serious influenza A (H7N9) virus in 2013. The first human infection case was confirmed in Shanghai City and soon spread across most of eastern China. Using the methods of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and ecological niche modeling (ENM), this research quantitatively analyzed the relationships between the H7N9 occurrence and the main environmental factors, including meteorological variables, human population density, bird migratory routes, wetland distribution, and live poultry farms, markets, and processing factories. Based on these relationships the probability of the presence of H7N9 was predicted. Results indicated that the distribution of live poultry processing factories, farms, and human population density were the top three most important determinants of the H7N9 human infection. The relative contributions to the model of live poultry processing factories, farms and human population density were 39.9{\%}, 17.7{\%} and 17.7{\%}, respectively, while the maximum temperature of the warmest month and mean relative humidity had nearly no contribution to the model. The paper has developed an ecological niche model (ENM) that predicts the spatial distribution of H7N9 cases in China using environmental variables. The area under the curve (AUC) values of the model were greater than 0.9 (0.992 for the training samples and 0.961 for the test data). The findings indicated that most of the high risk areas were distributed in the Yangtze River Delta.

abstract = {Aim: To investigate the impact of geographical bias on the performance of ecological niche models for invasive plant species. Location: South Africa and Australia. Methods: We selected 10 Australian plants invasive in South Africa and nine South African plants invasive in Australia. Geographical bias was simulated in occurrence records obtained from the native range of a species to represent two scenarios. For the first scenario (A, worst-case) a proportion of records were excluded from a specific region of a species' range and for the second scenario (B, less extreme) only some records were excluded from that specific region of the range. Introduced range predictions were produced with the M. axent modelling algorithm where models were calibrated with datasets from these biased occurrence records and 19 bioclimatic variables. Models were evaluated with independent test data obtained from the introduced range of the species. Geographical bias was quantified as the proportional difference between the occurrence records from a control and a biased dataset, and environmental bias was expressed as either the difference in marginality or tolerance between these datasets. Model performance [assessed using the conventional and modified AUC (area under the curve of receiver-operating characteristic plots) and the maximum true skill statistic] was compared between models calibrated with occurrence records from a biased dataset and a control dataset. Results: We found considerable variation in the relationship between geographical and environmental bias. Environmental bias, expressed as the difference in marginality, differed significantly across treatments. Model performance did not differ significantly among treatments. Regions predicted as suitable for most of the species were very similar when compared between a biased and control dataset, with only a few exceptions. Main conclusions: The geographical bias simulated in this study was sufficient to result in significant environmental bias across treatments, but despite this we did not find a significant effect on model performance. Differences in the environmental spaces occupied by the species in their native and invaded ranges may explain why we did not find a significant effect on model performance. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim With climate change, reliable predictions of future species geographic distributions are becoming increasingly important for the design of appropriate conservation measures. Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to predict geographic range shifts in response to climate change. However, because species communities are likely to change with the climate, accounting for biotic interactions is imperative. A shortcoming of introducing biotic interactions in SDMs is the assumption that biotic interactions remain the same under changing climatic factors, which is disputable. We explore the performance of SDMs while including biotic interactions. Location Fennoscandia, Europe. Methods We investigate the appropriateness of the inclusion of biotic factors (predator pressure and prey availability) in assessing the future distribution of the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) in Fennoscandia by means of SDM, using the algorithm MaxEnt. Results Our results show that the inclusion of biotic interactions enhanced the accuracy of SDMs to predict the current arctic fox distribution, and we argue that the accuracy of future predictions might also be enhanced. While the range of the arctic fox is predicted to have decreased by 43{\%} in 2080 because of temperature-related variables, projected increases in predator pressure and reduced prey availability are predicted to constrain the potential future geographic range of the arctic fox in Fennoscandia 13{\%} more. Main conclusions The results indicate that, provided one has a good knowledge of past changes and a clear understanding of interactions in the community involved, the inclusion of biotic interactions in modelling future geographic ranges of species increases the predictive power of such models. This likely has far-reaching impacts upon the design and implementation of possible conservation and management plans. Control of competing predators and supplementary feeding are suggested as necessary management actions to preserve the Fennoscandian arctic fox population in the face of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The Brazilian Cerrado is a biome of great biodiversity, but detailed information about the diversity and distribution of species in this region is still insufficient for both testing ecological hypotheses and for conservation purposes. Among native plants in the Cerrado, Dipteryx alata Vogel (commonly known as the "Baru" tree), has a high potential for exploitation. The aims of this paper were to predict the potential spatial distribution of D. alata in the Brazilian Cerrado utilising five different niche modelling techniques. These techniques usually provide distinct results, so it may be difficult to choose amongst them. To adjust for this uncertainty, we employ an ensemble forecasting approach to predict the spatial distribution of the Baru tree. We accumulated a total of 448 occurrence points and modelled the subsequent predicted occurrences using seven climatic variables. Five different presence-only ecological niche modelling techniques (GARP, Maxent, BIOCLIM, Mahalanobis Distance and Euclidean Distance) were used and the performance of these models was compared using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and the Area Under the Curve (AUC). All models presented AUC values higher than 0.68, and GARP presented the highest AUC value, whereas Euclidean Distance presented the lowest. The ensemble forecasting approach suggested a high suitability for the occurrence of the Baru tree in the Central-Western region of the Brazilian Cerrado. Our study demonstrated that modelling species distribution using ensemble forecasting can be an important computational tool for better establishing sampling strategies and for improving our biodiversity knowledge to better identify priority areas for conservation. For the Baru tree, we recommend priority actions for conservation in the central region of the Cerrado Biome.},

abstract = {Background: The redescription of Platymeris rhadamanthus Gerstaecker, 1873 as well as the designation of lectotype and paralectotype, plus the prediction of the potentially suitable habitat was the main goal of this study. Our research were based on 262 specimens of museum collections of P. rhadamanthus species and a set of 23 environmental predictor variables, all recorded in a 1×1 km grid covering Africa. Ecological niche modelling was performed using the MAXENT analyses to produce predictive potential distribution maps for this species and its colour forms separately. Results: The results suggested the most suitable areas of distribution of P. rhadamanthus, both for species as a whole and also for the colour forms. A jackknife test showed that the precipitation of coldest quarter and herbaceous vegetation were the most important environmental variables affecting the distribution of P. rhadamanthus. After analyzing the climatic preferences, this species seems to be related mainly to the tropical savanna climate, subtropical highland variety of the oceanic climate and humid subtropical climate. An analysis of environmental variables also showed that this species prefers areas with herbaceous vegetation, with a small participation of trees, which is probably caused by food preferences of its victims. Conclusions: P. rhadamanthus so far was only known that it occurs in widely understood tropical Africa. On the base of the museum data on the occurrence of the species and ecological niche modelling methods we provided new and valuable information of the potentially suitable habitat, the possible range of distribution of the species and its climatic preferences. {\textcopyright} 2014 2h{\l}ond and Bugaj-Nawrocka; licensee Springer.},

abstract = {In the development of a species distribution model based on regression techniques such as generalized linear or additive modelling (GLM/GAM), a basic assumption is that records of species presence and absence are real. However, a common concern in many studies examining species distributions is that absences cannot be inferred with certainty. This is particularly the case where the species is rare, difficult to detect and/or does not occupy all available habitat considered suitable. The western ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris) of southern Western Australia, Australia, is a case in point, as not only is it rare and difficult to detect, but it is also unlikely to occupy all available suitable habitat. A recent survey of ground parrots provided the opportunity to develop a predictive distribution model. As the data were susceptible to false absences, these were replaced with randomly selected 'pseudo' absences and modelled using GLM. As a comparison, presence-only information was modelled using a relatively new approach, MAXENT, a machine-learning technique that has been shown to perform comparatively well. The predictive performance of both models, as assessed by the receiver operating characteristic plot (ROC) was high (AUC {\textgreater} 0.8), with MAXENT performing only marginally better than the GLM. These approaches both indicated that the ground parrot prefers areas relatively high in altitude, distant from rivers, gently sloping to level habitat, with an intermediate cover of vegetation and where there is a mosaic of vegetation ages. In this case, the use of presence-only information resulted in the identification of important environmental attributes defining the occurrence of the ground parrot, but additional factors that account for the inability of the bird to occupy all suitable habitat should be a component of model refinement. {\textcopyright} 2007 Department of Environment and Conservation.},

We show that the main factor associated with platypus occurrence switched from aquatic habitat availability (estimated by rainfall) to thermal tolerances (estimated by annual maximum temperature) in the 1960s. This correlates directly with the change in the annual maximum temperature anomaly from cooler to warmer conditions in southeastern Australia. Modelling of platypus habitat under emission scenarios (A1B, A2, B1 and B2) revealed large decreases ({\textgreater}30{\%}) in thermally suitable habitat by 2070. This reduction, compounded by increasing demands for water for agriculture and potable use, suggests that there is real cause for concern over the future status of this species, and highlights the need for restoration of thermal refugia within the platypus' modelled range. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The use of species distribution models (SDMs) to predict potential distributions of species is steadily increasing. A necessary assumption when projecting models throughout space or time is that climatic niches are conservative, but recent findings of niche shifts during biological invasion of particular plant and animal species have indicated that this assumption is not categorically valid. One reason for observed shifts may relate to variable selection for modelling. In this study, we assess differences in climatic niches in the native and invasive ranges of the Greenhouse frog (Eleutherodactylus planirostris). We analyze which variables are more 'conserved' in comparison to more 'relaxed' variables (i.e. subject to niche shift) and how they influence transferability of SDMs developed with Maxent on the basis of ten bioclimatic layers best describing the climatic requirements of the target species. We focus on degrees of niche similarity and conservatism using Schoener's index and Hellinger distance. Significance of results are tested with null models. Results indicate that the degrees of niche similarity and conservatism vary greatly among the predictive variables. Some shifts can be attributed to active habitat selection, whereas others apparently reflect variation in the availability of climate conditions or biotic interactions between the frogs' native and invasive ranges. Patterns suggesting active habitat selection also vary among variables. Our findings evoke considerable implications on the transferability of SDMs over space and time, which is strongly affected by the choice and number of predictors. The incorporation of 'relaxed' predictors not or only indirectly correlated with biologically meaningful predictors may lead to erroneous predictions when projecting SDMs. We recommend thorough assessments of invasive species' ecology for the identification biologically meaningful predictors facilitating transferability. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Understanding the pattern-process relations of land use and land cover change is an important area of research that provides key insights into human-environment interactions. The suitability or likelihood of occurrence of land use such as agricultural crop types across a human-managed landscape is a central consideration. Recent advances in niche-based geographic species distribution models (SDMs) offer a novel approach to understanding land suitability and land use decisions. SDMs link species presence and location data with geospatial information and use machine learning algorithms to develop nonlinear and discontinuous species-environment relationships. Here, we apply the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model for land suitability modeling by adapting niche theory to a human-managed landscape. In this article, we use data from an agricultural district in northeastern Thailand as a case study for examining the relationships among the natural, built, and social environments and the likelihood of crop choice for the commonly grown crops that occur in the Nang Rong District-cassava, heavy rice, and jasmine rice, as well as an emerging crop, fruit trees. Our results indicate that although the natural environment (e.g., elevation and soils) is often the dominant factor in crop likelihood, the likelihood is also influenced by household characteristics, such as household assets and conditions of the neighborhood or built environment. Furthermore, the shape of the land use-environment curves illustrates the noncontinuous and nonlinear nature of these relationships. This approach demonstrates a novel method of understanding nonlinear relationships between land and people. The article concludes with a proposed method for integrating the niche-based rules of land use allocation into a dynamic land use model that can address both allocation and quantity of agricultural crops. {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Identification of biodiversity rich areas prone to large-scale plant invasion and their prioritisation is vital for targeting prevention and control programmes. Recent availability of field inventoried forest native and forest invasive species (FIS) data from a nation-wide biodiversity project in India, has served as a valuable source of information for conservation prioritization. Our approach considers prioritisation of phytogeographic areas based on congruence of spatial pattern of phytorichness distribution and spatial pattern of potential spread of hotspots of multiple FIS. We modelled native phytorichness at landscape scale following a three-tier methodology of mapping of habitat types, field sampling of vascular plants and spatial modelling with landscape matrices for central Indian landscape in India. The hotspots of multiple FIS were modelled with occurrences of 98 species, and optimally chosen environmental covariates using MaxEnt. We then integrated phytorichness and FIS invasion hotspots information to identify priority zones (high, medium and low) for informed policy decisions for conservation actions. Study emphasises that potential hotspots of invasive species should be considered for conservation priority setting. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

This is the case in the Grosseto province, located in the southern part of Tuscany, Italy. Anticipating where predator attacks are likely to occur can help focus mitigation efforts. We suggest a three-step method to predict wild canid depredation risk using presence only data on wild canid detections and confirmed depredation events in the study area. We obtained the probability of occurrence for canids and depredation events based on ecological variables and then performed an ensemble model following an ad-hoc procedure. We compared models' outputs obtained from two different approaches to species distribution modeling: Maximum Entropy (Maxent) and Bayesian for Presence-only Data (BPOD) testing their ability to predict the occurrence of events. The ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) was used to assess the importance of each environmental variable in the description of the presence points. Forested areas were identified as the most important attribute predicting wild canid occurrence. Livestock predation was most likely to occur close to farms where sheep densities were higher and more accessible. Higher depredation risk zones were characterized by proximity to forested areas and the presence of landscape features that allowed wild canids to reach pastures with minimum effort such as the network of smaller watercourses. Only 15{\%} of the total sheep farms fall within higher risk areas, indicating that depredation was facilitated by environmental conditions (e.g. closeness to the woods) rather than the availability of prey. Overall BPOD performed better than Maxent in terms of sensitivity, suggesting that BPOD could be a promising approach to predict probability of occurrence using presence only data. {\textcopyright} 2017 Associazione Teriologica Italiana.},

The sea pen Funiculina quadrangularis and the habitat associated with two further sea pen species, Virgularia mirabilis and Pennatula phosphorea, are of key conservation importance and are recommended for protection within MPAs. This study models their potential distributions using the MAXimum ENTropy algorithm and assesses these in relation to five possible marine protected areas (pMPAs) proposed for Scottish waters. Metrics relevant to assessing the efficacy of MPAs are also presented. Four environmental variables of prime importance for predicting the presence of all three species of sea pen were identified: mud, minimum salinity, depth, and gravel. The habitat suitability index increased with mud content. The modelled distribution of F. quadrangularis indicated a deeper distribution than V. mirabilis or P. phosphorea and was not present in sediment with gravel content above 30{\%}. Pennatula phosphorea had the smallest area of suitable habitat, while V. mirabilis had the largest. The percentage predicted suitable area for each species that was encompassed by the five pMPAs ranged from 11{\%} for F. quadrangularis to 15{\%} for P. phosphorea. Some of the largest areas predicted as suitable for F. quadrangularis lay outside the pMPAs. The model results indicated differences in the environmental requirements of the three species of sea pen that can be linked to the autecology of each species. Patch sizes, calculated from a binary output of the model, were used to estimate the degree of habitat fragmentation, thereby giving a partial assessment of the adequacy criterion for these pMPAs. The results suggest that potential MPAs within the study area cover sizeable areas of potential sea pen habitat. However, further areas suitable for F. quadrangularis could be considered. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

We used aerial survey and satellite-linked Global Positioning System (GPS) collar data for elephants, to test (i) whether there is an optimal spatial resolution of predictor variables at which habitat models based on aerial survey data that are uncorrected for locational error can accurately predict elephant habitat and (ii) whether habitat models based on these data sets can accurately predict the presence of elephants in closed woodland habitats. We applied maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) to these data sets and used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as well as distance from water points as the habitat predictors to answer these questions. Our results demonstrate better ability of aerial survey data to predict elephant presence at the coarser spatial resolution of 1000 m of both predictor variables. Habitat models derived from aerial survey data underpredicted elephant presence in more closed woodland habitats than those derived from GPS collar data. This result implies that elephants located under dense tree canopies are likely missed during an aerial survey. Our study is one of the first to empirically test and report results on the poor performance of aerial survey data in habitat modelling especially in dense woodlands. 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

Species distribution models (SDM) have been widely used to predict geographic and climatic ranges of species. Geoffroy's cat Leopardus geoffroyi is a small felid of least concern that occupies a wide variety of habitat types in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. We evaluated the fine-scale distribution of Geoffroy's cat at the sub-continental level, estimated its current extent and area of occurrence and discussed the current and potential ranges developed with SDM. On the basis of species occurrences (n = 1502) and large-scale environmental data, two model types ('environmental' and 'land cover') were developed using MaxEnt. The estimated extent of occurrence of Geoffroy's cat was 3 180 664 km2, but the potential area of occurrence predicted by our environmental model was 70{\%} larger due to areas with high suitability (i.e. {\textgreater}0.5) compared to the species' current range. The most important bioclimatic factors affecting Geoffroy's cat presence were temperature seasonality, mean temperature of the coldest quarter and annual precipitation. Two recent records obtained outside the known distribution of the species fell within the high-suitability area (i.e. {\textgreater}0.5) predicted by our model. Our SDM suggest that this habitat-generalist felid is probably expanding its distribution range by taking advantage of changes in human land use. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Zoological Society of London.},

To inform the management of feral peafowl, we aimed to (1) provide an estimate of peafowl distribution and abundance; (2) measure peafowl home ranges; (3) calculate the area of suitable peafowl habitat; and (4) estimate how the population could change under various culling scenarios. Using expert and landholder surveys, we estimated that ∼380 individuals (range 330-428) were distributed among 21 separate groups on Kangaroo Island. Habitat suitability modelling identified native vegetation near agriculture as the preferred peafowl habitat and indicated that substantial unoccupied suitable habitat is available. The mean home range of eight peafowl was 52ha and one dispersal event of 4.5km demonstrated that unoccupied suitable habitat could feasibly be colonised. Demographic models indicated that, if unmanaged, the peafowl population could exceed 2000 individuals after 10 years, but that culling ∼85 individuals annually could maintain the current population size. We therefore suggest that control of the Kangaroo Island peafowl population is warranted while the current distribution of peafowl is well understood. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2016.},

abstract = {Aim: It is widely acknowledged that species distributions result from a variety of biotic and abiotic factors operating at different spatial scales. Here, we aimed to (1) determine the extent to which global climate niche models (CNMs) can be improved by the addition of fine-scale regional data; (2) examine climatic and environmental factors influencing the range of 15 invasive aquatic plant species; and (3) provide a case study for the use of such models in invasion management on an island. Location: Global, with a case study of species invasions in Ireland. Methods: Climate niche models of global extent (including climate only) and regional environmental niche models (with additional factors such as human influence, land use and soil characteristics) were generated using maxent for 15 invasive aquatic plants. The performance of these models within the invaded range of the study species in Ireland was assessed, and potential hotspots of invasion suitability were determined. Models were projected forward up to 2080 based on two climate scenarios. Results: While climate variables are important in defining the global range of species, factors related to land use and nutrient level were of greater importance in regional projections. Global climatic models were significantly improved at the island scale by the addition of fine-scale environmental variables (area under the curve values increased by 0.18 and true skill statistic values by 0.36), and projected ranges decreased from an average of 86{\%} to 36{\%} of the island. Main conclusions: Refining CNMs with regional data on land use, human influence and landscape may have a substantial impact on predictive capacity, providing greater value for prioritization of conservation management at subregional or local scales. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {The paper presents a distribution free method for estimating the quantile function of a non-negative random variable using the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) subject to constraints specified in terms of the probability-weighted moments estimated from observed data. Traditionally, MaxEnt is used for estimating the probability density function under specified moment constraints. The density function is then integrated to obtain the cumulative distribution function, which needs to be inverted to obtain a quantile corresponding to some specified probability. For correct modelling of the distribution tail, higher order moments must be considered in the analysis. However, the higher order ({\textgreater}2) moment estimates from a small sample of data tend to be highly biased and uncertain. The difficulty in obtaining accurate moment estimates from small samples has been the main impediment to the application of the MaxEnt Principle in extreme quantile estimation. The present paper is an attempt to overcome this problem by the use of probability-weighted moments (PWMs), which are essentially the expectations of order statistics. In contrast with ordinary statistical moments, higher order PWMs can be accurately estimated from small samples. By interpreting the PWM as the moment of quantile function, the paper derives an analytical form of quantile function using MaxEnt principle. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to assess the accuracy of MaxEnt quantile estimates computed from small samples. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Syzygium travancoricum Gamble. a critically endangered plant in southern Western Ghats of India was considered to examine the role of pseudo-absence and modeling algorithms in endemic species niche formulation. This aided in reassessing IUCN status emphasizing on geographical distribution. Seven different modeling algorithms were attempted considering different sets of pseudo-absence points through BIOMOD2 program in R and MaxEnt. The outputs were compared with the extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO), as done in conservation status assessment exercise by IUCN. Modeling algorithm and pseudo-absence points play an important role in model development. Ensemble methods displayed wider variations in outputs despite having good statistical performance thus emphasizing on importance of multiple algorithm trials for data deficient taxa. Both model and topology based methods have shown much higher values for EOO and AOO which contradict it's critically endangered status; thus, suggesting re-evaluation of the threat status with comprehensive field investigation. {\textcopyright} 2017 by International Journal of Ecology {\&} Development.},

abstract = {North America species of cattails including Typha latifolia, Typha angustifolia, and Typha domigensis, are an important component of marsh ecosystems and are often dominant among emergent wetland vegetation. Typha ssp are considered invasive due of their ability to take over marshes and freshwater environment and form dense, nearly monotypic, stands of vegetation. For decades many of Typha physiological characteristics contributing to cattails expansion (size, growth habitat characteristics, reproduction mode, etc) have been studied and explored. Very few studies, however, have been conducted that investigate the actual extent of their distributions across the continent and the primary ecological drivers for their spatial distributions. In this study we model, at a continental and regional scale, the spatial distributions of three species of cattails (T. latifolia, T. angustifolia, and T. domingensis) across North America using maximum entropy and evaluate each of the environmental input layers for their respective contributions to the overall spatial distributions of each species. Differences were observed in Typha spp. predicted distribution at continental and regional scale. Temperature, solar radiation, and ground frost frequency were primary drivers of Typha distributions. The accuracy of the predicted distributions, and relative impact of environmental input variables, will depend on the relevance on environmental variables.},

abstract = {The earth is now facing the land degradation due to human disturbance, natural habitats were converted to rural and agricultural areas in order to fulfill the increasing demand of human population. The deforestation of Picea crassifolia (Qinghai spruce) forest at Qilian Mts is an example of such disturbance. P. crassifolia is an ecologically and hydrologically important plant species in the northwestern arid area of China. However, the forests have been intensively and extensively deforested. In order to restore the human-disturbed ecosystems, the spatial distribution of P. crassifolia needs to be delineated. This study employed Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction model (GARP) and Maximum entropy model (Maxent) and four environmental variables (mean temperature of the warmest quarter, precipitation of the wettest quarter, annual solar radiation, topographic wetness index) to predict the potential distribution of P. crassifolia in Qilian Mts. Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction model (GARP) produces a model of species niches in geographic space based on heterogeneous rule-sets. Maximum entropy model (Maxent) focuses on fitting a probability distribution for occurrence based on the idea that the best explanation to unknown phenomena will maximize the entropy of the probability distribution, subject to the appropriate constraints. The environmental variables were spatially interpolated throughout the entire study area. We used sensitivity-specificity sum maximum approach to select the threshold value. The projected niche space for the mean temperature of the warmest quarter is between 8.5 and 18.1°C; the space for the precipitation of the wettest quarter is between 149 and 245 mm; the space for annual solar radiation is 118-1100×103 wh m-2 and the space for topographic wetness index is between -0.4 and 5.1. The results show that both GARP and Maxent's models produce acceptable predictions, but the overall comparison shows that GARP prediction is better than Maxent's; the comparison between the observed distribution and the predicted distribution suggests that 61{\%} (2869 km2) of P. crassifolia forests have been deforested.},

Population monitoring is required to ensure effective management and appropriate allocation of conservation resources; however, deriving estimates of population metrics such as density within heterogeneous environments is challenging. We aimed to quantify the population density and spatial distribution of buffy-tufted-ear marmosets (Callithrix aurita) in the northern region of Serra-do-Mar State Park. We incorporated habitat suitability as quantified by a niche modeling algorithm (MAXENT) to refine density estimates obtained via distance methods. We used 6 environmental predictors to model the distribution of Callithrix aurita and used the resulting MAXENT niche model to identify environmental conditions that represent suitable habitat for this species. We used 877.7 km of line transect surveys and distance methods to derive estimates of 2.19 groups or 7.55 individuals/km2 from direct observations (n = 40), providing an overall population estimate of 1892 (95{\%} CI = 1155-3068) individuals in 250.7 km2 of Atlantic forest. Our refined density estimate, obtained by combining distance methods and a niche model, yielded a result of 1386 individuals. Suitable habitat was not uniformly distributed across the study area and was most strongly associated with altitude and the type of vegetation cover. We provide a review of previous surveys and find this is the largest known population of Callithrix aurita. Our refinement of density estimates provides a simple and informative addition to the primatologist's toolbox. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are important tools to explore the effects of future global changes in biodiversity. Previous studies show that variability is introduced into projected distributions through alternative datasets and modelling procedures. However, a multi-model approach to assess biogeographic shifts at the global scale is still rarely applied, particularly in the marine environment. Here, we apply three commonly used SDMs (AquaMaps, Maxent, and the Dynamic Bioclimate Envelope Model) to assess the global patterns of change in species richness, invasion, and extinction intensity in the world oceans. We make species-specific projections of distribution shift using each SDM, subsequently aggregating them to calculate indices of change across a set of 802 species of exploited marine fish and invertebrates. Results indicate an average poleward latitudinal shift across species and SDMs at a rate of 15.5 and 25.6 km decade-1 for a low and high emissions climate change scenario, respectively. Predicted distribution shifts resulted in hotspots of local invasion intensity in high latitude regions, while local extinctions were concentrated near the equator. Specifically, between 10°N and 10°S, we predicted that, on average, 6.5 species would become locally extinct per 0.5° latitude under the climate change emissions scenario Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. Average invasions were predicted to be 2.0 species per 0.5° latitude in the Arctic Ocean and 1.5 species per 0.58 latitude in the Southern Ocean. These averaged global hotspots of invasion and local extinction intensity are robust to the different SDM used and coincide with high levels of agreement. {\textcopyright} International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014.

In this work, we delimited the distribution area and we discuss the category of threat of the species in Colombia. For this, we used a niche modelling approach using the Maximun Entropy (Maxent) algorithm. Using Geographical Information Systems, we highlighted areas in which the species is protected. Our results show that the Andean fox can be found potentially from Nari{\~{n}}o until Huila departments (8,877 km2), and the National System of Protected Areas in Colombia protected 1,742 km2 (19.6{\%}) of the potential distribution of the species. Despite the species is considered Vulnerable in Colombia, we found that it does not meet the criteria for allocation in that category, due to the absence of tangible evidence that supported a population decline, decreased in area of occupancy, or habitat quality in the decade prior to the risk assessment. Considering the validated records and information on the distribution area of the species in Colombia, we suggest a re-assignation of the category to the category Near Threatened (NT). {\textcopyright} 2016, Fundacao Zoobotanica do Rio Grande do Sul.

abstract = {Understanding the spatial scale and temporal pattern of disease incidence is a fundamental prerequisite for the development of appropriate management and intervention strategies. It is particularly critical, given the need to understand the elevated risks linked to climate change, to allow the most likely changes in the distribution of parasites and disease vectors to be predicted under a range of climate change scenarios. Using statistical models, the spatial distribution and climatic correlates of a range of parasites and diseases have been mapped previously, but their development into dynamic, predictive tools is less common. The aim of the work described here, was to use a species distribution model to characterise the environmental determinants of the monthly occurrence of ovine cutaneous myiasis (blowfly strike) by Lucilia sericata, the most frequent primary agent of northern European myiasis, and to then use this model to describe the potential spatial changes that might be expected in response to predicted climate change in Great Britain. The model predicts that the range of elevated temperatures predicted by current climate change scenarios will result in an increase in the risk of strike and an elongated blowfly season. However, even for the most rapid warming scenario predictions over the next 70. years, strike is not predicted to occur throughout the winter. Nevertheless, in this latter case, parts of central and southern England are likely to become too hot and dry for strike by L. sericata, to persist in mid-summer. Under these conditions, it is possible that other, more pathogenic Mediterranean agents of myiasis, such as Wolfhartia magnifica, could potentially replace L. sericata. Where the phenology of strike is altered by climate change, as predicted here, significant changes to the timing and frequency of parasite treatments and husbandry practices, such as shearing, will be required to manage the problem. The results suggest that the modelling approach adopted here could be usefully applied to a range of disease systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.},

The modelling was done using Maxent, one of the best-performing presence-only modelling techniques, using various thresholds to convert the estimated suitability values into predicted presence or absence. Distribution models for each individual species were overlaid to predict species richness and composition, which were then compared to the observed values for well-surveyed grid cells.

Using species' occurrences and climatic, topographic, and remotely sensed vegetation variables we developed potential distribution models at two scales: (1) broad geographic scale (northern South America), based on georeferenced occurrences obtained from literature and natural history museum specimens, and (2) local scale, based on precise occurrences (GPS coordinates) recorded in the field (Caverna do Maroaga Protected Area, Amazonas, Brazil). We identified six priority areas for the conservation of the cock-of-the-rock corresponding to high environmental suitability and lowest anthropogenic pressure, measured as distance from urban areas and highways ({\textgreater}5 km). Protecting the areas identified in this study from anthropogenic threats such as hunting and selective logging will help to preserve not only the cock-of-the-rock, but also the biodiversity of the whole mosaic of habitats in the region. Our results were incorporated in a regional management plan developed by state agencies and non-governmental organizations.

Maximum entropy method (Maxent) was employed to generate models using a set of environmental variables as explanatory variables of the location records obtained by sighting and accidental captures. All ecological niche models performed returned AUC values {\textgreater}. 0.9. Areas with high environmental suitability for pantropical spotted dolphin (. Stenella attenuata), Clymene dolphin (. Stenella clymene) and spinner dolphins (. Stenella longirostris) are found in warm ({\textgreater}. 25. °C) and deep waters (≥. 1000. m). High environmental suitability for Atlantic spotted dolphin (. Stenella frontalis) seems to occur between 20.5°S and 30°S in the southeastern Brazilian coastal waters. The projected maps of species distributions showed patterns closely related to environmental changes at a fine spatial scale and added valuable information about the offshore limits of those oceanic species. The results suggest that the different species of Stenella have distinct environmental requirements in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Alpine ecosystems occur under extreme climatic conditions and, as a result, house a unique and vulnerable biota. They are very scarce at tropical latitudes; in Mexico occur mainly along the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, where species richness is not high but narrow endemics stand out. We investigate the effects of climate change under hypothesized contrasting climate warming scenarios using ecological niche modeling of five microendemic alpine species. Occurrence data was obtained mainly from field trips, but herbaria were also examined. A total of 21 climatic and topographic variables, as well as individual selections of 12–16 variables were employed to construct models with Maxent and GARP. Depending on the number of occurrences, current models were validated with Partial-ROC or Jackknife procedures; and projections to 2050 and 2070 were made using two Representative Concentration Pathways and two Global Circulation Models. All species' models showed a clear pattern of contraction under the explored scenarios; over 58 {\%} of contemporary climatic distribution disappeared, suggesting that analyzed species face imminent extinction due to climatic habitat loss. The models are useful in representing the endemic component of Mexican alpine grassland by reciprocal correspondence in geographic distribution, and we consider it as a highly endangered ecosystem due to climate change, which is probably applicable to other tropical alpine ecosystems. The Pico de Orizaba volcano seems the best option to preserve due to its extension and elevation. However, further studies at finer scales are needed to improve in situ preservation and conservation strategies that include translocation, assisted migration and seed banking. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {One of the available tools for mapping the geographical distribution and potential suitable habitats is species distribution models. These techniques are very helpful for finding poorly known distributions of species in poorly sampled areas, such as the tropics. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) is a recently developed modeling method that can be successfully calibrated using a relatively small number of records. In this research, the MaxEnt model was applied to describe the distribution and identify the key factors shaping the potential distribution of the vulnerable Malayan Sun Bear (Helarctos malayanus) in one of the main remaining habitats in Peninsular Malaysia. MaxEnt results showed that even though Malaysian sun bear habitat is tied with tropical evergreen forests, it lives in a marginal threshold of bio-climatic variables. On the other hand, current protected area networks within Peninsular Malaysia do not cover most of the sun bears potential suitable habitats. Assuming that the predicted suitability map covers sun bears actual distribution, future climate change, forest degradation and illegal hunting could potentially severely affect the sun bear's population. {\textcopyright} 2012 Nazeri et al.},

Analysis was performed on a record set of 71 localities, including literature records and 34 new localities reported here. The bioclimatic profile was characterized through extreme, median and dispersion features of the values of 19 bioclimatic variables across the record set. Predictive models were built with the presence-only methods MAXENT and, secondarily, BIOCLIM. Disco- cyrtus testudineus is a typical Mesopotamian harvestman, spreading across a wide region along the middle and lower Parana River in subtropical/temperate Argentina, and extending, more or less continuously, up to the central province of Cordoba. Apparently diverging records (Paso de los Libres, on the Uruguay River, and Quilmes, on the southern coast of Rio de la Plata) proved to be predictable, even if suppressed from the dataset. Comparisons of cumulative frequencies curves and dispersion features (box-plots) were made with Discocyrtus dilatatus Sorensen, 1884 and Gryne orensis (So- rensen, 1884), other Mesopotamian species for which bioclimatic data are available. The relative importance of the bio- climatic variables used for modeling was also estimated. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 Magnolia Press.},

During the last years, ecological niche modelling has been increasingly applied to predict the current distribution of disease vectors and their potential responses to climate change. However, sandflies and their transmitted diseases are only scarcely investigated via niche modelling. Here, we propose a methodological approach to combine specific dispersal pathways for a sandfly species (Phlebotomus perniciosus) with the shifting climatic niche in the face of climate change. Current climatic suitability for the species was determined. Future projection is based on data of a regional climate change model. We defined a cost-surface assigned by the changing climatic suitability and expert knowledge on species dispersal ability. The derived travel costs correspond to the effort for the species to move across the landscape to climatically suitable habitats. In future steps, least-cost paths will be calculated for this and further sandfly species with assumed spreading tendencies to Central Europe in the 21 st century. Challenges are the integration of wind speed and biotic interactions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Biodiversity loss, including the decrease of diversity of ecological interactions, is known to reduce the capacity of ecosystems to cope with the effects of global change. Here we assessed whether the distribution and survival of two declining relict plant species, Daphne rodriguezii and Cneorum tricoccon, were affected by the mutualism disruption with their only seed-disperser and by climatic and habitat conditions. Due to the lack of data on demographic rates, we used an indirect approach to test these hypotheses. We used presence-absence data as response variables and took two distinct sets of predictors (i.e. habitat and topoclimatic conditions), which were hypothesized to be the main determinants of the demographic rates under question. With these two datasets we fitted species distribution models by means of MaxEnt. Such models were later used to build Combined Species Distributions Models (CM). For each plant species, these CM allowed evaluating the role of both climatic and non-climatic factors, such as the mutualism disruption. Results showed that both climate and habitat conditions determined the current distribution of the two species at a landscape scale. Additionally, the mutualism disruption between C. tricoccon and its native seed-disperser affected plant distribution, moving it to areas where a new alien disperser was present. This alien disperser modified the pattern of habitat selection by plants in terms of habitat quality, reducing their presence in suboptimal areas, which might be the determinant for their survival. Our findings highlight the need of a better understanding of the role of mutualisms within natural communities in order to undertake appropriate conservation actions on threatened plant populations. Furthermore, acting on key factors affecting plant-disperser disruptions (e.g. controlling invasive species) might help to mitigate the effects of global change on declining relict plants. {\textcopyright} 2015 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

abstract = {Background: Triatoma virus (TrV) is the only entomopathogenous virus identified in triatomines. We estimated the potential geographic distribution of triatomine species naturally infected by TrV, using remotely sensed and meteorological environmental variables, to predict new potential areas where triatomines infected with TrV may be found. Methods: Detection of TrV infection in samples was performed with RT-PCR. Ecological niche models (ENM) were constructed using the MaxEnt software. We used 42 environmental variables derived from remotely sensed imagery (AVHRR) and 19 bioclimatic variables (Bioclim). The MaxEnt Jackknife procedure was used to minimize the number of environmental variables that showed an influence on final models. The goodness of fit of the model predictions was evaluated by the mean area under the curve (AUC). Results: We obtained 37 samples of 7 species of triatomines naturally infected with TrV. Of the TrV positive samples, 32{\%} were from sylvatic habitat, 46{\%} came from peridomicile habitats and 22{\%} from domicile habitats. Five of the seven infected species were found only in the sylvatic habitat, one species only in the domicile and only Triatoma infestans was found in the three habitats. The MaxEnt model estimated with the Bioclim dataset identified five environmental variables as best predictors: temperature annual range, mean diurnal range, mean temperature of coldest quarter, temperature seasonality and annual mean temperature. The model using the AVHRR dataset identified six environmental variables: minimum Land Surface Temperature (LST), minimum Middle Infrared Radiation (MIR), LST annual amplitude, MIR annual amplitude annual, LST variance and MIR variance. The potential geographic distribution of triatomine species infected by TrV coincides with the Chaco and the Monte ecoregions either modelled by AVHRR or Bioclim environmental datasets. Conclusions: Our results show that the conditions of the Dry Chaco ecoregion in Argentina are favourable for the infection of triatomine species with TrV, and open the possibility of its use as a potential agent for the biological control of peridomestic and/or sylvatic triatomine species. Results identify areas of potential occurrence that should be verified in the field. {\textcopyright} 2015 Ceccarelli et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

Geographic origin data of genebank and herbarium specimens and climatic data of the origin locations were used as input. For Lactuca saligna, we varied the input data by omitting the specimens from different parts of the known distribution area to assess the robustness of the predicted distributions. Furthermore, we examined the accuracy of the modelling by comparing the predicted probabilities of population presence against recent expedition data for the endemic Lactuca georgica and the cosmopolitan Lactuca serriola. We found Maxent to be quite robust in its predictions, although its usefulness was higher for endemic taxa than for more widespread species. The exclusion of occurrence data from the perceived range margins of the species can result in important information about local adaptation to distinct climatic conditions.

abstract = {Open-source species locality data are widely used in species distribution modeling but may be spatially biased by uneven sampling effort across a species' range. Spatial biases may vary across ecological trait groups if traits affect associations with landscape features and capture probability. Furthermore, spatial biases may change across time as research priorities, funding, and methodologies change, which may confound modeling of temporal changes in distributions. We used locality records from 93 bat species from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to characterize the differential contribution of bias variables to spatial bias and how contribution varied across ecological trait groups. Next, we examined how historical changes in protected area proliferation, economic development, and sampling method advancement affected protected area and university biases. Roosting and foraging traits influenced spatial bias, but distance to protected areas was the greatest contributor to spatial sampling bias in a pooled model and 8 out of 10 ecological trait group models. Over time, distance to protected areas significantly decreased following protected area proliferation, but economic improvement did not influence distance to universities. Sampling method advancements increased protected area bias for two out of three foraging groups. Although sampling effort has increased over time, effort is becoming more biased towards protected areas, which may not encompass the entirety of species' ranges or allow for equal sampling across taxa. Characterizing spatial bias differences among species and across time clarifies underlying causes of spatial bias, information that can be leveraged to improve spatial bias correction. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Currently, P. varaldii is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List due to a multitude of threats, while its distribution is partially unknown and fragmented. The current study addresses distribution, threats and the potential niche using ecological niche modelling, while emphasizing conservation strategies and immediate actions. The distribution of P. varaldii can be divided into four disjunct areas, at least two of which consist of small populations. The largest threats to P. varaldii include the transformation of habitat and breeding ponds into agricultural and industrial areas, the pollution of breeding ponds due to extensive livestock pasturing and the possible expansion of Procambarus sp. into the Mamora cork oak forest. Additional threats constitute a reduction of gene flow and loss of genetic variability as a result of habitat fragmentation. The ecological niche models (ENMs) of P. varaldii revealed fundamental environmental conditions along parts of the northeast Moroccan Atlantic and Mediterranean coastline. The species mainly inhabits well vegetated areas upon Quaternary soils at low altitudes. Proposed conservation actions include the development of a biannual monitoring program, identification and designation of protected areas within the distribution and development of a management plan for Mamora forest.},

abstract = {Forecasting the influence of climatic changes on the distribution of the Maned Wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) is important for the conservation of the species. We explored the environmental characteristics than best explain the current distribution of the species, modelled the past and present distribution, projected the niche model into the future, and identified suitable areas for conservation. Niche modelling was performed using Maxent and 21 environmental variables. For past conditions, we considered the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the mid-Holocene (MH) climates. For future conditions, we used the A2a greenhouse gas emission scenario for 2050. Four General Circulation Models (FGOALS 1.0, HADCM3, IPSL-CM4 and MIROC 3.2) were used. The resulting niche model (AUC=0.89±0.02) predicts maximum probability of presence at precipitation of 106mm during the coldest quarter, of 396mm during the warmest quarter, and in totally flat areas. The suitable area for the Maned Wolf currently covers 4,320,364km2. For the LGM, there were inter-model differences in predicted areas (from 819,324km2 to 6,395,886km2) and in geographic location. The MH models showed drastic changes with respect to the present and considerable inter-model variation. Predictions for 2050 show significant (at least 33{\%}) reductions in distribution. Only a minor fraction (39{\%}) of the current distribution can be considered stable for the period LGM-2050. The FGOALS model was the best option for projecting species occurrence into the future because it included the three localities known for the Maned Wolf from the late Pleistocene and predicts stable areas that coincide with spatial patterns of genetic diversity. The FGOALS projection for 2050 predicts a 33{\%} reduction in suitable habitats, indicating some stable areas (central South America) that will probably be key sites for the conservation of the species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Deutsche Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r S{\"{a}}ugetierkunde.},

In this paper we discussed two bayesian approaches called MaxBayes and IPPBayes based on Maxlike and IPP model, respectively. To illustrate these proposals, we implemented two study examples: (1) both models were implemented on a simulated dataset, and (2) we modeled the potencial distribution of genus Dalea in the Tehuacan-Cuicatl{\'{a}}n biosphere reserve with both models, the results was compared with that of Maxent. The results show that both models, MaxBayes and IPPBayes, are viable alternatives when species distribution are modeled with only-presence records.

In the real dataset example, both models predict similar potential distributions like Maxent does.},

abstract = {Bayesian mathematical model is the oldest method for modelling subjective degree of belief. If we have probabilistic measures with unknown values, then we must choose a different and appropriate model. The belief functions are a bridge between various models handling different forms of uncertainty. The conjunctive rule of Bayes builds a new set of a posteriori probability when two independent and accepted sets of random variable make inference. When two pieces of evidence are accepted with unknown values, the Dempster-Shafer's rule suggests a model for fusion of different degree of belief. In this paper we want to submit the use of MaxEnt principle for modelling the belief. Dealing with non-Bayesian sets, in which the piece of evidence represents the belief instead of the knowledge, the MaxEnt principle gives a tool to reduce the number of subsets representing the frame of discernment. The fusion a focal set with a set of max entropy cause a Bayesian approximation reducing mass function to a probabilistic distribution. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

The motivation of this work is to employ enhanced and better version of CT algorithm (smeared-MaxenT) as well as most updated ANSYS Fluent 14.0{\textregistered} software with proper modeling. Three-dimensional simulation of two phase flow has been done by using software platform of ANSYS Fluent 14.0{\textregistered}. The flow regimes considered in this work vary from churn-turbulent to bubbly flow. The changes in bubble diameter due to pressure are also considered. Improved and reliable estimation were reported using accurate CT algorithm and chord average projection data. Normalized logarithmic intensity ratio or a count per second (the beer-lambert law) is used as a projection data. It has been observed that CT results are in agreement with the Euler-Euler model when nitrogen hold-ups more than 10 percent. Mixture model shows negligible mismatch with CT result for low (less than 10 percent) nitrogen hold up. There is a mismatch in the nitrogen distribution near the wall using Euler-Euler model.},

abstract = {Ad{\'{e}}lie penguins (. Pygoscelis adeliae), carabeater seals (. Lobodon carcinophagus), humpback (. Megaptera novaeangliae), and minke whales (. Balaenoptera bonaernsis) are found in the waters surrounding the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Each species relies primarily on Antarctic krill (. Euphausia superba) and has physiological constraints and foraging behaviors that dictate their ecological niches. Understanding the degree of ecological overlap between sympatric krill predators is critical to understanding and predicting the impacts on climate-driven changes to the Antarctic marine ecosystem. To explore ecological relationships amongst sympatric krill predators, we developed ecological niche models using a maximum entropy modeling approach (Maxent) that allows the integration of data collected by a variety of means (e.g. satellite-based locations and visual observations). We created spatially explicit probability distributions for the four krill predators in fall 2001 and 2002 in conjunction with a suite of environmental variables. We find areas within Marguerite Bay with high krill predator occurrence rates or biological hot spots. We find the modeled ecological niches for Ad{\'{e}}lie penguins and crabeater seals may be affected by their physiological needs to haul-out on substrate. Thus, their distributions may be less dictated by proximity to prey and more so by physical features that over time provide adequate access to prey. Humpback and minke whales, being fully marine and having greater energetic demands, occupy ecological niches more directly proximate to prey. We also find evidence to suggest that the amount of overlap between modeled niches is relatively low, even for species with similar energetic requirements. In a rapidly changing and variable environment, our modeling work shows little indication that krill predators maintain similar ecological niches across years around Marguerite Bay. Given the amount of variability in the marine environment around the Antarctic Peninsula and how this affects the local abundance of prey, there may be consequences for krill predators with historically little niche overlap to increase the potential for interspecific competition for shared prey resources. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of biodiversity conservation strategies depends on the knowledge about the distribution of habitats or single species. Despite this, efforts on biodiversity monitoring and conservation are currently hindered by a lack of information about the spatial distribution of species on large landscapes. Predictive species distribution models, can provide a powerful tool for solving this ecological problem. The vast majority of data available for modelling plants distribution are herbarium data, which lack reliable records of species absence. Although it has been found that herbarium records do not meet current standards for sampling in ecological studies, they remain often the only available source of sufficient magnitude with regard to relevant distribution data. Modifying existing statistical tools and developing new methods so that herbarium data, despite their shortcomings, can be used for modelling habitat suitability, is currently a growing field. The aim of this paper was to analyse the opportunities and bottlenecks for future application of distribution models in the mapping and monitoring of habitats of conservation interest in a complex Mediterranean area. Here we specifically concentrate on testing the Maximum entropy (Maxent) approach to estimate the distribution of a training habitat through the use of herbarium records and to explore a GIS-based integrated approach. The results obtained highlighted the important role that distribution models can have in individuating the areas where a targeted species or habitat type is most likely to be found, and in showing where to commit the limited available resources for inventories. {\textcopyright} 2014, AL{\"{O}}KI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract = {In this study, we developed a stable and temporally dynamic model for predicting tsetse (Glossina pallidipes) habitat distribution based on a remotely sensed Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an indicator of vegetation greenness, and topographic variables, specifically, elevation and topographic position index (TPI). We also investigated the effect of drainage networks on habitat suitability of tsetse as well as factors that may influence changes in area of suitable tsetse habitat. We used data on tsetse presence collected in North western Zimbabwe during 1998 to develop a habitat prediction model using Maxent (Training AUC = 0.751, test AU = 0.752). Results of the Maxent model showed that the probability of occurrence of tsetse decreased as TPI increased while an increase in elevation beyond 800 m resulted in a decrease in the probability of occurrence. High probabilities ({\textgreater}50{\%}) of occurrence of tsetse were associated with NDVI between high 0.3 and 0.6. Based on the good predictive ability of the model, we fitted this model to environmental data of six different years, 1986, 1991, 1993, 2002, 2007 and 2008 to predict the spatial distribution of tsetse presence in those years and to quantify any trends or changes in the tsetse distribution, which may be a function of changes in suitable tsetse habitat. The results showed that the amount of suitable tsetse habitat significantly decreased (r2 0.799, p = 0.007) for the period 1986 and 2008 due to the changes in the amount of vegetation cover as measured by NDVI over time in years. Using binary logistic regression, the probability of occurrence of suitable tsetse habitat decreased with increased distance from drainage lines. Overall, results of this study suggest that temporal changes in vegetation cover captured by using NDVI can aptly capture variations in habitat suitability of tsetse over time. Thus integration of remotely sensed data and other landscape variables enhances assessment of temporal changes in habitat suitability of tsetse which is crucial in the management and control of tsetse. {\textcopyright} 2016},

Astroblepids occur in streams across a wide range of elevations (100-4600 m) and ecosystems from Panama to Bolivia, with most occurrences between 500 and 2000 m and associated with a narrow range of mean temperatures (17-24° C). The Maxent-predicted distribution was 83{\%} accurate, statistically significant (AUC = 0.965), and closely matched the known distribution, with few notable exceptions. Four environmental variables contributed a cumulative 84{\%} to the prediction, with elevation the most important, followed by temperature seasonality, isothermality and maximum temperature of the warmest month. The greatest discrepancy between the predicted and known distributions involved areas of predicted habitat suitability where there are no associated occurrence records. A jackknife test of variable contribution to the model showed that elevation contributed to the predicted distribution in ways not simply accounted for by temperature. Contrary to expectations, land cover type and vegetation characteristics contributed relatively little to the model prediction. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Conservation easements are an important tool for land stewardship by managing existing land use on private lands while allowing for continued private ownership and management. Conservation easements have been used to address a variety of conservation goals such as preserving wetlands for wildlife or constraining urban growth to conserve agricultural landscapes. Since conservation easements serve not just environmental but also social goals, understanding the pattern-process relationships of conservation easement placement can help illustrate current landscapes compared to future scenarios potential by linking current locations across the social and physical landscape. This paper examines the relationships of two types of conservation easements (i.e. environmental and farm) and projects similar potential locations based on just the physical landscape compared to both physical and social landscape by adapting the ecological model, Maxent, to land use modelling. Our results found that current conservation easement locations are modelled equally well using only environmental variables as social and environmental variables together. However, a comparison between projected potential conservation easement locations based on environmental versus socio-economic and environmental factors revealed little difference for environmental conservation easement, but a substantially different distribution for open space conservation easements. These results indicate potential areas to expand open space conservation easements that will serve different socio-economic groups than current locations and demonstrate the potential utility of this methodology for modelling current and future landscapes using the Maxent approach. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

A clear geographical bias was shown in museum records and supports the need for focused surveys. There was no correlation between the predicted distribution of L. cuprina and sheep farming in South Africa, nor between the predicted distribution of L. sericata and human population density.

In addition, regional climatic conditions could have an influence on relicts. Aims: Co-occurrence of environmental factors in the determination of the distribution of the glacial relict Festuca amethystina was examined in Poland. Methods: Climatic data, habitat indicator species, parent material of soils and range of glaciations were analysed, using ecological niche modelling. Prediction of Festuca amethystina occurrence for different sets of data – only climatic, only habitat and all data – was modelled. Results: The distribution of Festuca amethystina was related to the presence of oak forests (Potentillo albae-Quercetum), to moderate subcontinental climate, but not to the distribution of loess soils. In addition, variables related to temperature and precipitation in the driest quarter of the year, isothermality and a mean diurnal range had the strongest influence on the occurrence of F. amethystina within the Potentillo-Quercetum range. Conclusions: Climate acts as a regional filter and habitat availability as a local filter for distribution of the species. Therefore, the habitat can act as microrefugium in some parts of its range. In a flat landscape, relicts can persist where environmental conditions are simultaneously favourable for the persistence of refugial vegetation and relict populations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Background: Malaria remains the deadliest vector-borne disease despite long-term, costly control efforts. The United Republic of Tanzania has implemented countrywide anti-malarial interventions over more than a decade, including national insecticide-treated net (ITN) rollouts and subsequent monitoring. While previous analyses have compared spatial variation in malaria endemicity with ITN distributions, no study has yet compared Anopheles habitat suitability to determine proper allocation of ITNs. This study assesses where mosquitoes were most likely to thrive before implementation of large-scale ITN interventions in Tanzania and determine if ITN distributions successfully targeted those areas. Methods: Using Maxent, a species distribution model was constructed relating anopheline mosquito occurrences for 1999-2003 to high resolution environmental observations. A 2011-2012 layer of mosquito net ownership was created using georeferenced data across Tanzania from the Demographic and Health Surveys. The baseline mosquito habitat suitability was compared to subsequent ITN ownership using (1) the average ITN numbers per house and (2) the proportion of households with ≥1 net to test whether national ITN ownership targets have been met and have tracked malaria risk. Results: Elevation, land cover, and human population distribution outperformed variants of temperature and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in anopheline distribution models. The spatial distribution of ITN ownership across Tanzania was near-random spatially (Moran's I = 0.07). Householders reported owning 2.488 ITNs on average and 93.41 {\%} of households had ≥1 ITN. Mosquito habitat suitability was statistically unrelated to reported ITN ownership and very weakly to the proportion of households with ≥1 ITN (R2 = 0.051). Proportional ITN ownership/household varied relative to mosquito habitat suitability (Levene's test F = 3.0037). Quantile regression was used to assess trends in ITN ownership among households with the highest and lowest 10 {\%} of ITN ownership. ITN ownership declined significantly toward areas with the highest vector habitat suitability among households with lowest ITN ownership (t = -3.38). In areas with lowest habitat suitability, ITN ownership was consistently higher. Conclusions: Insecticide-treated net ownership is critical for malaria control. While Tanzania-wide efforts to distribute ITNs has reduced malaria impacts, gaps and variance in ITN ownership are unexpectedly large in areas where malaria risk is highest. Supplemental ITN distributions targeting prime Anopheles habitats are likely to have disproportionate human health benefits. {\textcopyright} 2015 Acheson et al.},

abstract = {Pinus tabulaeformis, as an endemic species in China, is one of the main tree species for afforestation. For rational cultivation planning and conservation, it is necessary to understand the geographical boundaries and the ecological characteristics of P. tabulaeformis, and to explore its priority afforestation areas. In this study, maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) was used to identify and prioritize suitable habitats of P. tabulaeformis, based on 13 climatic variables and GlobCover 2009 data. The results show that the MaxEnt model performs better than random prediction, with an average test area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.93 (0.91-0.94). Precipitation of wettest month (PWM), annual biotemperature (ABT), mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCM), annual mean temperature (AMT), precipitation of driest month (PDM), coldness index (CI), annual precipitation (AP), and mean temperature of the warmest month (MTWM) are identified as dominant variables which explain 94.6{\%} of variability the geographical distribution of P. tabulaeformis. Climatic conditions of P. tabulaeformis in the core area of its distribution are as follows: PWM, 100-246mm; ABT, 3.0-4.7°C; MTCM, -20.2 to -1.1°C; AMT, 2.9-14.7°C; PDM, 2-11mm; CI, -49.4-0°C; AP, 431-1122mm; and MTWM, 19.6-31.2°C. The suitable areas for afforestation are 2.6×104km2 (patches with an area {\textgreater}1km2), 1.6×104km2 (patches with an area {\textgreater}10km2), and 1.2×104km2 (patches with an area {\textgreater}100km2), which are mainly located in north Shaanxi, south Ningxia, and the middle of Gansu and Liaoning provinces with serious landscape fragmentation caused by human agricultural activities. Our simulation results can improve our understanding of the geographical and ecological characteristics of P. tabulaeformis and provide prediction of priority areas for afforestation of this species under current and future climate change scenarios in China. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Kingdonia uniflora Balf. f. et W. W. Smith, a perennial herb, is listed as an endangered plant of the national second-grade protection of China. In recent years, human activities (e.g. excessive deforestation and aggravating habitat fragmentation) have caused rapid shrinking of the distribution range of K. uniflora, thereby making this species being under serious risk of extinction. Prediction of potential suitable distribution of K. uniflora has important values for reasonable conservation and utilization of natural resource. In this study, 64 specimen records and 14 environmental factors were used to predict the potential suitable distribution and the key factors determining such distribution areas in China based on MaxEnt modeling and geographic information system (GIS). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was applied to produce modeling reliability of MaxEnt. As a result, the modeling process gave an AUC of 0.990 with high precision. Our results also showed that the highly potential distribution was mainly located in the north slope of Qinling Mountain in Shaanxi Province (Mei County, Taibai County), Qionglai Mountain (Li County, Maerkang County) and Daliang Mountain (Mabian County) in Sichuan Province, and the border zone including Dalou Mountain (Jinsha County) and Wumeng Mountain (Hezhang County) in the northeast of Yunnan and the northwest of Guizhou (suitability index {\textgreater}0.5). The Jackknife test analysis indicated that the main environmental factors determining the potential suitable distribution were annual average precipitation (contribution rate, 33.1{\%}), altitude (22.3{\%}), temperature seasonality (11.4{\%}), precipitation seasonality (7.2{\%}), topsoil pH (5.4{\%}), average monthly precipitation of January (5.1{\%}) and topsoil gravel content (4.9{\%}). The statistical analysis of environmental variables in highly potential areas demonstrated that K. uniflora prefers to grow in areas with high altitude (1646-2810 m), high annual average precipitation (856 mm), moderate average monthly temperature of January (-7.2 ℃) and topsoil pH 6.89. These results will provide valuable reference for conservation of the wild resource of K. uniflora as well as the establishment of nature reserves. {\textcopyright} 2015, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

abstract = {In the Hawaiian dry forest, 45{\%} of all tropical dry forest trees and shrubs are on the federal threatened and endangered species list. Research is needed to understand the current range of these endangered species, the factors that affect their current and future distributions, and ultimately, identify areas where the most successful restoration can be undertaken. This research uses species distribution modelling to predict the potential range of Hibiscus brackenridgei, the state flower of Hawaii and a federally endangered species found on Oahu. We used presence data and the modelling algorithm Maxent to model the current potential distribution of H. brackenridgei, identify climate and environmental variables that influence the species' distribution, and model the species' predicted future distribution based on a range of projected climate change scenarios. Statistical analysis suggests that the Maxent models accurately predict the species' distribution, and therefore, may be useful for conservation management. Comparing the current model with the future models of changes for 2060-2089, changes in the potential niche of H. brackenridgei only range by -4{\%} to 14{\%}. This suggests that the predicted changes in climate, under both low (B2a) and high (A2a) SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) global emissions scenarios, may not significantly impact the future distribution of H. brackenridgei on Oahu. We identified a total of 115 km2 of very highly (≥0.70) and highly (≥0.50) suitable habitat which represents potential areas where restoration projects could be implemented. This research suggests that threats like habitat loss, fire, invasive species, and grazing may be more important than climate for the future conservation of Hawaiian dry forest species.},

abstract = {Aim: Presence-only datasets represent an important source of information on species' distributions. Collections of presence-only data, however, are often spatially biased, particularly along roads and near urban populations. These biases can lead to inaccurate inferences and predicted distributions. We demonstrate a new approach of accounting for effort bias in presence-only data by explicitly incorporating sample biases in species distribution modelling. Location: Alberta, Canada. Methods: First, we used logistic regression to model sampling effort of recorded rare vascular plants, bryophytes and butterflies in Alberta. Second, we simulated presence/absence data for nine 'virtual' species based on three relative occurrence thresholds - common, rare and very rare - for each taxonomic group. We sampled these virtual species using our bias model to represent typical sampling effort characteristic of presence-only datasets. We then modelled the distributions of these virtual species using logistic regression and attempted to recover their original simulated distributions using a sample weighting term (prior weight) estimated as the inverse of probability of sampling. Bias-adjusted model estimates were compared to those obtained from random samples and biased samples without adjustment. We also compared prior-weight adjustment to bias-file and target-group background approaches in Maxent. Results: Sample weighting recovered regression coefficients and mapped predictions estimated from unbiased presence-only data and improved model predictive accuracy as evaluated by regression and correlation coefficients, sensitivity and specificity. Similar model improvements were achieved using the Maxent bias-file method, but results were inconsistent for the target-group background approach. Main conclusions: These results suggest that sample weighting can be used to account for spatially biased presence-only datasets in species distribution modelling. The framework presented is potentially widely applicable due to availability of online biodiversity databases and the flexibility of the approach. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Biotic interactions and land uses have been proposed as factors that determine the distribution of the species at local scale. The presence of heterospecifics may modify the habitat selection pattern of the individuals and this may have important implications for the design of effective conservation strategies. However, conservation proposals are often focused on a single flagship or umbrella species taken as representative of an entire assemblage requirements. Our aim is to identify and evaluate the role of coexistence areas at local scale as conservation tools, by using distribution data of two endangered birds, the Little Bustard and the Great Bustard. Presence-only based suitability models for each species were built with MaxEnt using variables of substrate type and topography. Probability maps of habitat suitability for each species were combined to generate a map in which coexistence and exclusive use areas were delimitated. Probabilities of suitable habitat for each species inside coexistence and exclusive areas were compared. As expected, habitat requirements of Little and Great Bustards differed. Coexistence areas presented lower probabilities of habitat suitability than exclusive use ones. We conclude that differences in species' habitat preferences can hinder the efficiency of protected areas with multi-species conservation purposes. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account the role of biotic interactions when designing conservation measurements. {\textcopyright} 2014 Tarjuelo et al.},

abstract = {Species distribution modeling has relevant implications for the studies of biodiversity, decision making about conservation and knowledge about ecological requirements of the species. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the use of forest inventories can improve the estimation of occurrence probability, identify the limits of the potential distribution and habitat preference of a group of timber tree species. The environmental predictor variables were: elevation, slope, aspect, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and height above the nearest drainage (HAND). To estimate the distribution of species we used the maximum entropy method (Maxent). In comparison with a random distribution, using topographic variables and vegetation index as features, the Maxent method predicted with an average accuracy of 86{\%} the geographical distribution of studied species. The altitude and NDVI were the most important variables. There were limitations to the interpolation of the models for non-sampled locations and that are outside of the elevation gradient associated with the occurrence data in approximately 7{\%} of the basin area. Ceiba pentandra (sama{\'{u}}ma), Castilla ulei (caucho) and Hura crepitans (assacu) is more likely to occur in nearby water course areas. Clarisia racemosa (guari{\'{u}}ba), Amburana acreana (cerejeira), Aspidosperma macrocarpon (pereiro), Apuleia leiocarpa (cumaru cetim), Aspidosperma parvifolium (amarel{\~{a}}o) and Astronium lecointei (aroeira) can also occur in upland forest and well drained soils. This modeling approach has potential for application on other tropical species still less studied, especially those that are under pressure from logging. {\textcopyright} 2015, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia.

abstract = {Maintaining habitat and its connectivity is a major conservation goal, especially for large carnivores. Assessments of habitat connectivity are typically based on the output of habitat suitability models to first map potential habitat, and then identify where corridors exist. This requires separating habitat from non- habitat, thus one must choose specific thresholds for both habitat suitability and the minimum patch size that can be occupied. The selection of these thresholds is often arbitrary, and the effects of threshold choice on assessments of connectivity are largely unknown. We sought to quantify how habitat-suitability and patch-size thresholds influence connectivity assessments for jaguars (Panthera onca) in the Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve in central Mexico. We modeled potential habitat for jaguars using the species distribution modeling algorithm Maxent, and assessed potential habitat connectivity with the landscape connectivity software Conefor Sensinode. We repeated these analyses for 45 combinations of habitat suitability based thresholds and minimum patch sizes. Our results indicated that the thresholds influenced connectivity assessments greatly, and different combinations of the two thresholds yielded vastly different map configurations of suitable habitat for jaguars. We developed an approach to identify the pair of thresholds that best matched the jaguar occurrence points based on the connectivity scores. Among the combinations that we tested, a threshold of 0.3 for habitat suitability and 2 km2 for minimum patch size produced the best fit (area under the curve = 0.9). Surprisingly, we found low suitable habitat for jaguars in most of the core areas of the reserve according to our best potential habitat model, but highly suitable areas in the buffer zones and just outside of the reserve. We conclude that the best and most connected potential areas for jaguar habitat are in the central eastern part of the Sierra Gorda. More broadly, landscape connectivity analyses appears to be highly sensitive to the thresholds used to identify suitable habitat, and we recommend conducting sensitivity analyses as introduced here to identify the optimal combination of thresholds. {\textcopyright} 2016},

The Maxent modeling software was used to estimate the current potential and future distribution of the associations by the year 2050 (2xCO2 climate conditions, CCM3 model). Based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), climate data at the collection sites described climatic preferences of different aquatic associations. The central-eastern part of the investigated area showed the most favorable climatic conditions for aquatic vegetation growth and thus the highest potential for future biodiversity. The stands of Lemnetum trisulcae, Ceratophyllo-Azolletum filiculoides, Najadetum marinae, Salvinio natantis-Spirodeletum polyrhizae, Elodeetum canadensis and Potametum denso-nodosi associations displayed a marked invasive potential in the forecasted distribution scenarios. The results revealed that the stands of Nymphaeetum albae and Nymphaeo albae-Nupharetum luteae subass. nupharetosum associations are likely to be significantly less abundant in the future. As the key climatic factors used in the analysis were annual mean temperature, as well as mean temperature of the wettest and warmest quartile, the findings suggest that, if adequate protective measures shall not be taken, these provenances could become degraded in the next decade and some could even become extinct at the locations where they presently occur naturally. {\textcopyright} 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

The goals of this study were to demonstrate a relatively simple post-hoc method to include spatial context in SDMs and to quantify the improvement over purely niche-based models. The method involved producing a standard niche-based model using established techniques, such as Maxent, and then calculating the neighbourhood average of the model output in geographic space. In effect, we tested whether the spatially averaged model output was better at predicting species distributions than the raw model output. We demonstrated the method using 32 tree species on the Illawarra Escarpment and found the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) increased by a mean of 0.021 using this method. The improvements were largest for eucalypts, which have poor dispersal ability and clustered distributions. Improvements were smaller for moist rainforest species, which were restricted to small areas with sufficient shelter from hot, dry northwesterly winds. We conclude that it is relatively easy to add spatial context into species distribution models using this post-hoc method, and the resulting models are better for predicting species' distributions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Two methods for obtaining the bubble size and velocity are compared: (i) estimation from the chord lengths and velocities of the detected bubbles using information from two virtual voidage probes (pierced bubble method) and (ii) calculation from the bubble volume and velocity directly obtained from the instantaneous 3D voidage field (tomography method). The Maximum Entropy method (MaxEnt) is employed to convert probability density functions of chord lengths into the corresponding diameter distributions. The algorithm for the direct evaluation of the bubble volume and velocity, based on the tomography reconstruction of the 3D field, is explicitly explained and used to evaluate the results obtained from the virtual void probe signals. Results show a good agreement between the bubble sizes obtained using the MaxEnt treatment of the chord lengths and the directly obtained bubble sizes, which confirms the robustness of the MaxEnt method to infer bubble behavior in 3D bubbling beds. In particular, the mean bubble diameter obtained with the MaxEnt method applied to chord lengths was less than 4.5{\%} different to the result from the tomography reconstruction. It was found that the bubble velocities obtained from virtual voidage probes are higher than the bubble velocities calculated with the tomography method, but the differences were not greater than 17{\%} in the worst case. The probability density functions of bubble size and velocity obtained with the two methods were similar in terms of the location of the most probable values and the variation of the distribution with the distance to the distributor. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Insect pests are a major threat to agricultural biosecurity across the world, causing substantial economic losses. Majority of the species distribution modeling studies use precise coordinates (latitude/longitude) of species occurrences in MaxEnt (or maximum entropy model). However, lack of precise coordinates of insect pest occurrences at national/regional level is a common problem for many countries including India. This is because of the limited resources, lack of nationally coordinated surveys, and growers/farmers' privacy issues; district-level occurrences are commonly available (e.g., National Agricultural Pest Information System or NAPIS in the United States; http://pest.ceris.purdue.edu/). We demonstrated the use of MaxEnt to generate a preliminary, district-level map of the potential risk of invasion by an exotic cotton mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis (Tinsley) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) in India. District-level occurrence data were integrated with bioclimatic variables (values averaged within districts) using MaxEnt. The MaxEnt model performed better than random with an average test AUC value of 0.86 (±0.05). Our model predictions matched closely with the documented occurrence of P. solenopsis in all nine cotton growing states, and also predicted suitable habitats in other districts across India. The greatest threat of P. solenopsis infestations were predicted in most districts of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, southwestern Punjab, northwestern Rajasthan, and western Haryana. Precipitation of coldest quarter, temperature annual range, and precipitation seasonality were the strongest predictors associated with P. solenopsis distribution. Precipitation of coldest quarter was negatively correlated with P. solenopsis occurrence. Mapping the potential distribution of invasive species is an iterative process, and our study is the first attempt to model national-level risk assessment of P. solenopsis in India. Our results can be used for selecting monitoring and surveillance sites and designing local, regional and national-level integrated pest management policies for cotton and other cultivated crops in India. The maps of potential pest distributions are urgently needed by agriculture managers and policymakers. Our approach can be used in other countries that lack precise coordinates of insect pest occurrences and generate a preliminary map of potential risk because it may be too late to wait for the precise coordinates of pest occurrences to generate a perfect map. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Constructed-response (CR) items pose many challenges to the education community - one of which is that they are expensive to score by humans.

abstract = {At the European Level, SACs (Special Areas of Conservation) are considered among the most reliable tools for increasing the efficiency of protective actions and to identify species vulnerability hotspots across spatial scales. Nevertheless, SACs may fail in their scope when design and management are not dynamically adapted to meet ecological principles. Knowledge of the spatial distribution of relevant key species, such as common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), is crucial in order to achieve the objective of the Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC), and is a fundamental step in the process of Marine Spatial Planning. From this perspective, new data and analysis are required to produce forecasts at spatio-temporal scales relevant to individual organisms. Here, we propose a study based on a MaxEnt modelling exercise to define the spatial distributional patterns of bottlenose dolphin at different temporal scales (over periods of multiple months and years) to increase the ecological understanding of how the species use the eco-space, and to delimit boundaries of a SAC in the waters surrounding Lampedusa Island, a hotspot for cetaceans in the Southern Mediterranean Sea. We show that bottlenose dolphin prefer shallower feeding grounds that often host complex and rich food webs, but also that this preference is constrained by disturbance factors such as boat traffic. As sea-related tourism, including dolphin-watching, is one of the most important economic activities of the island, the study results can be used from a management perspective, in order to reach a solution regarding two apparently conflicting needs - species protection and economic development. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

This mollusc, considered one of the 100 world's worst invasive alien species, is the focus of intense concern due to its impact on agriculture, human health, and native fauna. We tested two commonly used ecological niche modeling methods: Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP) and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt).

Models were evaluated with the threshold-independent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Area Under the Curve (AUC). Both models had consistent performances with similar areas predicted as susceptible, including areas already affected and new potentially susceptible areas in both tropical and temperate regions of South America.},

We modelled the climatically suitable breeding conditions of 24 Arctic specialist shorebirds and projected them to 2070 and to the mid-Holocene climatic optimum, the world's last major warming event {\~{}}6000 years ago. We show that climatically suitable breeding conditions could shift, contract and decline over the next 70 years, with 66–83{\%} of species losing the majority of currently suitable area. This exceeds, in rate and magnitude, the impact of the mid-Holocene climatic optimum. Suitable climatic conditions are predicted to decline acutely in the most species rich region, Beringia (western Alaska and eastern Russia), and become concentrated in the Eurasian and Canadian Arctic islands. These predicted spatial shifts of breeding grounds could affect the species composition of the world's major flyways. Encouragingly, protected area coverage of current and future climatically suitable breeding conditions generally meets target levels; however, there is a lack of protected areas within the Canadian Arctic where resource exploitation is a growing threat. Given that already there are rapid declines of many populations of Arctic migratory birds, our results emphasize the urgency of mitigating climate change and protecting Arctic biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

We conducted two modeling projects, one in Northwest U.S. and the other in Alaska, to evaluate the potential of improving species distribution models by combining deductive and inductive modeling approaches for over 1,000 taxa. Our objectives were to map each species' range, produce an inductive distribution model based on species occurrence records using Maxent and a deductive distribution model using expert knowledge of species-habitat associations, combine their output, and compare their relative strengths and limitations. While the two projects were independent, but related, in general, our methods included compiling species occurrence records, environmental variables, habitat associations, and assessing model accuracy. We had 342 deductive and 213 combined models in Northwest U.S. and 222 deductive, 74 inductive, and 37 combined models in Alaska selected as final models. Despite extensive efforts to filter occurrence data for our inductive models, our deductive models were often selected as the final models and were comparable to combined models. How well a deductive, inductive, or combined model represented a species distribution depended on the quality and quantity of input data. We found that collecting high-quality occurrence data, assembling accurate environmental data, obtaining rigorous expert input, and addressing sampling bias were vital. Our modeling efforts have improved the existing data, modeling, and understanding of many taxa.

There are two fundamental requirements in engineering: formal modeling and quantitative modeling. We must emphasize that metrics for software engineering is insufficient in quantification now. In order to improve software and software processing, the factors that affect schedule, cost and quality of software development should be measured. Metrics produces adjustable and iterative motions in software processing. Based on Jaynes' maximum entropy principle, this paper establishes a model to quantify the factors and introduces distance to compare the metric indicators. The authors propose that the metric estimation tree can be used and the nodes that stand for the software attributes in the tree can be marked with their corresponding evaluation values.

abstract = {Species distribution models are used for a range of ecological and evolutionary questions, but often are constructed from few and/or biased species occurrence records. Recent work has shown that the presence-only model Maxent performs well with small sample sizes. While the apparent accuracy of such models with small samples has been studied, less emphasis has been placed on the effect of small or biased species records on the secondary modeling steps, specifically accuracy assessment and threshold selection, particularly with profile (presence-only) modeling techniques. When testing the effects of small sample sizes on distribution models, accuracy assessment has generally been conducted with complete species occurrence data, rather than similarly limited (e.g. few or biased) test data. Likewise, selection of a probability threshold - a selection of probability that classifies a model into discrete areas of presences and absences - has also generally been conducted with complete data. In this study we subsampled distribution data for an endangered rodent across multiple years to assess the effects of different sample sizes and types of bias on threshold selection, and examine the differences between apparent and actual accuracy of the models. Although some previously recommended threshold selection techniques showed little difference in threshold selection, the most commonly used methods performed poorly. Apparent model accuracy calculated from limited data was much higher than true model accuracy, but the true model accuracy was lower than it could have been with a more optimal threshold. That is, models with thresholds and accuracy calculated from biased and limited data had inflated reported accuracy, but were less accurate than they could have been if better data on species distribution were available and an optimal threshold were used. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

We used the distributions of endemic and endemic-threatened species of Myrtaceae to indicate areas of plant diversity and conservation importance within the Atlantic coastal forests (Mata Atl{\^{a}}ntica) of Brazil. We applied 3 simple, inexpensive geographic information system (GIS) techniques to a herbarium specimen database: predictive species-distribution modeling (Maxent); complementarity analysis (DIVA-GIS); and mapping of herbarium specimen collection locations. We also considered collecting intensity, which is an inherent limitation of use of natural history records for biodiversity studies. Two separate areas of endemism were evident: the Serra do Mar mountain range from Paran{\'{a}} to Rio de Janeiro and the coastal forests of northern Esp{\'{i}}rito Santo and southern Bahia. We identified 12 areas of approximately 35 km2 each as priority areas for conservation. These areas had the highest species richness and were highly threatened by urban and agricultural expansion. Observed species occurrences, species occurrences predicted from the model, and results of our complementarity analysis were congruent in identifying those areas with the most endemic species. These areas were then prioritized for conservation importance by comparing ecological data for each. {\textcopyright} 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.},

Through comparative ecological niche modelling based on {\textgreater}1100 occurrences, we assessed whether the niche dynamics (i.e. niche shift versus conservatism) of the two species in their European ranges reflected DNA-based demographic scenarios. Sensitivity analyses and projections of climatic niche models from the species' native ranges (Africa and Middle East) to Europe yielded support for (1) partial climatic niche shift in the northern European range of the common genet and (2) climatic niche conservatism in the Egyptian mongoose. Our results were consistent with demographic scenarios that predicted multiple introductions and demographic expansion in the common genet and long-term, stable historical demography in the Egyptian mongoose. Our models further predicted a range expansion of the common genet in north-western France and Italy, and progression of the Egyptian mongoose into Europe from the Near East. Overall, our study suggested a scenario of different niche dynamics in Europe for these two species of African carnivores, supporting the view that historical factors such as dispersal and demographic history may shape niche dynamics and thus distribution potential in colonized ranges. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Linnean Society of London.},

The geological events contributed to orogenic gold mineral systems in the region. In the present study, mineral systems approach was employed to evaluate critical ore-forming processes such as fluid migration pathways, the formation of trap zones, and deposition of metals. By means of translating these critical processes into mappable ore-controlling variables, we attempt to establish a process-based quantitative evaluation model. A maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model was proposed to predict the potential distribution of orogenic gold deposits based on known gold deposits/occurrences, and ore-controlling variables. Nine ore-controlling variables including fault intersection density, fault linear density, the first factor score map, Au singularity indices, Au regional anomaly, Au local anomaly, proximity to NE-trending faults, proximity to intrusion contacts and proximity to stratigraphic contacts, were selected to identify the most potential zones endowed with gold deposits. The spatial association of individual ore-controlling variable with the incidence of gold deposit occurrences was investigated by response curves, and the relative importance of each ore-controlling variable was determined by jackknife analysis in the MaxEnt model. The results indicate that Au regional anomaly derived from spectrum-area (S-A) fractal model is the most important variable, followed by the first factor score map and proximity to stratigraphic contacts. The model accuracy was evaluated by ROC curve giving a high predictive ability (AUC = 0.915). Favorable zones for gold mineralization illustrated by the prospectivity map are spatially coincident with known gold deposits/occurrences and the main mineralized trends, showing that the MaxEnt model can be efficiently employed for spatial fusion analysis of multisource geospatial data to support conceptual mineral systems modeling of geologic controls on mineral deposit occurrences. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Explaining the distribution of a species by using local environmental features is a long-standing ecological problem. Often, available data are collected as a set of presence locations only, thus precluding the possibility of a desired presence-absence analysis. We propose that it is natural to view presence-only data as a point pattern over a region and to use local environmental features to explain the intensity driving this point pattern. We use a hierarchical model to treat the presence data as a realization of a spatial point process, whose intensity is governed by the set of environmental covariates. Spatial dependence in the intensity levels is modelled with random effects involving a zero-mean Gaussian process. We augment the model to capture highly variable and typically sparse sampling effort as well as land transformation, both of which degrade the point pattern. The Cape Floristic Region in South Africa provides an extensive class of such species data. The potential (i.e. non-degraded) presence surfaces over the entire area are of interest from a conservation and policy perspective. The region is divided into about 37000 grid cells. To work with a Gaussian process over a very large number of cells we use a predictive spatial process approximation. Bias correction by adding a heteroscedastic error component has also been implemented. We illustrate with modelling for six different species. Also, a comparison is made with the now popular Maxent approach though it is limited with regard to inference. The resultant patterns are important on their own but also enable a comparative view, for example, to investigate whether a pair of species are potentially competing in the same area. An additional feature of our modelling is the opportunity to infer about biodiversity through species richness, i.e. the number of distinct species in an areal unit. Such an investigation immediately follows within our modelling framework. {\textcopyright} 2011 Royal Statistical Society.},

abstract = {Most methods tor modeling species distributions from occurrence records require additional data representing the range of environmental conditions in the modeled region. These data, called background or pseudo-absence data, are usually drawn at random from the entire region, whereas occurrence collection is often spatially biased toward easily accessed areas. Since the spatial bias generally results in environmental bias, the difference between occurrence collection and background sampling may lead to inaccurate models. To correct the estimation, we propose choosing background data with the same bias as occurrence data. We investigate theoretical and practical implications of this approach. Accurate information about spatial bias is usually lacking, so explicit biased sampling of background sites may not be possible. However, it is likely that an entire target group of species observed by similar methods will share similar bias. We therefore explore the use of all occurrences within a target group as biased background data. We compare model performance using target-group background and randomly sampled background on a comprehensive collection of data for 226 species from diverse regions of the world. We find that target-group background improves average performance for all the modeling methods we consider, with the choice of background data having as large an effect on predictive performance as the choice of modeling method. The performance improvement due to target-group background is greatest when there is strong bias in the target-group presence records. Our approach applies to regression-based modeling methods that have been adapted for use with occurrence data, such as generalized linear or additive models and boosted regression trees, and to Maxent, a probability density estimation method. We argue that increased awareness of the implications of spatial bias in surveys, and possible modeling remedies, will substantially improve predictions of species distributions. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

The black-faced spoonbill (Platalea minor) is an endangered migratory species and endemic to East Asia. Using a maximum entropy approach, we predicted the potential wintering distribution for spoonbills and modeled the effects of future climate change. Elevation, human influence index and precipitation during the coldest quarter contributed most to model development. Five regions, including western Taiwan, scattered locations from eastern coastal to central mainland China, coastal areas surrounding the South China Sea, northeastern coastal areas of Vietnam and sites along the coast of Japan, were found to have a high probability of presence and showed good agreement with historical records. Assuming no limits to the spread of this species, the wintering range is predicted to increase somewhat under a changing climate. However, three currently highly suitable regions (northeastern Vietnam, Taiwan and coastal areas surrounding the South China Sea) may face strong reductions in range by 2080. We also found that the center of the predicted range of spoonbills will undergo a latitudinal shift northwards by as much as 240, 450, and 600 km by 2020, 2050 and 2080, respectively. Our findings suggest that species distribution modeling can inform the current and future management of the black-faced spoonbill throughout Asia. It is clear that a strong international strategy is needed to conserve spoonbill populations under a changing climate. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

According to the hydrological requirements for the spawning, daily flow data from 40 flow gages in the historic period (1950-1962) and the current period (1989-2010) were downloaded for the calculation of three important ecological hydrological fators: high flow, high flow duration and zero flow days. In combination with 25 other environmental factors, three species distribution model based on the theory of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) were established to analyze the contribution and influence of three flow metrics to the predicted distribution. The classical method (Receiver Operating Characteristic, ROC) and Parolo's calculation of the Spearman's rho correlation coefficient before and after the transfer of the models were used to evaluate the model fit and transferability of the models. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) greater than 0.95 and the Spearman's rho value greater than 0.6 for all the three models showed the good model fit and transferability of the models. Of the three flow metrics, high flow made the highest contribution to the model fit and had the most significant effect on the potential distribution of the fish. In different period, the species occurrence probability changed differently as the flow metric varied. Our study could provide valuable references for the protection of endangered fish in China. {\textcopyright} 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All right reserved.},

abstract = {The distribution of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) in Mexico has received renewed interest recently because of the discovery of domesticated H. annuus in early archaeological deposits in Tabasco (ca. 2600 cal. BC) and elsewhere in Mexico. The modern distribution of wild sunflower was ascertained through extensive collecting in Mexico and by examining existing collections in relevant herbaria. We further modeled the ecological niche projected as a potential distribution of wild sunflower using point occurrence data, environmental variables, and a GIS platform. Predicted distributions were statistically significant and more coincident with independent test points than random expectations. Interestingly, the ecological niche model predicted that wild sunflower should occur at various localities in the southern part of Mexico, yet it has never been collected there, nor did survey transects reveal any wild populations there. The intervening Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt acting as a physical barrier to dispersal or biotic interactions from the presence of a high diversity of tropical Asteraceae and intense insect predation may provide explanations for the absence of wild H. annuus in southern Mexico. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The University of Chicago.

abstract = {Aim An important consideration when planning to conserve a species under climate change is to understand how the distribution of its food resources may also contract or shift under those same climatic conditions. Here, we use a case study to demonstrate a spatial conservation planning approach to inform decisions about where, under climate change, to protect and restore critical food and habitat resources for highly specialized species. Location Eastern Australia. Methods We developed fitted models for the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) and five of its key eucalypt food trees using the maximum entropy algorithm available in Maxent. We then projected these models using a range of IPCC A1FI climate change scenarios and identified areas with a higher probability of occurrence. We calculated where the koala and its food trees may co-occur under future climate change. Results The koala and its food trees experienced significant range contractions as climate change progressed, sometimes to regions outside their current distributions. The inland species Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus coolabah contracted from the more arid interior, which is outside the koala range, but persisted in the eastern regions of the koala's range, while Eucalyptus viminalis, Eucalyptus populnea and Eucalyptus tereticornis contracted eastwards and southwards, with a fragmented distribution. The highest probabilities of overlap between koalas and their food trees were identified in fragmented coastal and southern regions of the koala's current range. Main conclusions The application of a robust species distribution modelling decision support tool identified important changes, under climate change, in the distribution of a specialist species and its key food trees. These distributions did not change in complete synergy and therefore areas of overlap varied, depending on the food tree species modelled. This is of particular importance in a conservation planning context, when considering targeted protection and restoration of species-specific habitat resources. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Widely distributed species often show strong phylogeographic structure, with lineages potentially adapted to different biotic and abiotic conditions. The success of an invasion process may thus depend on the intraspecific identity of the introduced propagules. However, pest risk analyses are usually performed without accounting for intraspecific diversity. In this study, we developed bioclimatic models using MaxEnt and boosted regression trees approaches, to predict the potential distribution in Europe of six economically important Tephritid pests (Ceratitis fasciventris (Bezzi), Bactrocera oleae (Rossi), Anastrepha obliqua (Macquart), Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann), Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh) and Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillet)). We considered intraspecific diversity in our risk analyses by independently modeling the distributions of conspecific lineages. The six species displayed different potential distributions in Europe. A strong signal of intraspecific climate envelope divergence was observed in most species. In some cases, conspecific lineages differed strongly in potential distributions suggesting that taxonomic resolution should be accounted for in pest risk analyses. No models (lineage- and species-based approaches) predicted high climatic suitability in the entire invaded range of B. oleae - the only species whose intraspecific identity of invading populations has been elucidated - in California. Host availability appears to play the most important role in shaping the geographic range of this specialist pest. However, climatic suitability values predicted by species-based models are correlated with population densities of B. oleae globally reported in California. Our study highlights how classical taxonomic boundaries may lead to under- or overestimation of the potential pest distributions and encourages accounting for intraspecific diversity when assessing the risk of biological invasion.

abstract = {Model transferability (extrapolative accuracy) is one important feature in species distribution models, required in several ecological and conservation biological applications. This study uses 10 modelling techniques and nationwide data on both (1) species distribution of birds, butterflies, and plants and (2) climate and land cover in Finland to investigate whether good interpolative prediction accuracy for models comes at the expense of transferability - i.e. markedly worse performance in new areas. Models' interpolation and extrapolation performance was primarily assessed using AUC (the area under the curve of a receiver characteristic plot) and Kappa statistics, with supplementary comparisons examining model sensitivity and specificity values. Our AUC and Kappa results show that extrapolation to new areas is a greater challenge for all included modelling techniques than simple filling of gaps in a well-sampled area, but there are also differences among the techniques in the degree of transferability. Among the machine-learning modelling techniques, MAXENT, generalized boosting methods (GBM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) showed good transferability while the performance of GARP and random forest (RF) decreased notably in extrapolation. Among the regression-based methods, generalized additive models (GAM) and generalized linear models (GLM) showed good transferability. A desirable combination of good prediction accuracy and good transferability was evident for three modelling techniques: MAXENT, GBM, and GAM. However, examination of model sensitivity and specificity revealed that model types may differ in their tendencies to either increased over-prediction of presences or absences in extrapolation, and some of the methods show contrasting changes in sensitivity vs specificity (e.g. ANN and GARP). Among the three species groups, the best transferability was seen with birds, followed closely by butterflies, whereas reliable extrapolation for plant species distribution models appears to be a major challenge at least at this scale. Overall, detailed knowledge of the behaviour of different techniques in various study settings and with different species groups is of utmost importance in predictive modelling. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate if speciation in allopatric species in Barkeria occurred in a scenario of ecological niche conservatism. Barkeria is a Mesoamerican orchid genus with fifteen species found in scattered forests in the Pacific mountains of Mesoamerica. Most species grow in seasonal tropical dry forests and a few also occupy oak, pine and pine-oak forests. Phylogenetic, molecular dating, ecological niche modeling and niche conservatism analyses were performed to determine phylogenetic relationships among species and to test for patterns between species relatedness and ecological niche traits. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were conducted with nuclear and plastid DNA markers. Ecological niche modeling was run in MaxEnt. Evolutionary models of niche and climatic distances were estimated to determine if the niches in the Barkeria tree were conserved and if speciation in pairs of allopatric sister species retrieved in the phylogeny was influenced by climate. Barkeria is a young genus that has colonized the Pacific dry forest since the middle Pliocene to the Pleistocene. The fit of the phylogenetic Barkeria tree to a stasis model of evolution as well as the lack of phylogenetic signal under a Brownian motion model suggest strong niche conservatism of its species. However, factors other than climate influenced speciation in the allopatric sister species. The patchy distribution and differences in the vegetation of tropical dry forests of Mesoamerica as well as geographical barriers may have influenced speciation in Barkeria. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Aim: Information on the association between geographical patterns of hybridization and the climatic niche requirements and co-occurrence of the species involved can provide important insights that further our understanding of the factors promoting the formation of hybrid zones. Here, we test whether climatic niche suitability explains patterns of hybridization beyond spatial overlap in distributions of the geographically restricted Engelmann oak (Quercus engelmannii) and the widespread scrub oak species complex (Quercus spp.). Location: Southern California, USA. Methods: We sampled Engelmann and scrub oaks across 31 localities and genotyped 343 individuals at nine microsatellite loci. We used climatic niche modelling to assess the suitability of habitats for each parental species and hybrids and to analyse whether climatic niche suitability in addition to cooccurrence are associated with observed spatial patterns of hybridization. Results: Our data indicated that hybrid zones are located in areas that are geographically constrained by the presence of scattered patches of Engelmann oak within a matrix broadly occupied by scrub oaks. However, the climatic niche of hybrids differed from that occupied by both Engelmann and scrub oaks, suggesting the importance of climate on their establishment and persistence beyond the simple role of geographical overlap of parental species distributions. We also found that even moderate levels of introgression contributed to increased genetic diversity in Engelmann oak but not in scrub oaks. Main conclusions: These results show that hybrid zones follow a mosaic pattern constrained by the presence of scattered patches occupied by Engelmann oak and climatically suitable areas that favour the establishment of hybrids. The low rates of ongoing hybridization and the bimodal distribution of parental genotypes found here suggest that hybridization is not threatening Engelmann oak and this phenomenon could instead be promoting the acquisition of favourable alleles that may increase the adaptive potential of this vulnerable species. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Climate change (CC) constitutes one of the main biodiversity threats. The effects of CC on species are apparent worldwide, with primarily poleward and upward shifts in species distribution. Due to their narrow distribution, threatened species are highly vulnerable to CC. In this context, protected areas (PA) could be key tools for adaptation to CC. Our aims were to study the effects of CC on the distribution and richness of the threatened and near threatened amphibians of Uruguay; and to evaluate the effectiveness of the National Network of Protected Areas (NNPA) at present and under future climate scenarios. To model the distribution of nine species, we obtained records from herpetological collections, scientific publications and GBIF, as well as current data and future climate projections of the General Circulation Model HadCM3 under the A2 and B2 IPCC scenarios from Worldclim. To model species distribution we applied maximum entropy techniques (MAXENT). To evaluate the effectiveness of NNPA we conducted a gap analysis by overlaying PA with the distribution of species. The models indicate that the distribution of most amphibian species could expand in Uruguay in the future; except for Pleurodema bibroni y Melanophryniscus montevidensis. Local amphibian richness is predicted to increase, mainly in the northwest and east of the country. While amphibians studied are included in at least one PA, less than 2{\%} of the distribution is actually covered by the NNPA, both currently and under CC scenarios; which it is a strong indicator of the inefficiency of the system. Although projected CC for this region would not constitute a major threat to amphibians studied, the scarce protection by the NNPA represents a risk to the conservation of herpetofauna facing the other components of global change. {\textcopyright} 2016, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

abstract = {The primary objectives of the effectiveness monitoring plan for the marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) include mapping baseline nesting habitat (at the start of the Northwest Forest Plan [the Plan]) and estimating changes in that habitat over time. Using vegetation data derived from satellite imagery, we modeled habitat suitability by using a maximum entropy model. We used Maxent software to compute habitat suitability scores from vegetation and physiographic attributes based on comparisons of conditions at 342 sites that were occupied by marbled murrelets (equal numbers of confirmed nest sites and likely nest sites) and average conditions over all forested lands in which the murrelets occurred. We estimated 3.8 million acres of higher suitability nesting habitat over all lands in the murrelet's range in Washington, Oregon, and California at the start of the Plan (1994/96). Most (89 percent) baseline habitat on federally administered lands occurred within reserved-land allocations. A substantial amount (36 percent) of baseline habitat occurred on nonfederal lands. Over all lands, we observed a net loss of about 7 percent of higher suitability potential nesting habitat from the baseline period to 2006/07. If we focus on losses and ignore gains, we estimate a loss of about 13 percent of the higher suitability habitat present at baseline, over this same period. Fire has been the major cause of loss of nesting habitat on federal lands since the Plan was implemented; timber harvest is the primary cause of loss on nonfederal lands. We also found that murrelet population size is strongly and positively correlated with amount of nesting habitat, suggesting that conservation of remaining nesting habitat and restoration of currently unsuitable habitat is key to murrelet recovery.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are powerful tools to predict species distributions, and thus support invasion risk assessments for tree species at the global scale. However, SDMs may produce different species distribution probabilities depending on the spatial scale of climate data included in the model. Hence, we must understand impacts of the climate data scale on the modeled distribution probabilities of invasive tree species (ITS) throughout the world. We used nine ITS from the list of “The 100 of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species” as our study species, and applied Maxent modeling based on presence and background points to model the distribution probabilities of these ITS across the globe using three climate data scales: 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0′. The average distribution probabilities of presence and background points across the nine focal ITS increased significantly from the 2.5 to the 10.0′ resolution, indicating that coarse climate data scales may increase the distribution probabilities of presence and background points for these focal species. The large gap between different climate data scales resulted in high prediction uncertainty for the distribution probabilities of ITS. We offer two suggestions for decreasing the prediction uncertainty of the distribution probabilities of ITS at the global scale due to the effects of the climate data scale when using SDMs: 1) use 5.0′ resolution as the input to SDMs when using GBIF or other specimen databases; and 2) decrease the gap between 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0′ in the number of presence points of ITS. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Species that exhibit geographically defined phenotypic variation traditionally have been divided into subspecies. Subspecies based on phenotypic features may not comprise monophyletic groups due to selection, gene flow, and/or convergent evolution. In many taxonomic groups the number of species once designated as widespread is dwindling rapidly, and many workers reject the concept of subspecies altogether. We tested whether currently recognized subspecies in the plain-bellied watersnake Nerodia erythrogaster are concordant with relationships based on mitochondrial markers, and whether it represents a single widespread species. The range of this taxon spans multiple potential biogeographic barriers (especially the Mississippi and Apalachicola Rivers) that correspond with lineage breaks in many species, including other snakes. We sequenced three mitochondrial genes (NADH-II, Cyt-b, Cox-I) from 156 geo-referenced specimens and developed ecological niche models using Maxent and spatially explicit climate data to examine historical and ecological factors affecting variation in N. erythrogaster across its range. Overall, we found little support for the recognized subspecies as either independent evolutionary lineages or geographically circumscribed units and conclude that although some genetic and niche differentiation has occurred, most populations assigned to N. erythrogaster appear to represent a single, widespread species. However, additional sampling and application of nuclear markers are necessary to clarify the status of the easternmost populations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
