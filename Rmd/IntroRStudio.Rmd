This is just a foolaround file with the new RStudio shortcuts (available at file:///Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/www/docs/keyboard.htm).  

1.  Assignment - supposed to be option -, however only works in chunk
2.  pipe operator - CmdSftM -- %>% -- works fine
3.  output yaml can be modified by clicking on the gear wheel at the top of the editing pane, followed by output options
4.  Note - under global options/rmarkdown, uncheck show chunk output inline to retain traditional RSTudio look 

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100,0,1)
hist(x)
```
