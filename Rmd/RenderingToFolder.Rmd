We want to develop a function to render markdown-created html to a particular folder, and then perhaps develop an lapply function to do all of the conversions.
```{r}
library(rmarkdown)
```
Now see if we can render something without designating the package.

render ("./Rmd/file",output_dir="../html")

An example
```{r}
render("./Rmd/BasicR.Rmd",output_dir="../html")
```
So now a function to mass render everything (no doubt will have errors)
